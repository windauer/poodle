                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- Are marketing and media giants ignoring the fact that their primary communications channels are based on environmentally "toxic" pixels? And are some of these companies engaging in "tree washing" or "gray washing" as well as "green washing?" These intriguing issues were at the center of this week's Sustainable Media Climate Symposium in Manhattan. Don Carli, director of the Institute for Sustainable Communication, enlightened many by quantifying how the carbon footprint of electric-powered digital media is nearly as large and environmentally onerous as that of the notorious paper-making industry.</description>

And, the group and its director, Julius Dunn, were well liked throughout Manhattan's advertising community. In fact, in October, JWT held a party for Adversity in the agency's New York headquarters office. But shortly after that, The One Club suddenly announced that it was ending its partnership with the group. In this nine-minute video interview, Mr. Dunn discusses that split.</description>

Its innovative moves in this area are one of the reasons that VP for Global Media Services Mark Stewart was honored as an Ad Age Media Maven this year. In his remarks at Wednesday's ceremony, he underscored Kraft's determination to do even more of what it formerly depended on traditional magazine publishers to do.</description>

He's CMO at Kodak, a company that has suffered one of the century's most stunning implosions. With its product lines decimated by the digital revolution, the film and camera equipment marketer that employed 145,000 people in 1988 now has less than 20,000. Hayzlett's job is to market the crippled giant back to technological relevance. And he's as much a cheerleader as he is a formidable stage presence in that effort. This video is an excerpt of one of his latest performances.</description>

                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- In the 47-year timeline of Wal-Mart's history, few years can match 2006 for marketing chaos. In January of that year, Julie Roehm, an edgy Chrysler marketing executive, became Wal-Mart's SVP of marketing communications only to be dismissed twelve months later. Wal-Mart named Stephen Quinn the new CMO with a mandate to return the company to its traditional marketing vision. In this program, Mr. Quinn, now riding atop one of the recession's most successful retail operations, reflects on what was learned during those those troubled days of 2006.</description>

He also predicted that ad agencies would be getting "very much more involved" in the development of content and that the lines between advertising and editorial are going to get "much more blurred" than they already are today.</description>

He was speaking at the recent Apps for Brands conference produced by Ad Age and Appolicious. On the positive side, he went on to offer practical advice to print publishers who have yet to wrestle their way into the apps world.</description>

At the same time, he finds that ad agencies in general don't really understand the dramatically different process of communicating with consumers from within a video game system. This nine-minute program is part II of our interview with Slavin, a former ad agency executive and co-founder of New York's Area/Code.

                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) --  The "Big Idea" has long been the traditional core of ad campaign organization but does it really work that well in the new age of social marketing? That was the issue raised at the recent 4As' strategic planning session by Mark Earls. The author and marketing guru discussed new insights about the behavior of human communities and warned marketers and their agencies not to assume that a single creative concept will work effectively across a wildly diverse and unpredictably fluid social environment.</description>

But in the first two quarters of this year, sales have dropped just as dramatically for the Piaggio subsidiary. But Vespa marketing campaigns continue at full throttle. Last week, the parking lot of Central Park's Tavern on The Green was turned into a maze of test riding tracks for members of the media. And Piaggio Americas' CEO predicted that U.S. consumers would become serious scooter users over the next five years.</description>

But he didn't call a press conference or tap a friendly editor to do it. Instead, he directly made news with his blog on Yardbarker.com. It was the latest example of how the Yardbarker ad network and celebrity-athlete blogging hub is becoming a growing presence in the world of sports media. </description>

                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- New York times Op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof has become an unlikely evangelist for digital games as a new form of journalism. In fact, he's so taken with the idea that he's developing an online game to go with his new book due out in the fall. Authored with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, it's a serious work about the oppression of third-world women. In this keynote address at the recent Games for Change Festival in Manhattan, Kristof explained how an MTV game had opened his eyes to the true power of that online messaging format as a reporting tool.</description>

The show is set in an advertising agency rather than a fashion magazine and, so, enables the program to focus on all manner of products and their attributes. Mateo Eaton, who heads the branded content division of Mindshare North Asia, admits that the dense placements are a bit over the top, but advertisers -- and the TV producers they're paying -- aren't complaining at all.</description>

According to CEO Jason Kilar, the strategy has been incredibly effective. In his on-stage interview at the 4As Leadership Conference, Mr. Kilar said Hulu's Super Bowl ad was directly responsible for increasing the online video portal's business by 49%. Also, curiously, Mr. Kilar revealed that Hulu does not have -- and does not want -- a marketing department.</description>

                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- Newspaper readers have long paid less than it actually costs to deliver the product to their homes. And now, as newspaper companies struggle to survive, those readers should pay the real costs of that service. That was one of the suggestions made by Hearst Newspapers president Steven Swartz at this week's Future of Newspapers Panel. That event at Columbia University's Journalism School explored the dire straits in which print publishers like Swartz find themselves.</description>

Although digital piracy gets all the publicity, it's only one of several trends that have converged into a choke hold on music industry revenue streams.

Speakers did their best to pump up industry morale from the stage but the fear among attendees was palpable throughout the corridors and quiet gathering places of the event. In one of its more curious sessions, a series of consumer panelists raved about the value of various forms of media in their lives -- even as executives in the audience bemoaned their inability to sufficiently monetize many of those digital formats.</description>

The effort, which kicked off in Grand Central Terminal this week, follows the peanut-related salmonella outbreak believed to have killed nine, sickened more than 600 and triggered a recall of 3,000 different food products. The National Peanut Board will be using print, TV, outdoor and radio ads in an effort to rebuild consumer confidence in peanut butter and other products.</description>

She even suggests the creation of a web portal that would enable Gen Y-ers to post their wants in an organized manner -- so appropriate marketers could more quickly and efficiently respond to them.</description>

                    <description>NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- It's long been a frustration as well a revenue limitation for ad agencies that digital marketing is so dominated by direct sales pitches rather than broad-based brand-building strategies. And the Interactive Advertising Bureau is now making that issue a major action priority. At its annual conference in Orlando this week, CEO Randall Rothenberg called on marketers to fundamentally re-think their approach. At the same time, the IAB is launching a new advisory board and an online creativity bootcamp to show them exactly how it's done.</description>
