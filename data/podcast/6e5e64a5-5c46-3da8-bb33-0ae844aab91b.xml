Got a friend who might like the show? How about a friend who might not like the show? Either way, this episode is a great introduction to what we're all about. Tie them down and force them to listen to about ten minutes of premium comedy! At your trial, you'll be able to say with confidence, "I have no regrets!"

That, and we'll love you forever!</description>

By my count we were up to 4 false promises that the episode would be out "that night." But let's put the past behind us! The episode is out now and in the end, isn't that all that really matters? Thanks for waiting!

Going to be doing a big push for listeners in the coming months so if you get a minute, consider introducing a friend to the show, tweeting about us with the hash tag #AFistfulofPixels, or just giving us a review on iTunes! Every little bit helps!

This Week's Games: Surviving the Con, Royal Moustache Rumble, Curling Manager 2012, Earth Vs Soup, Time Warp Trio, Teenage Mutant Ninja Podcasters, New England Chainsaw Massacre, Occupy World of Warcraft, File Exporter Parade, Ahhhh! Real Monster's House, The Last Layrngologist, Cooking Drug Lord: With Friends, Torrent Master Deluxe, Revenge of the Forgotten Pets, Pleasure Quest: Winona Ryder's Massage, Primal Primates:  Lemur Love Lessons, Subaqueous Owl

                    <description>This week, it's a spooky-ass Halloween episode as A Fistful of Pixels welcomes professional voice actor Bob Ball. He helps us deal with difficult questions such as "How many air buddies movies are there?", "Is it possible to use a slim jim as a horcrux?", and "What happened to Whoopi Goldberg's brother, Rube?"

Bob Ball can be found at www.BobBallVO.com, @BobBallVO, and PopQuizzical.com
