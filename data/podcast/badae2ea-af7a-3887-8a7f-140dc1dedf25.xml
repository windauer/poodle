        1)Individuals with Alzheimers disease will have increasing difficulty with finances over time, and the very first signs of this difficulty will occur prior to the diagnosis of dementia, when they have only mild cognitive impairment.
        2) Health care professionals, including physicians, should educate older adult patients and families about the need for advance financial planning and encourage the use of Durable Power of Attorney for Financial Matters.
        3) Using objective information from performance-based financial tests can help decide whether, when, and in which financial areas families or caregivers need to assume proxy financial responsibility.

        1)Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk increases beginning at systolic blood pressure levels of 115 mmHg and the use of antihypertensive medications among patients with a history of CVD or diabetes and without hypertension has been debated.
        2) Among patients with clinical history of  CVD but with blood pressure lower than 140/90 mmHg, antihypertensive treatment was associated with decreased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, composite CVD events, and all-cause mortality.
        3) Additional randomized trial data are necessary to assess these outcomes in patients without CVD events.

        1) Axillary dissection is a major cause of morbidity after breast Cancer surgery.
        2) In women who have 3 or fewer sentinel nodes and are have breast conserving surgery, removal of only the sentinel nodes produces local axillary control in 99% of cases.
        3) Axillary dissection does not contribute to survival.
        4)In women with T1 and T2 clinically node negative BR CA who are undergoing lumpectomy and whole breast radiation, removal of sentinel nodes only is an appropriate management strategy.

        1) One third of Medicare managed care patients diagnosed with RA are not receiving DMARDs.
        2) There is variation in DMARD receipt based on accidental factors: sociodemographics, geographic location, and health plan.
        3) Since DMARD use is the main way to affect outcomes in RA, these patient groups and the physicians treating them are reasonable target for quality improvement interventions.

        1) The findings suggest that the zoster vaccine is as effective in a community setting with its mixed population and routine clinical practices as was found in the controlled clinical trials.
        2) To date, the uptake of the zoster vaccine has been modest due to a number of reasons, including weaknesses in the adult vaccine infrastructure, knowledge and beliefs of clinicians and patients, periodic supply shortfalls as well as financial reasons.
        3) Because zoster and its attendant neurologic complication of postherpetic neuralgia are common and serious among the elderly, it seems prudent to recommend zoster vaccine. The potential impact of vaccination on the burden of the disease in this population is significant.

        1) Active surveillance is a reasonable approach to consider for carefully-selected 65 year old men with low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer, providing improved quality of life even if associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific death.
        2) The results depend on patient preferences

        1.) When evaluating adolescents and adults with persistent cough illness, the presence of classic symptoms of pertussis (paroxysmal cough, whooping cough, post-tussive emesis) modestly increase the likelihood of pertussis, and their absence modestly decreases the likelihood of pertussis; but they are not strong enough to rule-in or rule-out disease.
        2.) Most patients in whom pertussis is suspected will not derive symptomatic benefit from antibiotic treatment because their illness duration is usually &gt; 10 days.
        3.) Vigilant testing and treatment should be provided to adolescents and adults who have been exposed to a known case of pertussis, or have contact with individuals at high risk for serious complications of pertussis, ie, child care providers and teachers, health care workers, and patients who live or work with infants under 6 months of age; unvaccinated children; or immunosuppressed individuals.

        1.  Careful alcohol histories are needed for all patients, particularly to identify binge drinking, which is frequent among moderate and especially younger drinkers.
        2.  Even moderate alcohol consumption has important and plausible health effects based on short-term trials and observational studies, including lower risk of heart disease presumably via higher HDL-cholesterol and higher risk of breast cancer (presumably via higher levels of estrone and DHEA sulfates).
        3.  Given these points, even controlled alcohol consumption is unlikely to benefit younger drinkers, but is a reasonable point of discussion for middle-aged and older adults, especially as a launching point for education about problem drinking and the potential risks and benefits of including alcohol as part of a healthy diet in older age.

        1. Falls are common health events that cause discomfort and disability for older adults and stress for caregivers. Previous falls; strength, gait and balance impairments; and medications are the strongest risk factors for falling.
        2. The most effective strategy for reducing the rate of falling in community-living older adults may be intervening on multiple risk factors including strengthening and balance exercises through physical therapy, medication reduction, environmental modifications to reduce fall hazards, cataract surgery. Vitamin D has strong evidence of benefit for preventing fractures among older men at risk and probably of preventing falls in all at risk older adults.
        3. While challenges and barriers exist, fall prevention strategies can be incorporated into clinical practice.

        1. Falls are common health events that cause discomfort and disability for older adults and stress for caregivers. Previous falls; strength, gait and balance impairments; and medications are the strongest risk factors for falling.
        2. The most effective strategy for reducing the rate of falling in community-living older adults may be intervening on multiple risk factors including strengthening and balance exercises through physical therapy, medication reduction, environmental modifications to reduce fall hazards, cataract surgery. Vitamin D has strong evidence of benefit for preventing fractures among older men at risk and probably of preventing falls in all at risk older adults.
        3. While challenges and barriers exist, fall prevention strategies can be incorporated into clinical practice.

                    <itunes:summary>
        1. A clinical trial is a powerful tool for showing whether an intervention works, but the heterogeneity of trial participants means it is a mistake to assume that the overall (or group) benefit of an intervention found in such a trial is the same for every participant.
        2. The absolute benefit of an intervention is greater for trial participants (and for patients generally)  whose baseline risk for a bad outcome is high than it is for those whose baseline risk is low.
        3. A quality improvement program in any one organization is like an individual patient, in the sense that it is highly complex, is unstable (i.e., changes over time), and its local circumstances are unique, all of which make it hard (although not impossible) to judge whether a quality improvement program in any particular setting actually works, and to know whether it would work elsewhere.

        1. A conventional evidence-based approach is modified by 3 important caveats: prognosis, insufficient evidence, and patient goals and preferences.
        2. Conceptually, the care of older persons can be dividide into 3 time frames: short term, which focuses on remediating the current problems; mid-range, focussing on preventive and foreseeable problems; and long-range, which focus on eventual decline and living arrangements.
        3. Individual providers need to structure their practices to efficiently and comprehensively accommodate the diverse needs of elderly patients.

        1) The most likely cause of acute onset monocular floaters or flashes is posterior vitreous detachment and if left untreated vitreous detachment complicated by retinal tear can progress to vision-threatening retinal detachment.
        2) A minimum approach to evaluating a patient with suspected posterior vitreous detachment should include a history of change in vision or curtain of darkness, measurement of visual acuity and assessment of confrontational visual fields.
        3) High-risk features for retinal tear in the setting of acute posterior vitreous detachment are subjective or objective visual acuity loss, monocular visual field loss (or curtain of darkness), and vitreous pigment or hemorrhage on slit-lamp examination and patients with any of these clinical findings should be referred for same day ophthalmology assessment.

        The effectiveness of screening depends on the underlying biology of cancer. Depending on the growth rates and metastatic potential of the tumor, screening may or may not be effective. Screening is much less effective than we had hoped for aggressive tumors as they can metastasize even when small or grow rapidly and present as interval tumors. For slow growing tumors with very low metastatic potential, early identification will not improve outcome and screening can lead to the identification of additional lesions not destined to become a clinical problem (both invasive and preinvasive lesions), and may be responsible for 20-30% of cancers detected by screening.
        There are ways that we can improve screening today 1-limit it to the populations who are most likely to have the tumors where early detection makes a difference (The USPSTF guidelines are a good start) 2- work to improve the diagnostic accuracy, especially with mammography (using trained mammographers to interpret images), and minimize biopsy recommendations for very low risk lesion; Use shared decision making to discuss screening, prepare patients for results, and consider prevention interventions as part of the risk assessment process when high risk individuals are identified. 3- use available tools to predict tumor behavior of screen detected tumors, and consider less aggressive interventions as appropriate.
        We can and must do better- we need to work to identify populations at risk for the most aggressive tumors where screening is less effective, and find better treatment and prevention strategies. It is very important to invest in large scale demonstration projects to better determine risk factors for specific biologic types of cancer, and test less aggressive interventions both for screening and treatment- of low risk tumors.

At a population level, a large fraction of all new cases of hypertension could hypothetically be prevented if all individuals in the population followed combinations of healthy lifestyle factors; according to the findings of the study, this fraction may is 78%. Given that hypertension is a leading cause of preventable death in the population, and given that the majority of hypertension may be preventable through lifestyle modification, efforts should be intensified to improve lifestyle as a means of improving public health.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>There are now published consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Acute viral rhinosinusitis and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis can be difficult to distinguish in the first 10 days of symptoms. Radiologic imaging is often ?positive? in both viral and bacterial etiologies of acute sinusitis and therefore cannot be used to distinguish the two. Oral antibiotics when prescribed appropriately confer a higher rate of partial or complete resolution of acute sinusitis symptoms compared to placebo. However, it should be noted that the spontaneous rate of resolution of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis may be as high as 40-60%. Adjunctive therapies such as topical and oral decongestants may offer symptomatic relief but have not been proven to shorten the duration of illness.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Cardiovascular disease accounts for 35% of the excess mortality in African Americans, in large part because of hypertension. Racial disparities in physicians? clinical decision-making and in quality of care for cardiovascular disease have been documented extensively; studies also show racial differences in patient-physician communication, particularly when the patient and physician come from different racial backgrounds, and unconscious racial biases among physicians. A categorical approach that lumps patients of particular cultural backgrounds into groups and outlines their characteristics values, customs and beliefs may lead to over-simplication and stereotyping. Instead, an understanding of broad cultural concepts and skills that emphasize a patient-centered approach are preferred. This approach takes into account the individual patients? explanatory model, illness agenda and behaviors, and social context, and attitudes and skills with regard to negotiating treatment. It also includes participatory behaviors such as asking open-ended questions, using reflective listening, and avoiding arguments in which one tries to change the patient?s views.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Burnout and compassion fatigue are fundamentally different phenomena. Understanding the difference is helpful for effective intervention. Investments in self-awareness and self-care are sound business strategies that can be expected to reduce staff turnover and increase patient satisfaction. Mindfulness meditation and reflective writing have both been shown to increase self-awareness and self-care. They are among a number of strategies that can be built into clinical practice to prevent burnout and compassion fatigue.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Smoking is extremely common among persons with mental illness and exerts a huge toll in terms of morbidity and mortality. We are now in the midst of a culture change. Formerly smoking was an integral part of the mental health culture and smoking cessation was not deemed pertinent. Now it is evolving into an important component of mental health and wellness. Most smokers who have mental illness would like to quit. And many are able to do so, using the standard smoking cessation techniques used for the general population. There is still much more to know, but we know enough to encourage persons with mental illness to stop smoking and to provide them the tools to do so.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Drugs such as the alpha glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, which reduce the rate of digestion and absorption of carbohydrate and so flatten the post-prandial glycemic response have been shown to improve diabetes control, reduce the risk of developing hypertension and lower the risk for cardiovascular disease. Can a selection of more slowly digested carbohydrate foods achieve qualitatively similar benefits to drugs? Current data suggest that selection of diets containing low glycemic intake foods have modest benefits in reducing HbA1C even in type 2 diabetes patients treated with one to three antihyperglycemic medications. Foods with a low glycemic index include many traditional study foods such as dried peas, beans, lentils, intact grain breads, pasta, oats, barley, parboiled rice, and temperate climate fruits and berries. Low glycemic index starchy foods are digested less readily in vitro. Other effects include a tendency for higher HDL, lower CRP values and greater weight loss in the per protocol completers ie. those who completed the study with no change in medications.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Depression is a common and serious condition in patients with heart disease; therefore health care workers should inquire about symptoms of depression in their heart disease patients. Our recent systematic review shows that there is not sufficient evidence at this time to call for routine screening for depression in patients with heart disease. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal model(s) of care that will allow depression to be appropriately diagnosed and treated in patients with heart disease, particularly at times when these patients are being cared for primarily by heart disease experts rather than by experts in depression diagnosis and treatment.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>A majority (55.5% ) of Medicare patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) did not have a recommended stress test performed to document ischemia. The rate of stress testing before elective PCI shows significant geographic variation, from a low of 22% in Fresno, CA to a high of 71% in Rochester, MN. Patient characteristics (female sex, age of 85 years or older, and having co-existing illnesses) and physician characteristics (physicians who performed a higher volume of PCI procedures) were associated with lower rates of stress testing.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>The three primary pelvic floor disorders include urinary and fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. In a national population-based sample, nearly one-quarter of U.S. women reported at least one symptomatic pelvic floor disorder: overall, 15.7 percent experienced moderate to severe urinary incontinence, 9.0 percent experienced fecal incontinence at least monthly and 2.9 percent experienced symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (a bulge in the vagina they could see or feel). Older women, overweight and obese women and multiparous women were more likely to report a pelvic floor disorder.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Emergent sexual dysfunction (SD) is a principal reason for a three-fold increased risk of non-adherence that leads to increased relapse, recurrence, and poor disease management outcomes. Selective phosphodiesterase-type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), limited to studies in men, have demonstrated evidence based data to support broad based and clinically meaningful treatment efficacy. In an intention-to-treat analysis, women treated with sildenafil showed significant improvement in adverse sexual effects compared with those taking placebo. Evidence shows that selective phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are effective in both sexes for patients who have been effectively treated for depression but need to continue on their medication to avoid relapse or recurrence.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>If blood pressure (BP) control could be improved, many deaths from cardiovascular and renal disease could be prevented. The Chronic Care Model was used to design an intervention that empowered patients to be more involved in their own care using home BP monitoring, a patient shared electronic medical record, and Web-based pharmacist assistance. The group of patients that received BP monitors and training to use an existing patient website (with encouragement to send their BP numbers to their physician) had a modest decrease in systolic blood pressure, but BP control did not significantly improve. The group that received BP monitors, web training, and web-based pharmacy assistance had greater decreases in BP and were almost two times as likely to have controlled BP.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>People with symptoms of depression are more likely to engage in diabetes-producing health behaviors, including eating more, exercising less, and smoking more. As a consequence, they were more obese. People with elevated symptoms of depression had a 42 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 3 years. This was partially explained by unhealthy behaviors. People with treated type 2 diabetes had a 52 percent increased risk of developing depressive symptoms over 3 years. This suggests that individuals with diabetes should be monitored for development of depression.</itunes:summary>

The risk of a biopsy for a benign lesion in our series was 1 in 40 for women undergoing mammography vs. 1 in 10 for women undergoing mammography combined with ultrasound screening. Using the standardized technique and interpretive criteria developed for this study, other radiologists and facilities with similar equipment and experience should expect similar results.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Reducing LDL-C and SBP to lower targets resulted in regression of carotid atherosclerosis and decrease in LV mass in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Clinical event rate was low in both groups and did not differ. Longer term follow-up will be necessary to determine whether the aggressive targets result in favorable risks/benefits. More emphasis should be placed on reaching conventional targets for both LDL-C and SBP in diabetic patients. More trials are needed that evaluate targets for lipids and BP rather than specific treatment regimens.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>To make real progress in patient safety will require redesigning the underlying system of care such that healthcare professionals and institutions providing a continuum of services from prevention to hospice can address multiple conditions and episodes over time. Competing priorities, professional autonomy, solo and small physican practices, disciplinary silos, mis-aligned financial incentives, and inadequate feedback about performance all undermine efforts to create safe healthcare systems. A number of strategic, cultural, techncial, and strucural barriers need to be addressed to assure safer care.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Antibiotics are not so effective in the routine treatment of cases of acute sinusitis even when of probable bacterial origin, and should therefore be used more judiciously and with greater caution. Expectations should not necessarily be for antibiotics but balanced risk assessments and symptom advice are still important. Findings of lack of efficacy for antibiotics should drive a research agenda which aims to identify subgroups that might benefit from their use and/or other types of treatment.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Pedometer users increase their physical activity by walking 2000 steps per day more than people who do not use a pedometer - 2000 steps is equivalent to about 1 mile per day or about 100 calories per day. Having a daily step goal is important for increasing physical activity with a pedometer. Pedometer users with any goal?either 10,000 steps per day or an individualized step goal?increase their physical activity whereas those pedometer users without a goal do not. Pedometer users lose weight and lower their blood pressure.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>The HPV vaccine has been shown to work very well in preventing new (incident) infection and disease caused by the HPV types targeted in the vaccine. JAMA study shows that HPV vaccination does not hasten clearance of existing (prevalent) infection with the HPV types targeted by the vaccine (HPV16 and 18). It is most cost-effective to administer the vaccine before patients are exposed to HPV, because the vaccine is effective in preventing new infection but does not appear to be effective in treating established infection.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Episodes of emotional stress, especially when sudden, severe and unexpected, may have significant adverse effects on the heart. Acute emotional stress can increase sympathetic stimulation of the heart and can alter brain activity in a way that makes the heart more susceptible to rhythm disturbances. Since episodes of emotional stress are almost inevitable in life, part of a healthy lifestyle is learning how to deal effectively with stress to make them less likely to lead to adverse effects; relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation, and other ways of responding to stress may be important for individuals to become familiar with to accomplish this.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>While aspirin is generally a safe drug, and extremely effective, with over 50 million US adults taking it everyday for cardiovascular disease prevention, even a very small incidence of side-effects can have major implications. In terms of preventing heart attacks, strokes or cardiovascular deaths no clinical trial has identified an aspirin dose more efficacious than 75 to 81mg daily. Although there is no dose of aspirin that doesn't increase the risk of GI toxicity or bleeding, greater doses of aspirin are consistently associated with a greater risk.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Evidence from two replicate RDBPC trials showed sumatriptan-naproxen as a fixed dose combination was superior in treating an attack of migraine when compared to sumatriptan alone, naproxen alone, or placebo. Most importantly, given that migraine attacks in adults are 4 to 72 hours in duration, the fixed dose combination of suma-naproxen was significantly more effective that sumatriptan monotherapy or naproxen monotherapy in providing a 24 hour sustained pain free response. Patients using the fixed dose combination therapy were less likely to use rescue medication or to have headache recurrence, and did not experience any penalty in side effects using the combination.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Screening and other prevention approaches involve subjecting very large numbers of people to an intervention, with the expectation that a few will benefit, but most will not (as they would have never developed the condition anyway). In general screening for diseases such as cancer will uncover some reservoir of abnormalities that appear to be precursors to clinical disease but are not yet causing disease. We really have no evidence to support screening for lung cancer right now with any technology. We really should be advocating for our patients to help them understand why they shouldn't have this test until we know that it is more likely to hurt them or help them.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Half of all heart attacks and strokes occur among those with normal cholesterol levels and 15-20% occur among those with no major risk factors at all. The major breakthroughs in understanding cardiovascular disease over the past decade include insights about inflammation and genetics. Each of these can easily be ascertained with either a simple blood test (hsCRP for inflamamtion) or a simple question about parental history of Myocardial Infarction. By incorporating these two new measures into how we think about risk, a new risk tool was derived known as the "Reynolds Risk Score". This is a win-win for everyone as it allows us to better target therapies, avoid toxicity, and improve overall prevention strategies for heart disease.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Screening for falls is as simple as asking the patient if she's fallen in the past year. For patients who have not fallen, ask about gait or balance problems (e.g. "Do you have a walking or balance problem?"). Most older patients who have a history of falls in the past year, or a gait/balance problem, have at least a 50% chance of falling in the coming year. You may want to do a more thorough evaluation on these patients. To make screening easy for new patients, add into your pre-visit questionnaire questions that ask about a history of falls and/or gait/balance problems. Or, have your office staff ask these questions routinely when patients are being checked in.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>The long term use of alendronate for up to 10 years is safe. Those who discontinued treatment at 5 years lost bone mass compared to those who continued but the bone loss was only moderate. Rates of fracture were similar among those who continued verses those who discontinued except for clinical vertebral fractures which, although relatively uncommon, were higher in those who discontinued treatment. Results suggest that after 5 years of alendronate, many women may discontinue therapy for up to 5 years. Although, those at high risk of clinical vertebral fracture may benefit by continuing.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Most cancer screening guidelines do not recommend screening elderly persons in poor health who have limited life expectancies because the harms of screening (which occur immediately) outweigh the potential benefits (which occur many years in the future). PSA screening rates among elderly men with limited life expectancies should be much lower than current practice to avoid harming these men with unnecessary tests and procedures. Guidelines should be more explicit about how life expectancy is defined and provide tools to help clinicians identify men with poor prognoses who are most likely to be harmed by PSA screening, considering both age and the presence of severe disease.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Wait-and-See Prescription (WASP) is a viable approach to managing children with acute otitis media. Compared with the standard prescription group, the WASP group filled the antimicrobial prescription much less frequently and had equivalent clinical outcomes. Within the WASP group, fever and ear pain were associated with filling the prescription demonstrating that parents are able to make appropriate care decisions when given clear guidance. In the management of acute otitis media, important points for clinicians are first to make right diagnosis and then to provide sufficient analgesia. Adequate pain control allows parents to better manage their sick child and use antimicrobials judiciously while also reducing the risk of medical side effects and antibiotic resistance.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>There is a new and novel pharmaceutical approach to treating nicotine addiction that helps smokers quit by specifically targeting nicotine receptors. Efficacy for varenicline was three-to four times that of placebo and twice that of bupropion at the end of 12 weeks of treatment, but abstinence rates in all groups declined after drug treatment ended. The launch of a new smoking cessation medication will likely drive patient demand for smoking cessation services. Medical practices should be prepared to respond to this demand by having a clear, systematic approach to smoking cessation.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Even though we have long assumed that clinicians should ask patients directly about intimate partner violence, this study shows that self-complete methods for soliciting such information are preferred by women, and may be more efficient. The prevalence rate for intimate partner violence differs by setting and population and varies significantly from approximately 4% to approximately 18%. While this study provides evidence on the best methods to solicit information on intimate partner violence, it doesn't tell us if collecting this information improves outcomes for women exposed to such violence. A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of screening women for intimate partner violence in health care settings is currently underway.</itunes:summary>

Embedded in experts' recommendations for colorectal cancer screening are nearly impossible demands on primary care clinicians to discuss the pros and cons of various modalities for screening with each patient and to assess risk even to the detail of learning the pathology of the biopsy of relatives' colonoscopies (e.g., adenomatous vs. hyperplastic polyps).</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>This week: The objective of this trial was to describe women's symptoms and management strategies after stopping menopausal hormone therapy, in this case, estrogen plus progestin. The study found that more than half of the women with menopausal symptoms prior to the trial also reported these symptoms after discontinuing use of the study pills. Women who had symptoms after they stopped study medication reported using a wide range of strategies to manage symptoms, many of them helpful. Investigation of alternative strategies to manage menopausal symptoms is warranted.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>This week: Updated recommendations on the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and latent TB infection exist. Prescribing an appropriate treatment regimen for TB and ensuring completion of therapy is best achieved with directly observed therapy, which is essential for curing patients with the disease, minimizing the risk of drug-resistant TB, and for enhancing TB control. Thus, treatment of TB often requires close collaboration between the public and private sectors. New drugs are needed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB. Better diagnostic tests for latent TB infection and shorter, safer treatment regimens are needed.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>This week: Dr. Kemer discusses how about half the children, age six and under with elevated blood lead levels, didn't receive follow up testing and among them, nonwhite children and those living in urban and other high-risk lead settings, were even less likely to receive follow up testing compared to their counterparts; thus proving the need for interventions to overcome disparities in care. These follow up tests for children with high blood lead levels are essential for managing lead poisoning and for maximizing cognitive development.</itunes:summary>
