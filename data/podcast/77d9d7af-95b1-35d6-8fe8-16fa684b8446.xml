                <description>The Tom &amp; Jo Show is a podcast based on the conversations of a real life couple, Tom &amp; Jo. Sometimes they have a few alcoholic beverages and spout wisdom so profound it needs to be shared with the world!

Disclaimer: Jo doesn't believe the Internet to be a tool for looking up facts during the show, and alcohol is occasionally consumed before &amp; during recording, so anything that isn't accurate at the time of recording can't be held against us.</description>

                    <description>The subject Tom has picked for Episode 4 of The Tom &amp;#038; Jo Show podcast is; which decade would you most have wanted to grow up in?

This is a bit of a vague question so many topics are touched on including fashion, the political climate, film and, of course, music. Our hosts do agree upon an answer, eventually and it may come as a surprise to you, it certainly did to Tom who had a very clear idea before talking about it out loud. Perhaps the phrasing of the question caught him out?

                    <description>This time, on The Tom &amp;#038; Jo show, our hosts debate the demise of the chart and its impact on young people.

Tom &amp;#038; Jo reminisce about a time when you would wait all week to see if your favourite band or artist had managed to claim the coveted Number One spot from whichever act you thought didn't deserve it last week. In a world before downloads and torrent sites made the Top 40 and Top of the Pops obsolete this was the talk of the playground and though it brought families together, it also highlighted the divide between your parent's musical taste and yours.

Feel free to extend the debate with us on our Facebook Page or on Twitter @TheTomAndJoShow (even though we didn't have the pages set up when this episode was recorded, we do now!), or even personally @heyitsmetom &amp;#038; @JoGirlyjo.

Tom &amp;#038; Jo go to great depths analysing the careers of these legendary actors both on and off-screen to come up with the most comprehensive argument you'll ever have heard on the subject.

They also do impressions, some good... some very bad!

(The editing of this podcast took a bloody age thanks to the software occasionally skipping, I've done my best to iron out the kinks, but some of the drops happened during key bits of dialogue. Give one of us a shout at @heyitsmetom or @jogirlyjo if you think you've missed anything important. - Tom)</description>

This time, Jo asks the question: "What would you rather be: a pirate or a cowboy?" Sit back and listen to them give the pros and cons of living the life of both occupations. Do you agree? Give us your feedback on Facebook (if you can find us) or Twitter at @jogirlyjo or @heyitsmetom.</description>
