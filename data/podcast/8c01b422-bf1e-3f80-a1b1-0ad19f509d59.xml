For this episode we celebrate the 25th anniversary of Street Fighter. Podcast regulars Gavin, Sarah and Stephen are joined by Brian, aka Doom, one of the most prominent members of the Irish fighting game scene and expert in all things Guile related.

Street Fighter had humble beginnings as a rather forgettable fighting game but that quickly changed with the release of the seminal Street Fighter 2. Street Fighter 2 set the template for all fighting games that followed and changed the arcade and competitive gaming scene. This explosion in popularity led to numerous updates, sequels and spin-offs. It’s not just street fighter, we also touch on the games the series influenced. Capcom’s rivalry with fellow fighting game developer SNK is discussed, Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct are openly mocked and we come to the conclusion that no fighting game will ever better the magnificent Dino Rex.

We’d also like to mention that on the 6th of October the Fighting Game Community Ireland is hosting a qualifying tournament for the 25th Masters Series to be held in Paris. Prizes include seeded positions in the main event, flights to and from Paris and accommodation. If you are interested in taking part more information and registration is available at: http://www.sf25.eu/</itunes:summary>

Tomb Raider is a media franchise consisting of video games, comic books, novels, theme park rides and movies, centring around the adventures of the fictional English archaeologist Lara Croft. Since the release of the original Tomb Raider in 1996, the series developed into a lucrative franchise of related media, and Lara went on to become a major icon of the virtual gaming industry. In 2006, Lara Croft was inducted into the Walk of Game and the Guinness Book of World Records has recognised her as the "Most Successful Human Virtual Game Heroine". The first six games in the series were developed by Core Design, whilst Crystal Dynamics developed the latest four; their fifth game is currently in production. Two movies - Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life - have been produced starring American actress Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, the first of which is still the highest-grossing film adaptation of a video game ever released in U.S., and third worldwide.
