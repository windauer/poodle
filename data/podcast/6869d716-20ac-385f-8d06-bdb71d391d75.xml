                    <description>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;Susan Loughnane is an actress, model, artist and writer who will be most recognisable to Irish audiences for her part of Debbie in Love/Hate. Susan’s path to get to where she is now will be very much unknown to the listener before this. From painting to help fund her way through studying acting in New York to experiencing her lowest ever confidence having just won an IFTA award Susan’s story is one that must be heard. In this interview Susan talks about relapsing into shyness, why she believes that her part on Britain’s Next Top Model was not necessarily a wise decision for her modelling career, how she still enjoys working ‘normal’ jobs occasionally in order to stay grounded and why she values fun over ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

Today Donal is most recognisable as a TV home cook, author and food photographer but many will be unaware of his journey to get there which includes being in bands which brought him two Irish number one hits and losing to Dustin the Turkey in Eurosong, packing everything in and starting from scratch with a new focus on more than just one occasion, letting romance take him to Sweden and working with Jamie Oliver. Donal opens up to Jarlath about how he has dealt with begrudgery towards him, how he deals with worry as well as giving his stance on the place and influence of food in today’s media.&lt;/p&gt;

In this week's episode Angela talks about how her childhood struggle with authority shaped her goals, the importance of trust and credibility and she also gives her opinion on the modern day sexualisation and image expectations of women. Angela's story explains why she believes most people are faking it until they make it, how she created her own fashion business which led to gaining clients such as Louis Vuitton and how she ended up being on Vogue magazine's one-to-watch list.

From having a career in professional rugby for Leinster which led him to representing Ireland in the under 21s World Cup to being the frontman of multiple award-winning band The Blizzards before embarking on a solo career and coaching on The Voice of Ireland. In this gripping episode Niall opens up about suffering with a general anxiety disorder which has led him to becoming an ambassador for mental health in Ireland. Niall also talks about why he was completely broke after a successful career with The Blizzards, why he believes the Brit School drains the ‘rawness’ out of artists before offering some sterling advice on how to fight back against mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;Multi award-winning director Lenny Abrahamson talks about living in a trailer while on a PhD scholarship to Stanford University before giving it all up and returning home to Dublin for reasons much deeper than homesickness. The man behind Adam and Paul, The Garage, Frank and What Richard Did also discusses learning how to fail and why being unable to walk out on a project has made him stronger while also offering up some sage advice to the listeners.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;This week Dermot O’Leary talks to Jarlath about being raised Irish in London as the son of a Wexford hurler, how he values hard work and why he believes that this generation of youths can save the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;Dermot’s story is a true tale of hard graft from working as a sports reporter who was unable to find his way to football grounds to dominating live television presenting in Britain for the last 15 years since getting his big break which led to hosting on Big Brother’s Little Brother before eventually becoming the host of XFactor. In this episode which was recorded at his BBC Radio 2 studio, Dermot speaks frankly about the importance of honesty, how he handled a now-famous difficult interview with Morrissey and why he likes people underestimating him.&lt;/p&gt;

Tony also talks about how he learned to become a winner, the importance of providing oneself with obstacles in order to be pushed to one’s limits, winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award and how his patience is tested with a diet and weight loss regime which has seen him lose 5 pounds in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;From humble beginnings as a promising young Cork athlete who was as interested in her college education as she was in turning professional to becoming one of the most recognised names in Irish sporting history, Sonia O’Sullivan’s journey literally takes her around the world. Sonia sits down with Jarlath to talk about the events that led to her becoming one of Ireland’s sporting heroes including how she was able to hide an injury to allow herself compete, what it was like to make a costly mistake in an Olympic final and not understanding the connection she had with the Irish public until she retired.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;From humble beginnings as a promising young Cork athlete who was as interested in her college education as she was in turning professional to becoming one of the most recognised names in Irish sporting history, Sonia O’Sullivan’s journey literally takes her around the world. Sonia sits down with Jarlath to talk about the events that led to her becoming one of Ireland’s sporting heroes including how she was able to hide an injury to allow herself compete, what it was like to make a costly mistake in an Olympic final and not understanding the connection she had with the Irish public until she retired.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;div&gt;From refusing a Manchester United apprenticeship at the age of 15 to becoming a Liverpool and Ireland footballing legend, Ronnie Whelan’s journey is an honest tale of putting hard work before talent, dealing with homesickness and staying grounded while at the pinnacle of one’s game. Ronnie reflects on his memories of captaining Liverpool on the day of the Hillsborough disaster, how his 15 year playing career came to an end in just 10 seconds and he also delves into stories from the golden era of the Irish football team.&lt;/div&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Kian Egan has experienced more highs and lows in his 33 years than most of us will experience in three lifetimes. This episode scratches the surface of how he discovered music as a 4 year old in Sligo, signing with Louis Walsh thanks to some classic Irish Mammyism and much much more. Incredibly frank and always brutally honest Kian surprises Jarlath with some truths about the music industry and his role in the biggest boy band in the history of Irish music.

                    <itunes:summary>Kian Egan has experienced more highs and lows in his 33 years than most of us will experience in three lifetimes. This episode scratches the surface of how he discovered music as a 4 year old in Sligo, signing with Louis Walsh thanks to some classic Irish Mammyism and much much more. Incredibly frank and always brutally honest Kian surprises Jarlath with some truths about the music industry and his role in the biggest boy band in the history of Irish music.This episode is sponsored by CurrencyFair, McClintock Eyewear and Vyke.

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin:0px;font-size:12px;font-family:Helvetica;"&gt;Four years ago Jack Reynor was still in secondary school, dodging classes and refusing to wear the uniform. Today he is regarded as the fastest rising young Irish actor in Hollywood. His journey from being broke in Wicklow to starring in blockbuster movies such as transformers has to be heard to be believed.
