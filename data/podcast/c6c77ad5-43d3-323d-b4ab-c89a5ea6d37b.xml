Share your vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited about todays episode with Carmine Gallo.  Carmine is a communications coach.  He helps large (like Fortune 100 companies large) tell their story.  He talks to CEO’s, Sales Teams, and all in between showing them the right way to tell their story and share their vision.  Today he talks with me, so you Appitalizers can hear him first hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmine mentions some great tips in our conversation - such as the “Twitter Friendly Headline”.  He explains that if you can’t share what you do in less than 140 characters - you can’t explain what you do.  He explains how you, when presenting either to a group of investors or even your family, need to make your story have 3 big components:
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today we interview Mindy Bickel from the US Patent and Trademark Office.  The USPTO and Cornell have teamed up to help entrepreneurs get informed and to learn about how to patent their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Appitalizer, you should now be &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; aware that you need to protect yourself and your ideas.  We have had lawyers on before to explain how to getting protected, but with Mindy we learn it from the other side.  Mindy’s goal with the program is to teach Appitalizer’s how to educate themselves with the process of patents.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m talking with Luis Giraldo, owner and CEO of &lt;a href="http://www.monkeybox.com"&gt;Monkey Box&lt;/a&gt; in Canada.  Luis who’s an Apple consultant by day (like me!) found something in his day to day that he needed.  He took that idea (what he calls his itch) and made it happen.  He was able to Appitalize on &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I love what Luis did has nothing to do with Monkey Box (despite it being a great app), but more with how he got it built.  Luis is a very smart person, but knew where his limits were.  He not only outsourced the programming, but he outsourced the marketing.  He brought in a marketing company to help write the “copy” on his website.  These small touches provided by the company helped Monkey Box  [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These small touches provided by the company helped Monkey Box appeal to not only other Apple consultants, but to individuals as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luis really understands the Appitalize movement, and it’s very evident in his wonderfully built product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I sit down with David Postolski of Day Pitney, LLP.  David is an Intellectual Properties lawyers in NY and today we discuss how, what and who should patent and protect their idea (the answer is everyone who has an idea!).  David and I talk about the need for protection.  How do you keep people from stealing your idea and making money when you should be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David breaks down the three major intellectual property types:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copyright&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trademark&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Patent&lt;/li&gt;

By giving up some things she likes to do, like watch TV, she is able to run her business.  Her time management skills have given her the ability to succeed where so many have failed.  If you have a passion, and an idea, there’s no reason to make sure you know what’s happening on the latest episode of The Blacklist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the whole interview, and how Liana has risen her business up and what her plans are for moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s episode is an amazing one with inventor Chris Hawker.  Chris, owner of Trident Designs and inventor talks about how he comes up with ideas.  Chris’ company has produced hundreds of products to be sold in the likes of Wal-Mart and Target.  Chances are you have something he thought of in your own home!  Chris really delves into how he started, and how you can come up with ideas just looking around.  “Every invention solves a problem,” he says.  I can’t agree anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;Today I decided to a do hostful episode.  I wanted to share with you two things that have been on my mind lately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is MVP - Minimum Viable Product.  When developing an idea you need to learn your core competency of your idea.  Build just that in your first version and get it out in the wild.  Don’t fall subject to “feature creature”.  Not sure what your core competency is?  Describe your product in 1 sentence, that’s it! For SignMyPad our core competency is “Sign PDF documents”, and SignMyPad allows you to do just that!  Many people want the product they build to be super polished but when there are over a million apps out there, being [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many people want the product they build to be super polished but when there are over a million apps out there, being first is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;The second thing I discuss this week is vetting a programming team.  Using &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guru.com" style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;Guru.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;, I have been able to find programmers such as my team in India and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://justinesgar.com/apc-episode-4-eyal-amir/" style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;Eyal Amir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt;"&gt;.  Guru.com has a lot of potential freelancer on the site so how do you weed out who’s good or not?  You need to be able to ask the right questions to the potential freelancer and look at their portfolio.  In the case of programmers, look at the apps they’ve created.  Look at the reviews of those apps and look for stand out reviews such as ‘app crashes’.  If you see a lot of that, don’t hire that team!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tips and tricks are available to help you bring your idea to fruition.  What idea are you work on this week?  Share it in the comments below or in iTunes.

Let’s start it off right by listening to todays Appitalize On Your Idea: The Podcast episode 6 with my guest Pam Lefkowitz from &lt;a href="http://www.corecomputing.com"&gt;Core Computing&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam is an Apple Consultant, who in her spare time likes to knit.  She tells us how there were no good ways to make graph paper patters digitally. So what did she do? She went out and made an app!

What I love the most about this interview is Michael’s story about one of their clients who had a notebook app. I don’t want to give away the secret (you should listen to the episode!) but what the creator of the app did was &lt;strong&gt;SUPER&lt;/strong&gt; creative.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone is a “marketing” person, but that can’t stop you from getting your products out there in peoples faces.

You have to have your strategy right, and be ready to take risks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll hear some great ideas from Michael, and she even gave me a great idea to start an Appitalize On Your Idea pinterest board with some motivational quotes.

I wanted to bring Dr. Bachar on to help people realize that fear can be overcome when building your idea.  We talk about how you can overcome fear by finding places to go to focus on your work, and realizing that while you project your passions on your ideas, you are not your idea as a person.  Dr. Bachar explains that a failure on an idea does not mean you are a failure as a person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also discuss how to be motivated.

In this episode I give a quick review of what the podcast is going to be, before interviewing our first guest &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/kylesamani"&gt;Kyle Samani&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.pristine.io"&gt;Pristine.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle and I discuss Pristine’s product, which is a video streaming tool for the medical industry.

His motivator? &lt;a href="http://www.stickk.com"&gt;Stickk.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Stickk is a site that motivates you by giving money from your account to a charity that you hate.
