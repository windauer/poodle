                    <itunes:summary>They were brave, they were bold and they laid down their lives to stop the marauding German and Japanese forces. But they did so for the British Empire and that was the reason they have been relegated to the footnotes of history. Men of honour, but no one to commemorate their bravery and sacrifices - neither the Indians nor the British. More than a million Indian soldiers in World War I and more than two million in World War II fought for the empire. The question is whether the time has come to look back upon history and commemorate these Indians, if not for anything else then at least for their bravery, as they were caught on the wrong side of India's freedom movement. To know the answer, join us for a debate on The Big Fight.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Last time when the BJP-led NDA government was in power there were widespread allegations against NCERT director and historians of trying to 'saffronise' school textbooks. With Narendra Modi coming to power, scholars and educationists perceived to be close to the RSS are trying to make a case of revising our textbooks and school curriculum. There is a need for an overhaul of our education system but the question is that in the name of overhauling the education system will the government try to push its agenda? Will history be now written to appease and further the agenda of the Right wing? Is that a genuine concern? Join us for a special debate of The Big Fight.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:subtitle>The Supreme Court had asked for a Uniform Civil Code almost three decades ago, but the government has remained silent on the observation. Is India prepared to have a uniform civil law? Should all the personal laws be done away with?</itunes:subtitle>
                    <itunes:summary>The Supreme Court, in its observation in the Shah Bano case, had asked for a Uniform Civil Code in India. Almost three decades have passed but in spite of repeated observation and earnest instruction by the Top Court in other cases, the government of the day has chosen to remain a mute spectator in framing or at least having a discussion with various stakeholders in building up a consensus on the need for a uniform civil code. Recently, after the court declared fatwas and Sharia courts as illegal, Union Minister of Law had expressed the government's desire to have a uniform civil law in the country. The moot point is whether India is prepared to have a uniform civil law. Should all the personal laws be done away with? Instead of being imposed is consultation and consensus the only way to get the law through? To know all about this contentious issue join us for a special edition of The Big Fight.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>After the election results, this was the most awaited event for the Modi government - what will be there in the Budget? Will the government take some bold steps? Will it do away with subsidies? Though Arun Jaitley, the Finance Minister, did not offer any big bang reform yet, the Budget laid down India's map for the future - infrastructure has to improve, prices of essential food items has to be controlled, tax officials hounding entrepreneurs needs to stop, that social sector lending and schemes will continue for the benefit of those who cannot help themselves; renewed fillip will be on Small &amp; Medium Scale Enterprises, entrepreneurship is to be encouraged and last but not the least bureaucratic complexities have to be simplified. If this is what the Finance Minister has said then what is there to worry about? Apparently and in theory, nothing, except for the fact that without implementation none of these schemes or plans are going to bear any fruit. For 'acche din' implementing all these schemes and plans in letter and theory is going to be the real challenge. Join us for a special edition of The Big Fight.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>The outrageous comment by Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Pal has brought to light how politicians are getting away with making crass comments against women. In a video, the TMC MP was seen issuing threats of sending his men to rape women if anyone harmed his party workers. The incident also brought into the fore a disturbing fact that police or law enforcement agencies are unwilling to take action against leaders from ruling parties. But Tapas Pal is not alone. In the past, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, CPIM's Anisur Rehman have all passed such insensitive comments. So how do we prevent our netas from making such insensitive comments or issuing threats? Should filing of FIRs be made mandatory? Or should the change come from within the political establishment? We debate on The Big Fight.</itunes:summary>
