                    <description>LARRY SPARKS is a dedicated leader for bluegrass music and has been called The King of Bluegrass Soul. Larry began his career in the mid-1960s as a guitarist with the Stanley Brothers and later became lead vocalist for Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys.

                    <description>AMY RAY is the Decatur, Georgia songwriter best known as half of the Grammy-winning Indigo Girls folk-rock duo. Amy has always been a a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll but her upcoming solo release 'Goodnight Tender', on Ray's own Decatur-based imprint, will be a career first for her -- a pure country music album. The songs were written over more than a decade and she sings movingly about dogs, pills, Duane Allman and heartache.  Amy will appearing on WoodSongs with her country band. 

JOHN FULLBRIGHT was born in Bearden, Oklahoma and went to school in nearby Okemah, also the hometown of Woody Guthrie. It was at the annual Woody Guthrie Folk Festival that John first started to make a name for himself in the picking circles on the festival campgrounds. In 2009, John burst upon the southwest music scene with a stellar live and started to earn comparisons to great songwriters like Townes Van Zandt and Randy Newman. His debut album two years ago earned the Oklahoma native a Grammy nomination for 'Best Americana Album'. He just released his follow up LP titled 'Songs'.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 754: Celebration of the Music and Life of Pete Seeger featuring Rik Palieri, Rick Nestler, Mark Dvorak, Chris Walz, and Frank Hamilton</title>
                    <description>PETE SEEGER was a folk icon and musical hero to many including Michael Johnathon. Pete was Michael's neighbor and later would inspire him to become a folksinger. Pete's public TV show Rainbow Quest were the seeds on what became WoodSongs. Read Michael full's thoughts on Pete here.

http://woodsongs.blogspot.com/2014/02/pete.html

For this special broadcast of WoodSongs, Michael will be celebrating the life and music of Pete with a few close friends and artists.

RIK PALIERI is a folksinger from Vermont. When he was fifteen, he taught myself the 5-string banjo from Pete Seeger's book. In the mid 70's he joined up with Pete Seeger and The Hudson River Sloop Singers and became a regular performer at Clearwater events. Back then, The Sloop Singers were a small rag tag army of singing environmentalists that often shared the stage with Pete Seeger. Rik's latest project is following the footsteps of the legendary &amp;ldquo;The Almanac Singers” made up of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Lee Hays &amp; Mill Lampell. Rik and George Mann traveled down the road from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles, up the west coast and then from Seattle to Buffalo, singing at some of the same places and towns, and inviting local musicians to join in, as the legendary &amp;ldquo;The Almanac Singers” did in the summer of 1941. Rik will be performing with Rick Nestler who is  a musician, ships captain, songwriter, and actor.

FRANK HAMILTON toured with the Pete in the Weavers in the early 1960s. He is co-founder of the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, IL.

MARK DVORAK is a folk singer, songwriter, teacher and touring musician. His roots are in Chicago, but for more than 25 years he has been traveling the country and Europe. Since 1998, Mark has toured and performed with WeaverMania! playing the role of Pete Seeger. WeaverMa-nia! celebrates the sounds and songs of Pete's legendary folk group, The Weavers. Starting in March, he is conducting a new class "Pete Seeger &amp; The Power of Song" at the Old Town School of Folk Music where Mark has taught since 1986.  Mark is also known for conducting community sings and jams in the Pete Seeger style.

CHRIS WALZ spent three and a half years touring the world with the bluegrass band The Special Consensus. He has been at the Old Town School of Folk Music since 1996 and divides his time between performing and teaching. Chris performs with Mark in WeanerMania!</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 753: Donna the Buffalo and Eliza Rickman</title>
                    <description>DONNA THE BUFFALO's feel-good, groove-oriented, danceable and often socially conscious music all began over twenty years ago with roots in old time fiddle music that evolved into a soulful electric Americana mix infused with elements of cajun/ zydeco, rock, folk, reggae, and country. Donna the Buffalo is known for touring the country remaining fiercely independent as one of the industry’s most diverse roots-music bands and has "earned a reputation as one of the most respected, eclectic and hardest-working acts today," praises Encore. The band just released their 10th studio album 'Tonight, Tomorrow and Yesterday' [Sugar Hill Records].

ELIZA RICKMAN's presence on stage—whether she wears flowers in her hair, or stuffed birds; whether she plays a toy piano or a grand piano—is an enveloping, soft darkness, impossible to ignore. It is quite a surprise that Rickman didn’t even realize she could sing until after she earned a degree in orchestration from Azusa Pacific University, because her voice is the most enthralling and salient feature of any on the tracks from her new album ‘O, You Sinners’. And this is saying something, considering her deftness as a pianist and her subtlety as a composer. Fans of Kate Bush, PJ Harvey, Joanna Newsom, St. Vincent, and Andrew Bird will not want to miss her unique per-formance.</description>

Freddy is a wacky, one-man, guitar-playing, wise-cracking, original song-singing folk superstar best known for his hits &amp;ldquo;Who Offed Hoffa?” "My Load Shifted,” and his feel-good sing-along &amp;ldquo;The Prozac Polka (La-La Song)” all from his self titled album. He specializes in impressions of people you probably don’t recognize, plus zany late-night commercials, hilarious turns of poetry, and whatever else his fevered imagination can come up with.

Raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, she is the former lead singer of Ethel and The Shameless Hussies. This madcap redhead now based in Nashville sees the world at large with laser perception and a funny tilt.

                    <description>AJ CROCE is the son of legendary singer-songwriter Jim Croce, began his career at age 18 opening for B.B. King and has since spanned genres from jazz to Americana to blues to pop. Croce has written with artists including Willie Nelson, Arlo Guthrie, Ben Harper and Steve Poltz and headlined festivals and shared the stage with artists including Ray Charles, James Brown, Lyle Lovett, and Rod Stewart. Croce's most ambitious recording project to date entitled 'Twelve Tales' released via Compass Records. The album's 12 songs were recorded with six illustrious producers over the course of a year, including some of Cowboy Jack Clement's final sessions before he passed last August and a co-written song with Leon Russell.

THE GRAHAMS are the creative union of lifelong romantic partners Alyssa and Doug Graham. The duo combines soulful bluegrass with hints of earthy Americana, adding colors from traditional folk and country blues, into an infectious blend of storytelling that results in songs of love, loss, yearning, and the view from rural American roads less traveled. The new album, 'Riverman’s Daughter', was produced by Grammy-winning producer Malcolm Burn and is the winning culmination of The Grahams’ long journey into the heart of America, the inspiration they derived from immersion into classic American music, and the natural and honest talent they have for bringing forth a modern musical idiom steeped in tradition.

                    <description>WILLIE SUGARCAPPS collective musical experiences mingle together to create a new kind of organic and artisanal music. Born out of a music gathering in lower Alabama, Grayson Capps, Corky Hughes, Will Kimbrough and the duo Sugarcane Jane (featuring Savana Lee and Anthony Crawford)—led to the birth of the band. The band's Self-Titled debut is laid back, it rocks, it comes from classic country, from the blues, from New Orleans and from the best kind of rock 'n' roll. It tells a story through five individual voices full of character and experience with humanity, energy and soul.

BASKERY is a trio of sisters from Sweeden that's all about turning the music on its head, blending the straightforwardness of punk with the subtlety of singer/songwriting. The music is not to be confused with country or bluegrass just because the instrumentation involves a double bass, a six string banjo and acoustic guitar. In their late teens the sisters joined forces with their dad, who had been a one man band as long as the girls can recall it, playing old blues and country tunes for a living. This foundation of classic "roots music and Americana" settled in their hearts, but also awoke the urge of breaking the rules of traditional music. The band's latest is 'Little Wild Life'.

                    <description>DAVID BROZA is an Israeli superstar that has been considered one of the most dynamic and vibrant performers in the singer/songwriter world. His charismatic and energetic performances have brought to worldwide audiences, a fusion of the three different countries in which he was raised: Israel, Spain, and England, filling concert halls with his famous guitar playing, ranging from flamenco flavored rhythmic and percussion techniques, to whirlwind finger picking, to a signature rock and roll sound. More than a singer/songwriter, David is also well known for his commitment and dedication to several humanitarian causes, predominantly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. David recorded his new album 'East Jerusalem / West Jerusalem' with Palestinian and Israeli musicians in East Jerusalem, the Palestinian part of that holy city. The album was produced by multiple Grammy nominee Steve Earle and features performances by Earle and Wyclef Jean.

MIKE STEVENS and OKAIDJA AFROSO are two passionate musicians from very different backgrounds. Mike is an award winning harmonica virtuoso from Canada and Okaidja is a a traditional master musician and dancer from Ghana. The two bring their talents together on the stunning album 'CanadAfrica'.  Here you will encounter the
essence of Ghana’s Gold Coast intertwined with the deep roots of Folk and Blues music of North America. This innovative record reveals how beautifully the sounds of the harmonica complements Ghanaian melodies powered by these two master musicians. The last time Mike appeared on WoodSongs, he and Raymond McLain brought the house down with their version of the "Orange Blossom Special". It stands as one of the all time great performance on the show. Raymond will be making a special guest appearance on the broadcast with Mike and Okaidja so put on your seat belts!

MICHAEL MARTIN MURPHEY has been called "one of the best songwriters in America." Murphey has left an indelible mark on the American Music Landscape crafting and recording such iconic hits as "Wildfire," "Carolina In The Pines", "Geronimo's Cadillac", "Cowboy Logic," "Cherokee Fiddle", "Boy From The Country" and more. In the process, he earned six gold albums and multiple Grammy nominations. His latest release is the bluegrass flavored album 'Red River Drifter'.  michaelmartinmurphey.com

THE CLARK FAMILY TRIO are from Searcy, Arkansas and perform modern Bluegrass, Americana and Gospel favorites, featuring tight three-part "family" harmonies and finger-style and flat picked acoustic guitar. Nine-year-old Sally Ann Clark and her big sister, 15-year old Sophie, have literally grown up singing with their Mom, Cindy (who also plays upright bass for the group) and are joined by Little Rock superpicker Bill Nesbitt on acoustic guitar.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>Michael Johnathon and the WoodSongs Crew head to Eureka Springs, Arkansas for the first show of a double broadcast taping at as part of the 66th Annual Ozark Folk Festival.

LEROY TROY AND THE TENNESSEE MAFIA JUG BAND are a "blast from the past" band. They are five guys and a scrubboard, with roots like wisdom teeth anchored by Leroy Troy, "The Tennessee Slicker," who has performed his astounding old time banjo act since the 1980's and was a featured player on hit TV show Hee Haw. Their latest CD is 'Barnyard Frolic'. tennesseemafiajugband.com

CLANCEY FERGUSON has been hailed as "Princess of Bluegrass". This 15 year old fiddler from Mountain View, Arkansas is the 2012 Arkansas State Junior Fiddle Champion the and 2013 Arkansas Junior Contemporary Fiddle Champion. Despite her tender age, Clancey has amassed and impressive list of appearances including playing on stage with Rhonda Vincent on numerous occasions and interviewed by Chelsea Clinton for NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams.

THE OZARK ALLIANCE is a family band from Salem, Missouri, (home of The Dillards). Alex, Jenny, Allison, Robin, &amp; Dennis Vaughn have been playing together as a band since 2002 - with the exception of Allison, who was only born in 2004. The band specializes in traditional and modern bluegrass and bluegrass-gospel music performed around a single mic. In fact, they won 1st place in the National Single Mic Championship at Silver Dollar City in 2008. 

MOUNTAIN SPROUT is a highly energetic hillbilly music machine, spitting original tunes and blowing minds with whitty lyrics and face melting musicianship. Hailing from Eureka Springs, Arkansas, four incredible musicians work seamlessly to bring forward the kind of bass thumping, banjo picking, guitar playing, fiddle shredding, that makes you get and stomp your feet.  

DAVID KIMBROUGH III is a genuine bluesman living in Northwest Arkansas. He began his career singing alongside his father the great "Junior" Kimbrough. David has recently added the mountain dulcimer to his presentation of original, Delta, North Mississippi Hill Country and Cotton Patch Blues.

ALLISON WILLIAMS is a native of the Arkansas Ozarks and plays old-time clawhammer banjo in a modern context. Allison got her start as a punk rock musician before rediscovering her musical roots. Several years in the mountains of North Carolina educated her in Appalachian banjo techniques, especially the fast, distinctive styles of Hobart Smith and Wade Ward. Since releasing her solo CD 'Give Me Roses', she has toured internationally, playing to a sold-out Barbican Hall in London, as part of the BBC's "Folk America" special, and backing folk legend Michelle Shocked on her 2010 East Coast tour. She makes her home again in the Ozark mountains.</description>

                    <description>TIM O'BRIEN &amp; DARRELL SCOTT are roots-music titans. The highly regarded writer/singer/multi-instrumentalists have conducted their parallel careers as solo artists and sidemen, cutting similarly wide swaths across the roots-music land-scape.They’ve continued to release solo albums while leading their own bands and lending their talents to world-class musical aggregations — notably including O’Brien’s stint in Mark Knopfler’s touring unit and Scott’s foray with Robert Plant’s Band of Joy — as well as having their songs covered by the likes of the Dixie Chicks, Dierks Bentley, Nickel Creek, Kathy Mattea, Faith Hill, Guy Clark, Sam Bush, Brad Paisley, Sara Evans, Garth Brooks, Patty Loveless, Trace Adkins and Tim McGraw. The two have just released 'Memories and Moments'. It's their long awaited studio follow-up to the 2000 release 'Real Time'. timanddarrell.com

RON BLOCK has long since secured his reputation as a deeply thoughtful and accomplished musician. After two-decades as part of Alison Krauss’ band, Union Station, with whom he’s earned a collection of Grammy&amp;reg;, IBMA, and Dove awards, as well as many years as a songwriter and sideman for the likes of Rhonda Vincent, Randy Travis, The Boxcars, The Cox Family, Dailey &amp; Vincent, Dolly Parton, and Vince Gill, Block now presents his third solo album, ‘Walking Song.’ This collection of songs contains the richest range of sentiments that Block has ever taken up, from the ultimate longings of the soul to the joy and wonder of being alive. Ron will be be performing on WoodSongs with bluegrass phenom Sierra Hull. ronblock.com</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 731: The Jake Leg Stompers and Bassekou Kouyate</title>
                    <description>THE JAKE LEG STOMPERS evoke the rebellious spirit and colorful pageantry of American popular music before the Second World War, from the Memphis blues to the Virginia Reel; when jazz began, vaudeville was urgent, and folk music was still dangerous. From their world headquarters in Bucksnort, Tennessee, the band serve up tangy tastes of chicken-fried, pre-war, hokum-billy jug music to gourmet audiences everywhere. The band's latest release is 'Up to No Good'.

BASSEKOU KOUYATE is a virtuoso picker, musical visionary and Africa’s greatest in-strumentalist whose work blurs the lines between West African and American roots music. Bassekou’s instrument, the ngoni, is an ancient traditional &amp;ldquo;spike lute” and an ancestor of the banjo, sharing its taut-skinned drum body, percussive attack, and varied picking techniques. Since 2005, Bassekou has led Ngoni Ba, the first-ever group built around not one but four ngoni‘s. Bassekou Kouyate is celebrating the release of his album ‚Jama ko‘.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 730: The Makem &amp; Spain Brothers and Runa</title>
                    <description>THE MAKEM &amp; SPAIN BROTHERS are song collectors in the spirit of their forefathers preserving old folk songs and introducing a new generation to this rich musical history. The Makem's continue the lineage of one of Irish music's dynasties, begun by their grandmother Sarah Makem and father Tommy Makem, who is now considered an icon. The Spain Brothers learned Irish songs at their father's knee. This band of brothers have honed their craft over nearly two decades of international performances and are now a road-tested Irish vocal group. A host of various instruments and five male vocals, using precise three-part harmonies blend perfectly for what many describe as a wall of sound. 
   
RUNA draws on the diverse musical backgrounds of its band members and offers a contemporary and refreshing approach to traditional and more recently composed Celtic material. This award winning ensemble includes members that hail from Philadelphia, Dublin, Canada and Louisville, KY and have played with Solas, Riverdance, Slide, Clannad, Fiddlers' Bid, Moya Brennan, Eileen Ivers, Hazel O'Conner, Full Frontal Folk, Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty, Barcó, Téada, and the Guy Mendilow Band. The band won recently won an Independent Music Awards for Best Song in World/Traditional Category. The band recently released their third album, 'Somewhere Along the Road'.</description>

                    <description>THE ANNIE MOSES BAND has wowed audiences performing their unique roots music that blossoms into a baroque-pop sound flavored with a shot of classical fervor and dy-namic string instrumentation. Named after their great grandmother who prioritized mu-sical education for her children, even in poverty stricken times, The Annie Moses Band is comprised of 9 members of the Wolaver family, several who are Julliard alumni. The band has just released their latest album 'Pilgrims and Prodigals'. It's a sophisticated, complex blending of classical, jazz, folk, bluegrass and even a frisson of Celtic thrown in for good measure.

JOE MULLINS &amp; THE RADIO RAMBLERS are one of the hottest music acts in the Midwest. They are the 2012 IBMA Emerging Artist of the Year. The band is collaboration of veteran Bluegrass musicians who have worked with one another during former musical endeavors, in the Ohio Valley. They are fronted by Joe Mullins, a banjo player and AM radio station owner that has earned 5 IBMA awards and 3 SPBGM awards over the past two decade.</description>

                    <description>THE BARN BIRDS are a collaboration between veteran North Carolina Americana songsmith/guitarist Jonathan Byrd and Northwest singer/fiddler/guitarist Chris Kokesh, known for her work with Misty River. Jonathan and Chris Kokesh met in 2007 and dubbed themselves the Barn Birds when they made their first recordings together. The duo's self titled album is an album about romantic love expressed with sophisticated musicality, smart songs and great sound. Byrd and Kokesh include songs written with and by Amy Speace, Anthony da Costa, Carey West, Corin Raymond, Anais Mitchell, Rob Vaarmeyer, Luke Dick, and the late Jack Hardy.

MELISSA FERRICK signed to Atlantic Records in the mid-‘90s. Ferrick was part of a new wave of alt-rock females—including artists like Liz Phair, PJ Harvey and college-mate Paula Cole—who sang about womanhood with sharp, unchecked honesty. Morrissey proved an early champion when he personally invited her to tour as his opening act, and Ferrick eventually went on to found her own label and release a string of albums and EPs (more than 16 to date) in which she played almost every instrument herself. She tours regularly and plays to packed houses across the U.S. Her latest is 'the truth is' on MPress Records.</description>

                    <description>MANDOLIN ORANGE is Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz, a duo that makes hushed, intricate, timeless music from the North Carolina Triangle region, drawing on deep American musical traditions to tell moving 21st century stories. The band has toured with Kathleen Edwards, Abigail Washburn, and Rosanne Cash, who says of their music, "Love it - it has the plainspoken, mournful power of bluegrass and the elegance and intricacy of American classical, like Copland or Barber." They are make their Yep Roc debut with ‘This Side of Jordan'.

JESSE DEE is a singing, songwriting, guitar-playing soul man-a modern day trailblazer inspired by the old school. Based out of Boston, his warm and honest sound, his instantly memorable melodies and positive, slice-of-life lyrics (evoking the heyday of the Brill Building songwriters), Jesse expertly updates soul music for contemporary audiences. Dee's Alligator Records label debut is 'On My Mind / In My Heart'.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 726: Tribute to Dr. Ralph Stanley featuring Don Rigsby, Nathan Stanley and The Clinch Mountain Boys</title>
                    <description>Tribute to Dr. Ralph Stanley featuring Don Rigsby, Nathan Stanley and The Clinch Mountain Boys 

ABOUT DR. RALPH STANLEY Dr. Stanley is the legendary icon, that for over 6 decades, has become one of the most influential artists of all time. In 1946, along with his older brother Carter Stanley, they formed the legendary Stanley Brothers duo. The Stanley Brothers and the Clinch Mountain Boys became one of the most popular brother acts in Country Music history. After Carter’s death, Stanley shifted the band’s musical emphasis from hard-driving bluegrass to an older, sadder, less adorned mountain style. In 2002, Stanley received his first ever Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance of the haunting rendition of &amp;ldquo;Oh Death” that was featured in the movie and soundtrack of &amp;ldquo;O Brother Where Art Thou”. 

DON RIGSBY has remained true to his mountain roots and made his own marks as a powerful tenor and distinctive mandolin player. He has a life-long passion for the music of Dr. Ralph Stanley. His latest release, 'Doctor’s Orders: A Tribute to Ralph Stanley', are all songs Stanley recorded throughout his 67-year (and counting) career. Some are rare gems the Old Master seldom or never performed in his stage shows. Don is a two-time Grammy nominee and two-time winner of the SPBGMA’s Traditional Male Vocalist of the Year awards. 

NATHAN STANLEY is the grandson of Dr. Ralph Stanley, Nathan has been called the "Prince Of Bluegrass" and an heir to the Stanley Music Royalty. His new album, 'The Legacy Continues', salutes his bluegrass forebears and introduces some newer tunes that have all the earmarks of enduring including the heartfelt self penned song "Papaw, I Love you". 

THE CLINCH MOUNTAIN BOYS has been the name of Dr. Stanley touring band since he and his brother started performing together as The Stanley Brothers in 1946. The band has produced some of Country and Bluegrass music’s biggest stars including Ricky Skaggs, Larry Sparks and the late Keith Whitley. The Clinch Mountain Boys will be the backup band for both Nathan and Don for this historic WoodSongs broadcast</description>

                    <description>CRYSTAL BOWERSOX catapulted from the coffeehouses and subway tunnels of Chi-cago to millions of homes across America when she placed second in Season 9 of American Idol by her emotive folk-rock-country style. Old soul voice, care-free style and "don't mess with me" attitude set her apart from the other contestants and landed the self-taught songstress performances with the like Joe Cocker, Harry Connick, Jr., and Alanis Morrissette. Her latest is 'All That For This' .
  
MARIA DOYLE KENNEDY gained international acclaim for her roles on esteemed films and television series like Dexter, Downtown Abbey, and The Tudors. From Ireland, her fifth solo release 'Sing', is a 10-song collection co-written with husband Kieran Kennedy, featuring duets with Damien Rice, Paul Brady and, on 'Yes We Will', the legendary John Prine.  Richly imagined, 'Sing' marries folk forms with torch-song melodies, flamenco rhythms, avant-rock, Celtic, Mediterranean and Appalachian airs.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 724: Over the Rhine and Courtney Jaye</title>
                    <description>OVER THE RHINE is the southern Ohio-based husband-and-wife team of multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Linford Detweiler and vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Karin Bergquist. The acclaimed folk/Americana duo return to the WoodSongs with a brand new double album titled 'Meet Me At The Edge Of The World'. The songs were all recorded live and were inspired by the couple’s move to a pre-Civil War farm in southern Ohio eight years ago. The album was produced by Grammy-winning producer Joe Henry.

COURTNEY JAYE is a Nashville based singer/songwriter whose angelic, high plains vocal and its steady reverb wash fits in well with other female alt-country artists like Neko Case and Jenny Lewis. Her latest LP, 'Love and Forgiveness' is an organic and rootsy album that recalls the classic 70s-inspired pop of her heroes Neil Young, Linda Ronstadt, The Band and Fleetwood Mac.</description>

                    <description>TOMMY MALONE has enjoyed a successful career as the guitarist, singer for the leg-endary SUBDUDES for over two decades. A musician’s musician, he has recorded with Rosanne Cash, Shawn Colvin and Anders Osborne, and has impacted markets with hit other projects including Tiny Town and the Continental Drifters. His songs have been recorded by Joe Cocker, The Radiators, Tab Benoit and many others, but it’s his ability to perform his own stories and turn them into vivid musical images that sets him apart from other performers. His first solo record in 12 years 'Natural Born Days' tracks one man’s journey through life, suffering through hard times from hurricanes to heartbreak but al-ways finding a way to keep on keeping on. 

HEY MARSEILLES [pronounced: hay mar-say ] is the critically acclaimed orchestral pop sextet from Seattle. The band produces a lush wall of orchestral sound using cello, viola, trumpet, accordion, clarinets, piano, guitar and drums around Matt Bishop's memorable melodies and honest lyricism. Their unique orchestral chamber pop (or 'folkestra' as the band likes to say) has become the group’s signature sound. The band has just released their sophomore album 'Lines We Trace'. It represents a band steady enough in its sound, that it can expand beyond it.</description>

                    <description>NIKKI HILL hails from Durham, North Carolina. She draws on vintage female rhythm and blues influences such as LaVern Baker, Etta James and Ruth Brown, as well as some of her favorite male singers Otis Redding and Solomon Burke, without being stuck or pi-geonholed strictly as a ‘retro’ artist. Her tough vocal style fits with contemporary sensi-bilities yet evokes all the great blues shouters of previous decades. With the success of similar artists such as Amy Winehouse or Imelda May, Hill is poised to blaze her own trail in their wake. Her upcoming release is ‘Here’s Nikki Hill‘! 

RICK ESTRIN ranks among the very best harp players, singers and songwriters in the blues world. His work on the reeds is deep in the tradition of harmonica masters Sonny Boy Williamson II and Little Walter Jacobs, while at the same time pushing that tradition forward. Rick was awarded the Blues Foundation's prestigious Blues Music Award for Best Harmonica Player at the 34th annual BMA. He will be performing with his band The Nightcats. His latest is 'One Wrong Turn' on Alligator Records.</description>

                    <description>THE CLEVERLYS are one of the most outrageous bands that we've ever come across. This "family" band comes from the remote part of the Ozark Mountains, near Cane Spur, Arkansas. Their twisted sense of humor and stellar musicianship rocked this year's CMA Fest and their YouTube downloads have topped over a million. They have an incredible "backstory" and a timeless bluegrass sound. What makes the band unusual is their choice of material. They cover The Black Eyed Peas, The Bangles, and many other unexpected choices. 

MOORE BROTHERS BAND are a trio of very young brothers from western North Caro-lina made up of 15 year old Jacob (mandolin), 19 year old Daniel (bass) and 10 year old Isaac on guitar. Don’t let their youth fool you; this trio means business. Together, they weave a musical tapestry that honors tradition and welcomes progress, melding a love of tone and harmonies with a fiery stage energy that wins over even the most jaded listeners, while keeping music lovers on the edge of their seat. The latest CD project is 'Pick It Brother'.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>THE CLEVERLYS are one of the most outrageous bands that we've ever come across. This "family" band comes from the remote part of the Ozark Mountains, near Cane Spur, Arkansas. Their twisted sense of humor and stellar musicianship rocked this year's CMA Fest and their YouTube downloads have topped over a million. They have an incredible "backstory" and a timeless bluegrass sound. What makes the band unusual is their choice of material. They cover The Black Eyed Peas, The Bangles, and many other unexpected choices. 

MOORE BROTHERS BAND are a trio of very young brothers from western North Caro-lina made up of 15 year old Jacob (mandolin), 19 year old Daniel (bass) and 10 year old Isaac on guitar. Don’t let their youth fool you; this trio means business. Together, they weave a musical tapestry that honors tradition and welcomes progress, melding a love of tone and harmonies with a fiery stage energy that wins over even the most jaded listeners, while keeping music lovers on the edge of their seat. The latest CD project is 'Pick It Brother'.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>KIM CHURCHILL plays a guitar with busy fingers and the rhythm of a master, and sings lyrics that are difficult to believe they came from someone 21 years old. His style is ex-plosive, with intricate fingerpicking, percussive beats on the body of the guitar, and two-handed tapping intertwined with an earthy stomp box, powerful harmonica melodies and soulful voice.

BEN SOLLEE is known for his cello-playing that incorporates new techniques to create a unique mix of folk, bluegrass, jazz and R&amp;B. This Kentucky native possesses a knack for intricate arrangements. Sollee shares himself with his audience, whether it be by personal lyrics, or his commitment to the environment.</description>

                    <description>JANIVA MAGNESS is among the premier blues and R&amp;B singers in the world today. Her voice possesses an earthy, raw honesty and beauty born from her life experience. She received the coveted 2009 Blues Music Awards for B.B. King Entertainer Of The Year (she is only the second woman to ever win this award, Koko Taylor being the first). She returns to the WoodSongs stage with a brand new CD 'Stronger For It', where she co-wrote three remarkable, autobiographical songs for the album. 

MINTON SPARKS fuses music, poetry, and her intoxicating gift for storytelling to paint word pictures of the rural South that put you square in the middle of the people and the places?she knows like the back of her hand. She delivers words in beelines of bluesy rhythm and worries the hooks-and there are hooks-backed solely by the nimble acoustic guitar work of John Jackson, who’s perhaps best known for having played with Bob Dylan. Her latest album, 'Live at the Station Inn', captures her and Jackson performing 13 memorable story-songs in front of an audience.</description>

                    <description>JJ GREY &amp; MOFRO bring a grimy blend of front porch soul and down-home storytelling to the WoodSongs stage. Over the course of six albums and a decade of touring, he and his band Mofro have sewn a continuous thread of laying-it-on-the-line shows that move folks to dance and at times to tears. Many of Grey’s songs reflect his love for the North Florida wilderness in which he grew up. JJ's sixth studio album, 'This River'on Alligator Records was named for the St. John's River -- a centering point for his childhood near Jacksonville, Florida and features some of his strongest songwriting to date.

SLADE WARNKEN is only 15 but has incredible bluesy voice. Listen as Slade brings down the house with his version of Otis Reddings "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay".</description>

The duo has achieved sensational success by taking the cello to a new level and breaking the boundaries between different genres of music. Their unique cello version of Michael Jackson’s &amp;ldquo;Smooth Criminal” took the world by storm. Within only a week, this YouTube video became a huge viral sensation leading to a record deal with Sony Masterworks and an invitation to join Elton John on his worldwide tour. Since then, the duo has appeared on major TV shows such as GLEE, have toured with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, George Michael and Leona Lewis and released their second album IN2ITION. 2cellos.com 

SARAH MORGAN has also won multiple titles for her Appalachian dulcimer work including the 2012 National Mountain Dulcimer Championship. This native of East Tennessee is only 18 and has incorporated the rich musical heritage of the area into her music. Backing traditional Appalachian melodies and haunting old time tunes with fresh harmonies and a progressive drive, she lends a new feel to seemingly &amp;ldquo;old” tunes, while accompanying pure and heartfelt vocals with the unpretentious sound of the Appalachian dulcimer. She recently released her second album Run to the Window sarahmorganmusic.webs.com</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 709: Otis Taylor with Mato Nanji and Mary Gauthier</title>
                    <description>OTIS TAYLOR is the visionary songwriter with his powerful and unique blend of roots music and narrative poetry he labels "trance blues." On his 13th album, 'My World Is Gone', Taylor was inspired by Indigenous frontman and guitar virtuoso MATO NANJI. With Mato, Taylor embarked on a soul-searching journey into the past and present, and into the psyche, of America’s indigenous people. The result is
a lightning bolt of musical creativity and social commentary. Its songs crackle with poetic intelligence and a unique, adventurous sound that balances the modern world with echoes of ancient Africa, Appalachia and more. Mato will be performing with Otis on WoodSongs.

                    <itunes:summary>OTIS TAYLOR is the visionary songwriter with his powerful and unique blend of roots music and narrative poetry he labels "trance blues." On his 13th album, 'My World Is Gone', Taylor was inspired by Indigenous frontman and guitar virtuoso MATO NANJI. With Mato, Taylor embarked on a soul-searching journey into the past and present, and into the psyche, of America’s indigenous people. The result is
a lightning bolt of musical creativity and social commentary. Its songs crackle with poetic intelligence and a unique, adventurous sound that balances the modern world with echoes of ancient Africa, Appalachia and more. Mato will be performing with Otis on WoodSongs.

                    <description>MIKE SCOTT is the Scottish bandleader of the legendary group The Waterboys. The band has just released its first new album in half a decade 'An Appointment With Mr. Yeats' which takes classic poems of the classic Irish poet W.B. Yeats and puts them in modern musical settings. The new album connects with the power and immediacy of Waterboy's classics like This Is the Sea (1985) and Fisherman’s Blues (1988), unfolding with colorful vividness that has characterized Scott’s single-minded body of work during the course of the last three decades. Scott has been on quite a creative roll in recent years, having authored an enthusiastically received memoir, Adventures of a Waterboy, while the new album is the result of two decades of dedication and a lifelong fascination with Yeats’ poetry.</description>

                    <description>DOYLE LAWSON &amp; QUICKSILVER is celebrating his 50th anniversary in bluegrass music this year. Doyle and the boys have multiple Grammy, Dove, ICM, IBMA and SPBGMA Award nominations, and are seven-time winners of IBMA’s Vocal Group of the Year Award. Doyle Lawson &amp; Quicksilver are the reigning Inspirational Country Music Association Vocal Group of the Year, on the heels of Lawson’s induction into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame last year. We are proud to have this incredible bluegrass legend back on WoodSongs!

LAKE STREET DIVE is a quirky northeastern quartet that has become known for their irreverent brand of pop which blends classic soul and R&amp;B, jazz, and British invasion. Combine this with the unstoppable joy of their live shows and near viral collection of YouTube videos, and you get the sum of the Lake Street Dive equation: pure pop music fun. Knock-your-socks-off vocals and virtuosic instrumentals top it all off, and with the release of their third and self titled record on Signature Sounds, the band is garnering a growing fan base in and beyond their native East Coast. Check out their fun Jackson 5 cover recorded on a sidewalk.</description>

                    <description>JD CROWE is in fact one of the greatest bluegrass stars of all time. He comes to WoodSongs to help us celebrate his legacy career, amazing banjo style and his recent honors from the University of Kentucky. Crowe began playing the banjo early and was offered a job with Jimmy Martin's Sunny Mountain Boys in the mid-1950s. In the late 1960s, Crowe formed the Kentucky Mountain Boys, principally performing in the Lexington, Kentucky region. By the early 1970s, Crowe changed the band's name to The New South, widely considered one of the most influential bluegrass groups in history. Many influential musicians have been a part of the band over the years, including Keith Whitley, Ricky Skaggs, Tony Rice, Jerry Douglas, and Doyle Lawson. Part of the evening will be devoted to JD talking about his banjo style and introducing young, new players to the audience.

BRANDY MILLER is a 15 year girl from North Carolina who has won several banjo awards. JD Crowe is one of her banjo inspirations and we thought it would be fun to have her on the show to go pick-to-pick with her. Bring your own seat belts!

                    <description>WANDA JACKSON is widely known and respected as "The Queen of Rockabilly." Jackson is credited with being the first woman to ever record a rock and roll song-"Let's Have a Party" in 1958. In 2009, Jackson was inducted into the "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" and, in 2010, was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Americana Music Awards. Wanda returns to the WoodSongs Stage to celebrate the release of her 31st studio album 'Unfinished Business' produced by Justin Townes Earle on Sugar Hill Records.

SHEMEKIA COPELAND has evolved from teenage upstart to one of the most prominent voices in the blues. She's currently the most feted woman in the blues world and actually had a coronation where she was crowned and declared "Queen of the Blues" at the Chicago Blues Festival in 2011. Shemekia earned her crown with a series of high-quality recordings and an unrelenting tour schedule including a memorable performance at the White House in front of an audience that included the President of the United States, sharing the bill with Buddy Guy, Mick Jagger, Jeff Beck, B.B. King and other greats. Her latest is "33 1/3" on Telarc International.</description>

Check out their gypsy jazz version of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody."

MOLASSES CREEK's high-energy performances and phenomenal songwriting bring the love of their coastal home of Ocracoke Island, NC, to the stage. Award winners from Garrison Keillor's "Prairie Home Companion," Molasses Creek has recorded 12 albums over the past 19 years.

                    <itunes:summary>HOLLY WILLIAMS' success as a singer-songwriter is that it's never been her mission to try and live up to the legacy cast by her famous and prolific father and grandfather - Hank Jr. and Sr., respectively - nor has she spent a lot of time trying to live it down. The respect that Holly has garnered as an artist over the course of many years spent building an international fan base, and the release of two acclaimed albums, has come on her own terms, based on her own sound. She continues building her legacy with "The Highway" released on her own label and co-produced by Charlie Peacock.

CHARLIE PEACOCK's adventurous and success-laden resume makes him a difficult musician to categorize. The Grammy Award-winning, multi-format performer, songwriter and record producer has excelled in pop, gospel, country, Folk-Americana, and jazz. Alongside his own unique performing and recording career, Peacock has played a lead role in creating major hits in three separate decades-most notably Amy Grant, Switchfoot and The Civil Wars. In 2012 Peacock diverted from his recent jazz recordings to produce his own return to vocal performance, the Folk/Americana flavored "No Man's Land."</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 694: Matthew Ryan and Miss Tess &amp; The Talkbacks</title>
                    <description>MATTHEW RYAN has been celebrated for his poetic lyricism. His work challenges listeners in so many ways, always cutting to the bone with a rare honesty that isn't prone to offer easy answers. His latest 'In the Dusk of Everything' marks a distilled reclamation of his more primal Americana/Folk roots. With the bluntness of punk and the evocative rhythm of poetry his lyricism shines amongst these twelve deceptively simple songs of perseverance and closure via a clarity that operates in layers amid a world of struggle, beauty and sublime epiphany.

MISS TESS is a New York City based songwriter and performing musician, who tours regularly with her band, as "Miss Tess &amp; The Talkbacks". Inspired by styles of vintage swing, blues, country, and early rock-n-roll Miss Tess draws comparisons to artists such as Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, Peggy Lee, and Chuck Berry, but maintains a style all of her own. Miss Tess’ sixth studio album, Sweet Talk, is a collection of finely crafted original material, along with one haunting cover of the Ink Spot’s 1941 hit I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire. With songs ranging from influences deeply rooted in a rich history of American music, Tess and her band project a sound that is distinctively timeless and unique.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>MATTHEW RYAN has been celebrated for his poetic lyricism. His work challenges listeners in so many ways, always cutting to the bone with a rare honesty that isn't prone to offer easy answers. His latest 'In the Dusk of Everything' marks a distilled reclamation of his more primal Americana/Folk roots. With the bluntness of punk and the evocative rhythm of poetry his lyricism shines amongst these twelve deceptively simple songs of perseverance and closure via a clarity that operates in layers amid a world of struggle, beauty and sublime epiphany.

MISS TESS is a New York City based songwriter and performing musician, who tours regularly with her band, as "Miss Tess &amp; The Talkbacks". Inspired by styles of vintage swing, blues, country, and early rock-n-roll Miss Tess draws comparisons to artists such as Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, Peggy Lee, and Chuck Berry, but maintains a style all of her own. Miss Tess’ sixth studio album, Sweet Talk, is a collection of finely crafted original material, along with one haunting cover of the Ink Spot’s 1941 hit I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire. With songs ranging from influences deeply rooted in a rich history of American music, Tess and her band project a sound that is distinctively timeless and unique.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 692: Amber Rubarth and The Ragbirds</title>
                    <description>AMBER RUBARTH has become a fixture in New York's indie scene, named #1 Best of NYC Songwriter by Deli Magazine last year and grand prize winner of NPR's Mountain Stage New Song Contest. At 21 years old, Amber decided to quit her career as a chainsaw sculptor in Nevada in order to pursue music. She taught herself guitar, began playing open mics and recorded her songs, which soon received over 1.5 million listens on MySpace through word of mouth alone. Amber's latest is a live album 'Sessions from the 17th Ward' features Dave Eggar on cello who will be performing with her on WoodSongs.

THE RAGBIRDS are a fusion of folk rock and pop hooks over danceable world rhythms stirred with a Celtic fiddler's bow. Hailing from Ann Arbor, MI, the energy of multi-instrumentalist Erin Zindle demands attention. She is the songwriter and front woman of the band, skillfully switching between violin, mandolin, accordion, banjo and percussion, all while dancing. The release of The Ragbirds' fourth studio effort 'Travelin' Machine' is a new milestone for the band.</description>

                    <description>BILL EVANS is well-known within the bluegrass music community not only as a musician, but also as a teacher, writer and scholar. Bill will be bringing his solo show The Banjo in America to the WoodSongs Stage. Tracing the banjo from its West African roots to the New World, Evans performs musical examples from the 1700's to the present day on a variety of vintage instruments, explaining how the banjo has been at the intersection of African- and Anglo-American musical and cultural exchange for over 250 years. Bill's new CD "In Good Company" features an all-star cast of 26 musicians, including the Infamous Stringdusters, Tim O'Brien, Joy Kills Sorrow, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, David Grier, Rob Ickes, Stuart Duncan and many, many more.

KAYLA BENDER is an amazing 12 year old banjo picker from Oklahoma. She has placed in several banjo competitions and will be showcasing at both IBMA's Kids on Bluegrass and Walnut Valley Festival this year. Watch her tear it up on "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" with her banjo teacher Rob.</description>

                    <description>BEN TAYLOR's music is marked by memorable melodies, immaculate acoustic guitar playing and insightful, honest lyrics have been captivating fans since the moment he embarked on this journey ten years ago.

                    <description>CAROLINE HERRING has established herself as a lyrical and inventive songwriter and a singer whose vocals never fail to move the listener with her high trills and rich vibrato. The Mississippi native, now based in Atlanta, has been compared to Lucinda Williams, Joan Baez, and even Mozart. Although the comparisons are nice (and hold water) the truth is that she has her own signature sound that comes to full manifestation on "Camilla", hew new career-defining record on Signature Sounds. 

SHEL is comprised of four sisters ages 18-24 who are classically trained and home-schooled—the band name is an acronym for their first names. Growing up in a musical household encouraged by their father, a respected local Ft. Collins, Colorado musician, they first appeared on stage as his backing band. SHEL has been performing since 2005 and graced the stages of Lilith Fair, International Folk Alliance, Music City Roots, and South by Southwest. The self-titled effort is the group's first full-length studio album.</description>

PEARL AND THE BEARD are three voices, one cello, one guitar, one glockenspiel, one melodica, several drums, one accordion, ninety-six teeth, and one soul. The band's genre-bending and expectation-defying sound has since burst the trio out of the confines of the New York music scene opening for Ani DiFranco and Dar Willliams. The band's current release is "Killing the Darlings."</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 687: Sarah McQuaid and Pert Near Sandstone</title>
                    <description>SARAH MCQUAID is a gifted and captivating performer whose warm, haunting alto is delicately cradled by her "sparkling guitar" (Sing Out!). She is both song crafter and song collector, equally at home with traditional Irish and Appalachian folk songs, Elizabethan ballads and 1930s jazz numbers. She is also renowned for her guitar work and is the author of acclaimed The Irish DADGAD Guitar Book. Her musical output is a direct and unfolding reflection of her own eclectic background: Sarah was born in Spain, raised in Chicago, holds dual US and Irish citizenship, and currently lives in rural England. Her new album, "The Plum Tree and the Rose," represents a departure from Sarah's previous albums, which focused on her arrangements of traditional material, in that nine of its thirteen tracks are originals.

PERT NEAR SANDSTONE emerged from the same roots-based musical hotbed in Minneapolis that gave birth to Bob Dylan, The Jayhawks and Spider John Koerner. Originally formed by four friends from the same hometown, Pert Near Sandstone formed unintentionally over weekly, whiskey-fueled picking sessions in an old house in St. Paul, MN.The band rejuvenates American stringband music with raw energy; they play tightly-crafted original material that lends itself to the modern audience, as well as being stewards of the old-time and bluegrass traditions. Check out their high octane version of The Beatles "I Am The Walrus. The band's latest release is "Paradise Hop."</description>

                    <itunes:summary>SARAH MCQUAID is a gifted and captivating performer whose warm, haunting alto is delicately cradled by her "sparkling guitar" (Sing Out!). She is both song crafter and song collector, equally at home with traditional Irish and Appalachian folk songs, Elizabethan ballads and 1930s jazz numbers. She is also renowned for her guitar work and is the author of acclaimed The Irish DADGAD Guitar Book. Her musical output is a direct and unfolding reflection of her own eclectic background: Sarah was born in Spain, raised in Chicago, holds dual US and Irish citizenship, and currently lives in rural England. Her new album, "The Plum Tree and the Rose," represents a departure from Sarah's previous albums, which focused on her arrangements of traditional material, in that nine of its thirteen tracks are originals.

                    <title>Woodsongs 686: The Pines and The Trishas</title>
                    <description>THE PINES rose out of the prairies of the Midwest and are one of the most distinct and powerful indie-rock/Americana groups to hit the national scene in years. Founded by Iowa natives David Huckfelt and Benson Ramsey, the band caught the attention of acclaimed indie label Red House Records. The Pines' new album, "Dark So Gold" shows a young band that has fully arrived with a sound and song craft that stands apart on the indie music landscape.

THE TRISHAS are 4 girls from Austin. All can sing, play and write songs ... sometimes all at once. None are named Trisha. They first shared a stage in January 2009 and their intention was simply to perform a couple of songs as part of a tribute to Savannah's father, singer-songwriter Kevin Welch. With nearly two solid years' worth of buzz and confidence-building shows and opening for the likes Dwight Yoakam, Raul Malo, Rodney Crowell, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Todd Snider, the band has released their first full-length album, "High, Wide &amp; Handsome." Their musicianship, songwriting and soaring four part harmony shows a band with a sister-like tightness looking to expand their grassroots audience outside of Texas.</description>

                    <description>MICHAEL MARTIN MURPHEY's song "Wildfire" was one of the biggest pop hits of the 70's. He returns to the WoodSongs stage with a brand new bluegrass CD called 'Tall Grass &amp; Cool Water.' It's his third album in this Grammy nominated series that explores the similarities between Bluegrass and American Cowboy Music. This "singing cowboy poet", is not only the number one, best-selling singer/songwriter of American Cowboy Music, he's one of the world's most respected singer/songwriters in the Pop and Country-Western field. Michael Martin Murphey is also a recent inductee into the Traditional Country Music Hall of Fame.

THE MASTERSONS are each deft instrumentalists, and they've spent years playing in others' bands before coming together as a unit. Both the Denton, Texas-born Eleanor Whitmore and Houston-reared Chris Masterson have been musicians for as long as they can recall. Whitmore and Masterson apprenticed for years with other musicians, she with Regina Spektor, Susan Gibson, Kelly Willis, Diana Ross, Will Hoge and others, he in the bands of Jack Ingram, Son Volt, Bobby Bare Jr. and more but found themselves compelled to write and sing together. They met in 2005 and joined Steve Earle band in May of 2011. Their debut album is "Birds Fly South" on New West Records.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 684: The Wailers and Junior Toots</title>
                    <description>THE WAILERS, together with Bob Marley, have sold in excess of 250 million albums worldwide. In England alone, they've notched up over twenty chart hits, including seven Top 10 entries. Outside of their groundbreaking work with Marley, the Wailers have also played or performed with international acts like Sting, the Fugees, Stevie Wonder, Carlos Santana, and Alpha Blondy, as well as reggae legends such as Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, and Burning Spear. As the greatest living exponents of Jamaica's reggae tradition, the Wailers have completed innumerable other tours, playing to an estimated 24 million people across the globe. Yet there's a great deal more to the Wailers than reliving the past. The band, anchored by original bassist Aston "Family Man," is still going strong today. A forthcoming Wailers' album with a star studded celebrity guest artists is in the works. As well as the band's two latest tracks featuring Koolant on lead vocals. One is a future lovers' rock classic called "Shining Star," and the other a heartfelt appeal – "A Step For Mankind" – made on behalf of the World Food Program, co-starring Duane Stephenson.

JUNIOR TOOTS, son of Toots Hibbert of the Toots &amp; the Maytals, is a uniquely talented recording artist and performer whose passion for reggae is evident in his moving live performances &amp; recordings that inspire all. Born and raised in Jamaica &amp; the US, he has a genuine commitment to socially conscious lyrics and a determination to express himself sincerely from within. This passion can be felt through his deeply soulful vocal style that is reminiscent of his father. With a mixture of Reggae, Roots, Ska, &amp; Dancehall, Junior Toots reaches out to all supporters of conscious music with a message to unite &amp; uplift. His new album, "A Little Bit of Love" is his finest work so far &amp; is receiving lots of positive reviews.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 683: Martha Redbone Roots Project and Ben Miller Band</title>
                    <description>MARTHA REDBONE is a leading voice in contemporary Native American music. Her award winning work is recognized by the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian. Redbone's musical talent has caught the ears of legends and she has recorded and/or performed with Bonnie Raitt, Pete Seeger, Youssou N'Dour, George Clinton, Rita Coolidge, Randy Brecker and Nona Hendryx. Her new album "The Garden of Love - Songs of William Blake" takes the immortal words of poet William Blake, the great Romantic visionary from 18th century England, and sets them in the Appalachian Mountains, bringing her uniquely soulful voice to hollered melodies, lullabies, ancient chants and inspired hymns. The result, produced by Grammy Award-winning Nitty Gritty Dirt Band founder John McEuen and David Hoffner, is a wondrous folk, country, gospel and blues reading in which the songs feel like timeless mountain classics with lyrics that are strikingly relevant.

BEN MILLER BAND is a one-of-a kind trio that combines the frenetic energy of bluegrass, the soul of the delta blues and the haunted spirit of Appalachian mountain music. Band members Ben Miller, Scott Leeper, and Doug Dicharry create a unique and modern sound while continuing the tradition of blending together many different musical styles, which has long been a trait of their native Ozarks in Joplin, Missouri.</description>

                    <description>IRIS DEMENT is one of the most beloved and respected writers and singers in American music. After a series of jobs waitressing and typing, Dement first began composing songs at the age of 25. Honing her skills at open-mic nights, in 1988 she moved to Nashville, where she contacted producer Jim Rooney, who helped her land a record contract. Dement did not make her recording debut until 1992, when her independent label offering, "Infamous Angel," won almost universal acclaim thanks to her pure, evocative vocal style and spare, heartfelt songcraft. Her next two albums received Grammy nods. In 1999, she collaborated with country man John Prine on his album, "In Spite of Ourselves." Dement recorded four duets with Prine that earned her another Grammy nod the following year. "Sing The Delta" is her first LP of original material in 16 years and is being released on her own label Flariella Records. She will be the sole guest for this WoodSongs Special Event Broadcast.,</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 681: Adam Cohen and Lac La Belle</title>
                    <description>ADAM COHEN is the son of the legendary songwriter Leonard Cohen. All his life Adam had sought an artistic space beyond the reach of his father's looming shadow. But in January 2007, at the age of 34, Adam Cohen owned up to his legacy. His new album "Like A Man," is a "strikingly personal album" of ten intimate songs that is "truly fit to bear the family name" (Sunday Times of London) on Decca Records. Cohen had been writing these songs and poems for a number of years, but kept them hidden away. However, the birth of his son inspired a major change of heart in Cohen. This epiphany came about during a family meal: "I was sitting at the dinner table with my father to my left and my son to my right, and I realized that it was imperative that I try and make a record worthy of my father's legacy."

LAC LA BELLE is an acoustic duo from Detroit, Michigan that juxtaposes the early decades of recorded rural American music with decaying Rustbelt aesthetic. A tradition is re-imagined- or maybe just resumed- in the 'future-rustic' swirl of accordion, mandolin, banjo, ukulele, and resonator guitar. The instrumentation echos another era, but is employed for a music of now. Their soon to be released album, "Bring on the Light" boasts 12 original works and one traditional arrangement, performed with a variety of instruments from accordion to banjitar. Each song presents a melodic tale, be it an intimate anecdote, or stories on their hometown Detroit, "Bring on the Light" captures the drifting spirit of early America.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>ADAM COHEN is the son of the legendary songwriter Leonard Cohen. All his life Adam had sought an artistic space beyond the reach of his father's looming shadow. But in January 2007, at the age of 34, Adam Cohen owned up to his legacy. His new album "Like A Man," is a "strikingly personal album" of ten intimate songs that is "truly fit to bear the family name" (Sunday Times of London) on Decca Records. Cohen had been writing these songs and poems for a number of years, but kept them hidden away. However, the birth of his son inspired a major change of heart in Cohen.

                    <title>Woodsongs 680: Adrian Legg and The Dunwells</title>
                    <description>ADRIAN LEGG is one of the wizards of the acoustic guitar. Since the 1990 release of his first U.S. recording Guitars and Other Cathedrals, this English guitar music has more than lived up to the expectations stirred by an ongoing avalanche of praise from critics, fans, top guitar mags and peers alike. Joe Satriani once said, "He's simply the best acoustic guitar player I've ever heard." The genius that the Boston Globe has called "technical brilliance paired with a troubadour's tale-weaving skill" led him from 1993-96 to be voted Best Fingerstyle Guitarist four years straight and "Guitarist of the Decade" by the readers of Guitar Player magazine. His new album is "Slow Guitar." 

THE DUNWELLS are an acclaimed British folk quintet that are utterly natural. There's no more fitting description for both the music of The Dunwells as well as the story of their magical rise from the pubs of Leeds, England to an American record deal and a stunning debut album in just two short years. The group is two brothers, two cousins and totaling five best mates who simply love to sing and play music, and do so together. Striking an organic blend between acoustic and electric roots music laced by luscious vocal harmonies by all five members, their songs and sound feel both bracingly fresh while at the same time as warm and familiar as a dear longtime friend. Their debut album is "Blind Sighted Faith."</description>

                    <description>KAT EDMONSON is a buoyant singer-songwriter from Texas whose tiny stature belies a powerful voice. She makes smart, familiar pop; though steeped in vintage tradition, her style leans left of center. She's performed with Willie Nelson, opened for Smokey Robinson, toured with Boz Scaggs and Lyle Lovett, and headlined the Taichung Jazz Festival in Taiwan. She also recorded "Baby It's Cold Outside" with Lovett for his new album "Release Me." Now splitting her time between Austin and NYC, Kat is eager to release her second record, 'Way Down Low.' She hopes it will be "a launching pad to play all over the world and travel wherever I can."

SPIRIT FAMILY REUNION play homegrown American music to stomp, clap, shake and holler with. Ever since they started singing together on the street corners, farmer's markets and subway stations of New York City, their songs have rung-out in a pure and timeless way. When Spirit Family Reunion gather to sing, there is communion. Strangers and neighbors come to rejoice in the sound, and there is no divide between performer and spectator. The band's latest is "No Separation" and they will be playing at the historic Newport Folk Festival over the summer.</description>

                    <description>BALSAM RANGE is a group of five outstanding acoustic musicians and singers from Haywood County, North Carolina. All the guys in the band grew up in the rich musical heritage of the Appalachian South, surrounded by culture and heritage steeped in traditions of The Grand Ole Opry and other important influences. For their band name, they thoughtfully and respectfully adopted the name of a majestic range of mountains that surround part of their home county...where the Smokies meet the Blue Ridge. The band won the 2011 IBMA Song of the Year winner for their song "Trains I Missed" and were nominated IBMA Emerging Artist of the Year nominee in 2010 &amp; 2011. The band's latest is "Papertown."

SONNY MOORMAN is an award winning blues musician that hails from Hamilton, OH. Whether Sonny is deftly fingerpicking his Zeiler acoustic guitar, or playing sinewy slide on his Oahu lap guitar and Dobro resophonic guitar, this is classic Blues -- played and sung the way it was supposed to be. Sonny's current release is More Live as Hell - Up to My Neck in the Blues. Sonny will performing solo acoustic on WoodSongs.</description>

                    <description>LOREN &amp; MARK are Central New York acoustic guitar standout Loren Barrigar and New Zealand star Mark Mazengarb. The two were instantly aware of the musical magic that was created the first time they played guitar together, working with the great Tommy Emmanuel at Jorma Kaukonen's Fur Peace Ranch guitar camp. It is difficult to classify the genre of music Barrigar and Mazengarb perform; they simply describe it as 'fingerstyle guitar'. The music is influenced by Bluegrass, Jazz, and Country, and their style of guitar playing is largely built upon the thumb-picking techniques pioneered by guitar greats Merle Travis, Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed.

ETTA BRITT is one of the most versatile singers working out of Nashville today. Born in Lancaster, Ky., this seasoned veteran has toured the world and shared a stage or recording studio with everyone from Engelbert Humperdinck to REO Speedwagon to Waylon Jennings. In 1978, she joined Dave Rowland and Sue Powell in the country-music trio Dave &amp; Sugar. She stayed with the trio from 1979 to 1985, during which time they received CMA Vocal Group of the Year nominations five years in a row. Etta has a brand new album "Out of the Shadows" and will be joined on-stage with her husband and renowned guitarist Bob Britt who has toured with Bob Dylan and John Fogerty.</description>

Joan is a Kentucky artist who overwhelmed radio with the clarity and power of her beautiful voice. Since initially rocketing to prominence on the success of "One of Us," the indelible, chart-topping hit from her 1995 debut album "Relish," the creatively restless singer has followed an adventurous career path that even included time as the singer for the Grateful Dead. We welcome Joan back to her Kentucky home as she performs songs from her new release, BRING IT ON HOME.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>JOAN OSBORNE is a six time Grammy nominee who had a massive worldwide hit several years ago called "One of Us." Joan is a Kentucky artist who overwhelmed radio with the clarity and power of her beautiful voice. Since initially rocketing to prominence on the success of "One of Us," the indelible, chart-topping hit from her 1995 debut album "Relish," the creatively restless singer has followed an adventurous career path that even included time as the singer for the Grateful Dead. We welcome Joan back to her Kentucky home as she performs songs from her new release, BRING IT ON HOME.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 672: The Honeycutters and Granville Automatic</title>
                    <description>THE HONEYCUTTERS are, at the heart, the musical collaboration of singer/songwriter Amanda Anne Platt and Lead Guitarist/ Producer Peter James. While their sound has drawn comparisons to such artists as Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris or Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Platt and James produce a refreshingly unique blend of Americana music that is comfortingly familiar while being entirely original. This Asheville, NC band has just released their second album When Bitter Met Sweet.

GRANVILLE AUTOMATIC is Vanessa Olivarez and Elizabeth Elkins. This Nashville-based alt country duo write songs pulled from a shared love of history, horses and war. Granville Automatic is named after a 19th-century typewriter: Vanessa is a collector. With sonic references like Lyle Lovett, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris and Willie Nelson, Granville Automatic has created a quiet and lyrical sound devoted to telling stories from the past. Both girls have a history in the music business: Vocalist/songwriter Olivarez wrote and recorded a Top 10 single in Canada, has three cuts on Sugarland records, including a song on their multi-platinum Enjoy the Ride album, and received a Dora nomination for her work in the Toronto production of Hairspray. She was also a finalist on the second season of American Idol. Guitarist/songwriter Elkins is a Grand Prize winner of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest who has showcased at the Billboard/BMI Acoustic Brunch at SXSW, at BMI showcases in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Nashville, and at CMJ. The band's self-titled debut studio album was just released.</description>

                    <description>MARTY RAYBON has been called one of the greatest singers in music. Marty's signature country soulful vocals with Shenandoah were developed many years ago when he performed Bluegrass and Gospel music with his family.Throughout his epic journey, spanning nearly three decades, Marty has produced a remarkable list of career accomplishments including; multiple number one singles, top selling albums, CMA, ACM, IBMA, and Grammy Awards, along with scores of other accolades. Collectively, his contributions to the recording industry have sold well into the millions and he has performed literally thousands of live concerts at four corners of the earth. Marty has just released two new albums, Hand to Plow &amp; Southern Roots &amp; Branches, this year on Rural Rhythm Records.

CHARLIE McCOY and his world class harmonica work has been a mainstay in Music City since the '60s. Charlie has played on dozens of hit records, including work for such legends as Elvis Presley, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and many more. But the work that has distinguished this harmonica ace is contained on more than two dozen albums that Charlie has released over the past 3 decades. In 2009, Charlie was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Charlie latest is Lonesome Whistle: A Tribute to Hank Williams.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 670: Alejandro Escovedo and Joseph Arthur</title>
                    <description>ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO returns to the WoodSongs stage with a brand new album 'Big Station' on Fantasy/Concord. Long one of America's most admired poet-rockers, his 35 years as a musician and two decades as a solo artist has taken him from Texas to California to New York and back again to Texas, encompassing a breadth of music as varied as the many bands he was part of before embarking on a solo career. The new album finds the ever-evolving Texas rocker highly-charged with spirit and purpose. Largely co-written with frequent collaborator Chuck Prophet, the album's 12 songs bristle with tension and hope as Escovedo fights to keep faith in a changing world and hold onto love.

JOSEPH ARTHUR was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-'90s, and signed to Gabriel's Real World label as the first North American artist on the label's roster. This Akron, Ohio-bred/Brooklyn, N.Y.-residing singer/songwriter's 1997 debut, 'Big City Secrets,' attracted a substantial following abroad. The artist didn't connect with Stateside listeners until 'Come To Where I'm From,' which features his signature song, "In the Sun." That track was covered by R.E.M.'s Stipe and Coldplay's Chris Martin in 2006 on a charity single to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina, having previously been recorded a decade earlier by Gabriel for a Princess Diana tribute album. Arthur is also an accomplished painter, having displayed his works in galleries around the world. His latest is a double album titled 'Redemption City' released on his own label.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 668: Celebration of the Ukulele featuring: Victoria Vox, Cathy Fink &amp; Marcy Marxer, and The Love Leighs</title>
                    <description>VICTORIA VOX and her ukulele return to the WoodSongs Stage with a brand new CD. Known as a pioneer for singer/songwriters in the growing ukulele genre, Victoria Vox has been writing and performing songs across the country in her eclectic, upbeat and clever way. Refreshingly modern and innovative, the award-winning vocalist and songwriter lives in Baltimore, and tours 130+ shows a year. The new album, 'Vox Ukulele Cello,' features Katie Chambers on cello who will accompany Victoria on WoodSongs.
Website for Victoria Vox.

CATHY FINK &amp; MARCY MARXER are a formidable powerhouse of sound, with a repertoire of traditional and contemporary folk, old-time country and swing music. They've earned two Grammy Awards and have worked with the likes of Tom Paxton, Si Kahn, Riders in the Sky, Pete Seeger, Brave Combo, Mariachi Los Camperos, Mike Seeger, Patsy Montana, Pete Kennedy and Ysaye Barnwel. "ROCKIN THE UKE" is the very first Uke-centric CD and explores their versatility on the ukulele as they travel through blues, swing, old time county, folk and original songs - all in virtuoso style.
Website for Cathy Fink &amp; Marcy Marxer.

THE LOVE LEIGHS hail from Austin, TX and combines ukuleles, guitar, a dash of clarinet; lots of harmonies, some twang, and more than a little sass. The band creates original songs in the tradition of 20th Century American acoustic music--a mix of jazz, blues, twang, and the occasional funky tune or Motown groove. Their latest Is 'All Your Talk of Love."

THE LOVE LEIGHS hail from Austin, TX and combines ukuleles, guitar, a dash of clarinet; lots of harmonies, some twang, and more than a little sass. The band creates original songs in the tradition of 20th Century American acoustic music--a mix of jazz, blues, twang, and the occasional funky tune or Motown groove. Their latest Is 'All Your Talk of Love."

Born in 1958, the son of famed blues harmonica player Carey Bell, Lurrie picked up his father's guitar at age of five and taught himself to play.In addition, he grew up with many of the Chicago blues legends around him. Eddie Taylor, Big Walter Horton, Eddie C. Campbell, Eddie Clearwater, Lovie Lee, Sunnyland Slim, Jimmy Dawkins and many more were frequent visitors to his house. They all helped to shape and school him in the blues, but none as much as his father's long-time employer Muddy Waters. By seventeen Lurrie Bell was playing on stage with Willie Dixon and soon formed The Sons of Blues band and toured with Koko Taylor. 'The Devil Ain't Got No Music,' is Lurrie's latest. It's a collection of acoustic blues and gospel songs that recollect the music he often played with his dad and at church in Mississippi and Alabama as a child.

LISA BIALES is a soulful songstress, performer, and recording artist who weaves a tapestry of Americana, jazz and blues inspired folk.

Lisa also makes her film debut this year in Academy Award-winning director Francis Ford Coppola's new film,Twixt.</description>

                    <description>MARK O’CONNOR returns with a brand new album and fiddle method book to play and give the WoodSongs audience a global violin lesson. Mark is the prominent American classical and multi genre violinist and composer. A product of America's rich aural folk tradition as well as classical music, he has melded and shaped his early influences into a new American Classical music, and a vision of an entirely American school of string playing. He has sold over two-million CDs as a solo recording. His collaboration with Yo-Yo Ma and Edgar Meyer received a Grammy Award in February 2001. The O'Connor Violin Method has been widely praised since its debut in fall 2009 as "an American grown rival to the Suzuki method" (The New Yorker). It includes great folk songs, fiddle tunes and classic themes culled from 400 years of traditional American violin playing. It pulls from all regions of North America and from diverse musical styles including classical, folk, Latin, jazz, rock and ragtime. ‘American Classics,' is a collection of new recordings arranged for violin and piano and performed by O'Connor and pianist Rieko Aizawa. The album features the repertoire on Mark’s new Method Book III. Mark will be performing with pianist Melissa Tong and serveral of the students from Lexington’s Carwile String Studio for a global violin workshop and lesson.</description>

                    <description>ANAIS MITCHELL writes songs from her 200-year-old farmhouse in rural Vermont. This daughter of "hippie back-to-the-landers" whose father was a novelist and English professor, remembers her family's home containing "a library full of novels, and lots of old folk and psychedelic rock albums. All of these influences come together in 'Hadestown,' an epic "folk opera." It's a modern retelling of the Orpheus myth set in a Depression era America. The album landed her on numerous "Best of 2010" lists including The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Observer. Her latest album is 'Young Man in America.' 

LITTLE G. WEEVIL is a Hungarian who migrated to Memphis, eager enough to soak up the culture and music enough to wash dishes on Beale Street just to get as close as possible. He started out as a drummer and began playing the guitar at 17. He was introduced and captivated by the music scene through listening to legendary musicians such as John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Albert Collins, B.B. King and Chuck Berry.His approach to the American Roots and Blues Music makes him one of a kind. This high energy and very laid back performer sings his heart out, picks his guitar and his Bacon Fat cigar box guitar like he just got "struck by lightning" and tells his real life stories in a way that is really hard to forget.

                    <title>Woodsongs 659: Celebration of Kentucky Bluegrass featuring: Don Rigsby, Sugar Tree, The 23 String Band, Bawn in the Mash &amp; Blakely Burger</title>
                    <description>DON RIGSBY is one of the most accomplished bluegrass musicians working in Kentucky. From remote Isonville, KY, to an international following in Bluegrassmusic, Don has remained true to his mountain roots and made his own marks as a powerful tenor and distinctive mandolin player. Don played with JD Crowe and The New South, and was a member of the award-winning Lonesome River Band. The two-time Grammy nominee and two-time SPBGMA Traditional MaleVocalist of the Year and sang on a Grammy-winning album by rocker John Fogerty.


SUGAR TREE are three wanderin' women who found their way back to the tippy-toes of the Appalachian foothills in Berea. This string trio are known for their pristine vocal harmonies, traditional and contemporary song choices and cowgirl boots.


THE 23 STRING BAND hail from all around Kentucky. The band pays a fun, fuel-injected, original Americana that dangerously weaves across the lanes of modern acoustic music — windows down, accelerator to the floor, on a joyride into the unknown with one eye on the vintage sounds in the rearview mirror. It's a bluegrass attack fueled by high-octane rock-n-roll energy and triple-distilled organic roots. The guys won the prestigious band competition at RockyGrass in Lyons, CO in 2011. Their latest album is 'Catch 23.'


BAWN IN THE MASH are entering their seventh year of performing their sound founded in the ancient tones of Western Kentucky. Based in Paducah, early fans watched the band go from busking Appalachian street corners to headlining the Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion-- from performing on the corner of 4th and Broadway to selling out the world famous Station Inn-- and from playing local barrooms to performing in the Victorian Ballroom aboard the Delta Queen steamboat, as the band continually progresses and impresses listeners worldwide. The band has just released their 4th studio album.


BLAKELY BURGER is hails from Lexington and is known around town as the &amp;ldquo;That Lil Fiddler.” This 13 year old comes from a musical family and specialty is bluegrass fiddling, although she also is currently learning mandolin, guitar, and piano.</description>

                    <description>DERVISH was formed in Northwestern Ireland in 1989 and has grown into a vital force on the international Irish music scene. Its artistry, musicianship and maturity won outstanding praise from the media placing Dervish at the forefront of the bands working on traditional Irish music. In its 20 plus years, the band has performed from the Great Wall of China to packed auditoriums in the Holy Land and more recently being the first Irish band to perform at the greatest music festival in the world, "Rock in Rio" on front of an estimate audience of two hundred and forty thousand people. In 2010, the band released "From Stage to Stage" a live concert footage from both sides of the Atlantic that marked Dervish's 21st year anniversary.

THE DEVIL MAKES THREE are laced with elements of ragtime, blues, country, folk and rockabilly. The critically praised trio - consisting of guitarist/front man Pete Bernhard, stand-up bassist Lucia Turino and guitarist Cooper McBean - bring a genuine approach to acoustic music. The sound is deeply steeped in rhythm and alive with three part harmonies, while keeping a high-energy aesthetic to their music and especially their live shows. "Stomp and Smash: Live at the Mystic Theatre" is band's latest release.</description>

                    <description>GARY "BISCUIT" DAVIS is the only three-time National Banjo Champion in America and has won dozens of state and regional titles as well. Gary got his nickname, "Biscuit" when he was performing with the Smith Brothers as lead guitarist. They had a guitar player that they nicknamed "Cornbread," so he could be "Biscuit." Gary performed for fifteen years at Dollywood, recently was band leader, co-producer and banjo player for Dolly Parton on her bluegrass album "Halos &amp; Horns". He toured with Dolly for a year to promote that album/

THE HACKENSAW BOYS have their feet firmly planted in the old-time song tradition, have their hands soiled by the dirt of rock n' roll and have their eyes fixed steadily on the future of real country music. This Charlottesville, VA group is among the most exciting groups charting new territory in today's diverse Americana music scene after seven years of relentless touring throughout the United States, Europe and the U.K.. The group's latest efforts, "The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1 and The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2," deliver original material that draws upon the songwriting talents of its members. It's a celebratory but defiant sound culled from old-time mountains, backstage doorways and punishing drives through the evolving American landscape.</description>

                    <description>BLACKIE AND THE RODEO KINGS originally formed in 1996. Now into their second decade and with one JUNO award and several JUNO nominations under their belts, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings has organically evolved into one of the finest roots-oriented bands in North America. They have released seven CDs and gradually developed a feeling of brotherhood manifested in a sense of groove, timberal blend and melodic and rhythmic play that is distinctive, mystical, energizing and constantly evocative. Blackie and the Rodeo Kings remains one of Canada's greatest musical treasures. Their latest CD is 'Kings and Queens' and pairs the band with some of their favorite female singers and friends including Roseanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Janiva Magness, Lucinda Williams and more. 

FOLK UKE is an eclectic acoustic folk duo comprised of Cathy Guthrie and Amy Nelson featuring perfectly melded harmonies and sharp, often biting wit. The daughters of two great American songwriters (Arlo and Willie), the two were musical holdouts until they gave into the force and began writing and playing music together a decade ago. Armed with a ukulele and a guitar, this duo is a unique amalgam of angelic harmonies often wrapped around edgy, surprising lyrics. Check out YouTube for some of their more provocative songs. Folk Uke plays folk music in its truest form with a delightfully wicked twist. The duo's latest album is "Reincarnation."</description>

Melding brass with banjo, guitar, bass and drums, this five-piece ensemble boasts an eclectic mesh of instruments and styles -- a musical alchemy all their own as they travel the country spreading the magic of their heart-throbbing, foot-stomping, good-time music. 

THE DIRT DAUBERS hail from Paducah, Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee. This trio has traveled the world, singing loud-and-proud an eclectic mix of Appalachian, ragtime and hot jazz standards and original music. From cowboy songs to bluegrass, Harlem jazz to honky tonk, the Daubers tackle it all with vim, verve and vigor. The Dirt Daubers have gained the encouragement and/or approval of such varied stars as Les Claypool, Charlie Louvin, and Jello Biafra. Their new album is Wake Up Sinners.</description>

                    <description>THE CLEVERLYS are one of the most outrageous bands that we've ever come across. This "family" band comes from the remote part of the Ozark Mountains, near Cane Spur, Arkansas. Their twisted sense of humor and stellar musicianship rocked this year's CMA Fest and their YouTube downloads have topped over a million. They have an incredible "backstory" and a timeless bluegrass sound. What makes the band unusual is their choice of material. They cover The Black Eyed Peas, The Bangles, and many other unexpected choices. 

STETSON &amp; CIA are a new acoustic roots duo made up banjo master Cia Cherryholmes and songwriter Stetson Adkisson. Cia began playing music at the age of 15 with the internationally acclaimed band Cherryholmes. As their lead singer, banjoist, and main songwriter, she garnered 5 Grammy nominations over the band's 12 year career. Stetson Adkisson started his musical career in 2003. As a singer, songwriter, and guitarist he has played many venues in the Western United States and released a self-titled album in 2006. As a duo, they have just released their first self-titled debut album.</description>

                    <description>JANIE FRICKE with THE ROYS: Country star Janie has gone from Indiana farm girl to internationally acclaimed recording artist. Fricke dominated the country charts with smash hits such as He's a Heartache, Don't Worry ' Bout Me Baby, and You're Heart's Not In It. She won the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year and she was chosen to the Country Music Hall of Fame Walkway of Stars, nominated for a Grammy Award. Janie has released 23 albums and 36 hit singles. Now, she has moved into bluegrass territory, rearranging some of her best-known music on the album 'Country Side of Bluegrass.' She'll perform on the show with WoodSongs alum and good friends The Roys.

MATT FLINNER is widely considered one of the hottest and most creative mandolin players on the acoustic scene. Starting out as a banjo prodigy who was playing bluegrass festivals before he entered his teens, Flinner later took up the mandolin, won the National Banjo Competition in Winfield, KS in 1990, and won the mandolin award there the following year. He has toured and recorded with a wide variety of bluegrass, new acoustic, classical and jazz artists, including Tim O'Brien, Frank Vignola, Steve Martin, Darrell Scott, the Modern Mandolin Quartet, Leftover Salmon, Alison Brown, The Ying Quartet, Tony Trischka, Darol Anger, and the Nashville Chamber Orchestra.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 652: Judy Collins</title>
                    <description>JUDY COLLINS has thrilled audiences worldwide with her unique blend of interpretative folksongs and contemporary themes.

She has a brand new CD called "Bohemian" and a brand new book "Sweet Judy Blue Eyes: My Life in Music."

Her impressive career has spanned more than 40 years. At 13, Judy Collins made her public debut performing Mozart's "Concerto for Two Pianos" but it was the music of such artists as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, as well as the traditional songs of the folk revival, that sparked Judy Collins' love of lyrics. In 1961, Judy Collins released her first album, A Maid of Constant Sorrow, at the age of 22.

Her rendition of Joni Mitchell's "Both Sides Now" on her classic 1967 album, Wildflowers. "Both Sides Now" has since been entered into the Grammy's Hall of Fame. Winning "Song of the Year" at the 1975 Grammy's Awards show was Judy's version of "Send in the Clowns."

Judy's book, "Sanity and Grace, A Journey of Suicide, Survival and Strength" is a deeply moving memoir, focusing on the death of her only son and the healing process following the tragedy. The book speaks to all who have endured the sorrow of losing a loved one before their time. In a recent appearance on ABC's Good Morning America, Judy performed "Wings of Angels," the heartbreaking ballad that she wrote about the loss of her son. The song is currently available on Judy Collins Wildflower Festival CD and DVD, which also feature guest artists Arlo Guthrie, Tom Rush and Eric Andersen.

Judy Collins continues to create music of hope and healing that lights up the world and speaks to the heart and WoodSonmgs is proud for her special event return to our show.</description>

                    <description>IMELDA MAY, born in Dublin, Ireland and raised in the Liberties, may be an unknown name to some, but to many she is already a superstar. She is unmistakable both in her music (a fusion of surf guitars, blues and rockabilly that wouldn't be out of place in a David Lynch film) and her style, with a solitary curl and shock of blonde in her jet black hair. In Ireland, her debut album 'Love Tattoo', which she recorded and released on her own label, has gone Triple Platinum. She has shared a stage with Eric Clapton, Chuck Berry, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Van Morrison, Lionel Richie, Wanda Jackson, and Meatloaf.

APRIL VERCH is a dynamic award winning Canadian fiddler, singer and stepdancer. With her band, she plays a traditional and original repertoire that is deeply rooted in the style she grew up with in the Ottawa Valley region of Ontario. She became the first women in history to win both of Canada's most prestigious fiddle championships, The Gran Masters and Canadian Open; and when Canada hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, she was asked to represent her country's music at the opening ceremonies. Her latest album 'That's How We Run' is her eighth release and explores Appalachian mountain music with her Northern roots.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 650: Ruthie Foster &amp; Marquise Knox</title>
                    <description>RUTHIE FOSTER can burn down any stage with her combustible blend of soul, blues, rock, folk and making her one of the most dynamic voices that has ever graced the WoodSongs stage. Foster was catapulted to the forefront of the blues/roots world on the strength of her 2009 Grammy-nominated record, 'The Truth According To Ruthie Foster,' and her relentless touring. She then won seemingly contradictory Blues Music Association awards for both Best Traditional and Best Contemporary Female Blues Artist in back-to-back years. Her latest record 'Let It Burn' was recorded in New Orleans and features Blind Boys of Alabama, soul legend William Bell, and songs by Adele, Black Keys, Los Lobos, Johnny Cash, The Band, Pete Seeger, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and more.

MARQUISE KNOX asks on his new record "Can a young man play the blues?" This 21 year old St. Louis native hails from a musical family deeply entrenched in the blues. He learned how to play guitar from his grandmother whose family were sharecroppers and whose great, great grandparents were slaves. He spent his early teenage years in St. Louis mentoring under the late great Blues legend Henry James Townsend. Marquise's talents have earned him performing rights with some of America's most notable blues performers such as blues legend B.B. King, Pinetop Perkins and David "Honeyboy" Edwards. He won a Living Blues Award for Best Debut and takes another big step forward with the release of his new CD.</description>

Born in Memphis, Billy was recently inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He has penned hit songs for everyone from Ray Charles, Cher, Roy Orbison to Alan Jackson and Faith Hill. He's also known as an acclaimed guitarist touring with Bob Dylan John Fogerty among others, as well a member of Fleetwood Mac. His recent release of 'Rock &amp; Roll With It' is his 1st studio album in a decade.

LYDIA LOVELESS is blessed with a commanding, strong voice. The 21-year-old Lydia Loveless was raised on a family farm in the small rural town of Coshocton, Ohio. Her dad owned a country music bar and she often woke up with a house full of touring musicians scattered on couches and floors. When she got older, in the time-honored traditions of teenage rebellion, she moved to the big city (Columbus, OH) and immersed herself in the punk scene. These two worlds now collide on her debut CD on Bloodshot Records 'Indestructible Machine.' The album combines Lydia's country roots with punk rock candor -- sometimes within the same song.</description>

                    <description>NOAM PIKELNY returns to the WoodSongs Stage to celebrate his long awaited second album "Beat The Devil and Carry A Rail" on Compass Records. Pikelny is undeniably the next big thing to happen to the 5-string banjo, a player of unparalleled technique, he confounds and inspires listeners with his mastery of the instrument. As a member of Punch Brothers, he has helped to broaden the awareness of the banjo in the mainstream, earning the first annual Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass Music and a coveted appearance on Late Night with David Letterman with Martin. Noam will be joined on the show with a few of his friends: fellow Punch Brothers Gabe Witcher (fiddle) and Chris Eldridge (guitar), Aoife O'Donovan from Crooked Still (vocals), Jesse Cobb (mandolin) and Mark Schatz (bass).

VICTOR FURTADO is an amazing 11 year old banjo player from Front Royal, VA. He has won numerous awards for his Old Time banjo playing, quite often competing in the adult categories. Some of the contests he has placed in are: Deer Creek Festival, Maryland 1st Place Adult Old Time Banjo, Maury River Fiddlers Convention, Virginia, 1st Place Adult Old Time Banjo and best in show, Grayson County Fiddlers Convention, Virginia, 1st Place Adult Old Time Banjo, Virginia State Fair, 1st Place Adult Banjo, National Old Time Banjo Championship,(Uncle Dave Macon Days Festival, Tennessee, and 2nd Place Adult Old Time Banjo.

                    <title>Woodsongs 645: Masters of the Guitar featuring Muriel Anderson, Jack Pearson &amp; Vicki Genfan</title>
                    <description>MURIEL ANDERSON is widely respected as one of the world's foremost fingerstyle guitarists and harp-guitarists. Muriel is the first woman to have won the National Fingerpicking Guitar Championship. She is host of the renowned Muriel Anderson's All Star Guitar Night and founder of the Music for Life Alliance charity. Her music can be heard in Woody Allen's film "Vicky Cristina Barcelona."

JACK PEARSON is a former guitarist with The Allman Brothers Band and has been playing professionally since the age of 15. Although best known as a blues &amp; jazz guitarist, he's also a singer, songwriter &amp; producer. Jack has worked live or in the studio with a long list of artists including Vince Gill, Jimmy Buffett, Earl Scruggs, Chris LeDoux, Delbert McClinton, Bobby "Blue" Bland, and Chuck Leavell to name a few.

VICKI GENFAN is a virtuoso guitarist, singer and composer. Guitar player magazine crowned her a new "Guitar Superstar" in 2008 Drawing from folk, jazz, pop, soul and world music, Vicki is redefining 'singer/songwriter culture.' With a mastery of the acoustic guitar that borders on pure alchemy, audiences are mesmerized by the waves of sound Vicki creates with just two hands and her voice. Using 29 alternate tunings and the percussive technique she calls 'slap-tap', you'll find the addition of her pure, expressive vocals that dig deep and stir the heart to be the perfect accompaniment on many of her songs.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 644: Eric Brace &amp; Peter Cooper and The Richter Uzur Duo</title>
                    <description>ERIC BRACE &amp; PETER COOPER have a created a body of work that reflects their literate sensibilities as songwriters, a love of harmony and wry humor, and their deep respect for the masters they're lucky enough to play with. When Brace and Cooper play together, it's something special. The pair's last album, 'Master Sessions,' is a tour de force that made its way onto numerous critics' Best of 2010 lists.Their most recent project, 'I Love: Tom T. Hall's Songs of Fox Hollow,' was featured on NPR's All Things Considered and Weekend Edition. It's a tribute to country music's greatest storytelling songwriter and Kentucky native Tom T. Hall.

THE RICHTER UZUR DUO are each classical musicians of the highest caliber with successful international solo careers and intensive training from two of the world's most lauded musical institutions: The Moscow Conservatory and The Royal College of Music respectively. Their musical interests and abilities, however, are far from limited to classical music. In their teens and twenties, while developing into classical virtuosi, they cut their teeth in rock bands and delved into folk and world music. The duo's uniqueness is how they combine classical, rock and folk music and themes into truly original new compositions. The duo's latest recording is 'String Theory' and it was named best new release by Classical Guitar Alive in 2010.</description>

                    <description>JAKE SCHEPPS has made a name for himself as a banjo renaissance man, an artist with not only an adroit touch on his instrument but an intrepid, imaginative vision for contemporary stringband music. Although a student of traditional and progressive bluegrass styles as a player, Schepps has stretched beyond those genres to take his place alongside the Punch Brothers, Matt Flinner and other notables in a field the Colorado-based banjoist likes to call simply "new acoustic music." His venturesome new album, 'An Evening in the Village: The Music of Béla Bartók,' finds common ground between the piquant beauty of the great Hungarian composer's take on Eastern European folk melodies and the big-sky vibrancy of new American acoustic music.

HARPETH RISING is a group of four young classically trained musicians exploring the Americana genre. With a banjo and fiddle, you might think they're traditional bluegrass, but think again: cello and hand drums round out the group, creating a truly new sound. A little bit bluegrass, a little bit folk, a little bit classical and whole lot of original, Harpeth Rising is a band to watch. The band just released their second album, with Grammy-award winning producer Bil VornDick, entitled 'Dead Man's Hand'.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 642: Michael Martin Murphey and Horse Crazy Cowgirl Band</title>
                    <description>MICHAEL MARTIN MURPHEY's song "Wildfire" was one of the biggest pop hits of the 70's. He returns to the WoodSongs stage with a brand new bluegrass CD called 'Tall Grass &amp; Cool Water.' It's his third album in this Grammy nominated series that explores the similarities between Bluegrass and American Cowboy Music. This "singing cowboy poet", is not only the number one, best-selling singer/ songwriter of American Cowboy Music, he's one of the world's most respected singer/ songwriters in the Pop and Country-Western field.

HORSE CRAZY COWGIRL BAND is an award winning western trio featuring beautiful harmony, excellent musicianship, and heart-hugging hilarious stage presence. Performing all over the United States and Canada, this wonderful group brings the audience along the trail of the American Western experience with traditional cowboy music and original compositions about love of place and land. This rural Washington State Trio are winners of the 2010 Western Music Association's Harmony Trio Award and were nominated for Cowboy/Western Swing Group of the Year and Album of the Year 2008 and 2009. The trio's latest recording is 'My Horse Knows The Way.'</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 641: Keith Medley and Donna Ulisse</title>
                    <description>KEITH MEDLEY is a Kentucky native and plays one of the most unusual instruments that we've ever come across. It's a one-of-a-kind 27-string guitar that Steve designed himself. In the late 70's his band opened for up-and-comers like George Strait, Johnny Paycheck, Ed Bruce, Rita Coolidge, Neil Young and many more from that era. When Keith got off the road in the late 80s he focused on another passion, building and repairing guitars. He eventually went to work for one of the largest guitar companies in the country building custom guitars, and for a few years also ran his own company, Medley Guitars and with it performs his own compositions.

DONNA ULISSE (pronounced "you-liss-ee") was born in Hampton Virginia and surrounded by a musical family. Donna made her first appearance singing at the tender age of three when she wandered onto the stage with a bluegrass band. Since then, bluegrass fans are getting to know Ulisse for her songwriter-driven brand of bluegrass, often called "bluegrass without borders." As a writer she has recently had songs recorded by Claire Lynch, Darin &amp; Brooke Aldridge and also had the title cut to Louise Mosrie's "Home" which was the #1 Folk album in the nation in January 2010. In June of 2011 Hadley Music Group released a fourth CD on Ulisse; another collection of original tunes by this gifted singer songwriter titled "An Easy Climb". Also, she just completed a tour of Russia. The invitation to perform was sent from the U.S. Embassy in Russia where Donna performed with several Russian bluegrass bands.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 640: John Gorka &amp; Eliza Gilkyson and Blitz the Ambassador</title>
                    <description>JOHN GORKA AND ELIZA GILKYSON are considered two of the best contemporary Singer/songwriters touring today. These longtime friends recently teamed up with Lucy Kaplansky to form the super folk group Red Horse. The trio's self titled debut CD was released last year and it became an instant folk classic and a big hit with fans.

JOHN GORKA is a world-renowned singer-songwriter who was raised in New Jersey and came out of New York City's Greenwich Village folk scene that produced such songwriters as Suzanne Vega and Shawn Colvin. His award-winning songs have been recorded and performed by such notable artists as Mary Chapin Carpenter, Nanci Griffith and Mary Black. John has recorded eleven solo albums, six on Red House Records. His latest is So Dark You See.

ELIZA GILKYSON is a politically minded, poetically gifted singer-songwriter, who has become one of the most respected musicians in roots, folk and Americana circles. The Grammy-nominated artist was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2006, she was recognized with 3 Austin Music Awards and 4 Folk Alliance Music Awards, one of which was for "Song of the Year" for her tune "Man of God." Her latest solo CD is Roses at the End of Time on Red House Records. 

BLITZ THE AMBASSADOR may seem like an unusual booking for WoodSongs at first glance. The Ghanaian-born, New York-based composer, and producer unleashes psychedelic Afrobeat colors and triple-time rhymes with a lightning-fast mind, the political boldness of Chuck D, and the sixth groove sense of Fela Kuti. All set to swirls of brass, distorted guitars, and the crackle and pop of old amplifiers. However, for his WoodSongs performance, Blitz will be performing a more intimate, stripped down set. Check out his video for "Remembering The Future" to see this talented artist in action as Michael welcomes the show's first hip hop artist and explores the genre's connection to folk music.</description>

                    <description>OLLABELLE is a multi-talented, democratic collective whose participants share vocal and songwriting duties. This New York quintet draws from a deep well of gospel, blues, bluegrass, and country influences to create timelessly resonant music that honors the integrity of its sources while remaining effortlessly contemporary. Emmylou Harris said of the band, "Every time I hear something on the radio I truly love, it's Ollabelle." The band has emerged from a five year period of great artistic and personal change - including marriages, births, tours and other projects - to deliver their most assured, deeply felt album to date, "Neon Blue Bird." The CD was produced by Ollabelle and recorded in Athens, NY and at Levon Helm Studios in Woodstock.

GOITSE (pronounced gwi-cha) is a five member Irish Trad band which specializes in their unique rhythmic arrangements of well known tunes and own compositions. Goitse is a Donegal Irish word meaning 'come here'. The band, now in it's third year, are all students of Traditional Music and Dance at the University of Limerick and have captured several prominent awards including Colm Phelan becoming the first World Bodhrán Champion. This is the band's first tour in the states.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 637: Woody Pines and Colin O'Brien</title>
                    <description>WOODY PINES transports you to the Mississippi Delta when AM radio was king with his energetic brand of Roots Music, Ragtime, Country Blues, and Viper Jazz. The band; comprised of Woody on guitar, banjo, harmonica and lead vocals, Zack Pozebanchuk on upright bass, Nathan Taylor on drums, and Darin Gentry on fiddle; epitomizes the Dixieland sound and embraces a simpler time. If Pines' elegantly-disheveled fedora and vintage resonator guitar don't set the mood (both are strongly suggestive of the musician's mix of ragtime, country blues and lightning-speed folk), the backing band does the trick. Crackerjack musicianship goes a long way toward a band's greatness, but showmanship seals the deal. Pines, on stage, is an old soul and natural performer, storied and steeped in the best of Americana. As honky tonk hero, Billy Joe Shaver puts it, "Woody Pines is the best band I ever heard in my life I swear.... I'm their biggest fan now!" 

COLIN O'BRIEN is a prolific nationally touring performer, recording artist and master multi-musician known for his John Hartford Tribute show. Colin plays the daylights out of the banjo, fiddle and guitar, and his feet stay mighty busy as well dancing rhythms on his magic hardwood "Clogginator." Colin didn't start out as a folkie. He studied classical guitar at the Cornish College of the Arts, before moving to Milwaukee in 1993 to study guitar at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. He's on the faculty there now teaching Banjo, Guitar and Fiddle, has been since 2000. Colin has published two banjo instructional books and a DVD and most recently he's released an all instrumental guitar record, "Inside These Guitars."</description>

                    <description>THE HILLBENDERS are undeniably the hottest young band on the acoustic scene. Claiming the championship title at the 2009 Telluride Bluegrass Band Competition helped put The HillBenders on the map, and their recent victory at the 2010 National Single Microphone Championships prove that they continue to be a force to be reckoned with. These buzz-worthy bluegrass whiz-kids are quickly rising above many of their peers and gaining international recognition for their aggressive combination of contemporary influences with traditional inspiration and instrumentation, as well as their infectiously energetic stage performances. The HillBenders released their debut album Down To My Last Dollar in spring 2010 and are currently working on their follow-up CD

AL PETTEWAY &amp; AMY WHITE are an award winning duo that performs contemporary Celtic- &amp; Appalachian-Influenced Acoustic Groove. Their music was featured throughout the soundtrack of the 2009 Ken Burns EMMY-winning documentary, The National Parks: America's Best Idea. And in 2010, their album, "Caledon Wood" (which includes the main theme of the National Parks documentary) was names one of the essential albums of the past 20 years in Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Their recent album "High in the Blue Ridge" released early this year.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>THE HILLBENDERS are undeniably the hottest young band on the acoustic scene. Claiming the championship title at the 2009 Telluride Bluegrass Band Competition helped put The HillBenders on the map, and their recent victory at the 2010 National Single Microphone Championships prove that they continue to be a force to be reckoned with. These buzz-worthy bluegrass whiz-kids are quickly rising above many of their peers and gaining international recognition for their aggressive combination of contemporary influences with traditional inspiration and instrumentation, as well as their infectiously energetic stage performances. The HillBenders released their debut album Down To My Last Dollar in spring 2010 and are currently working on their follow-up CD

AL PETTEWAY &amp; AMY WHITE are an award winning duo that performs contemporary Celtic- &amp; Appalachian-Influenced Acoustic Groove. Their music was featured throughout the soundtrack of the 2009 Ken Burns EMMY-winning documentary, The National Parks: America's Best Idea. And in 2010, their album, "Caledon Wood" (which includes the main theme of the National Parks documentary) was names one of the essential albums of the past 20 years in Acoustic Guitar Magazine. Their recent album "High in the Blue Ridge" released early this year.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>NU BLU is a great bluegrass band fronted by husband and wife team Daniel and Carolyn Routh and are creating quite a stir in the bluegrass community. In 2011, Nu-Blu was again nominated by the Carolina Music Awards and geared up for their new album, THE BLU-DISC on Pinecastle Records. The label has released the first single, "Other Woman's Blues" written by Kira Small and providing a unique twist on Dolly Parton's hit song "Jolene." 

DARIN AND BROOKE ALDRIDGE is a rising bluegrass duo, newlyweds singing and playing a rich combination of bluegrass and country duets. Their rich harmonies, supported by a first rate band, showcase two fine individual voices with a superb blend. Darin played with Acoustic Syndicate and worked several years in the legendary band The County Gentlemen. Brooke Justice Aldridge grew up on the mountains of Avery County, NC. Her voice carries the lilt of the mountains along with the sophisticated sounds of a singer with experience way beyond her 25 years.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 634: Hot Tuna and Mountain Heart</title>
                    <description>HOT TUNA is founding members of the legacy rock band Jefferson Airplane, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady. They have just released their first studio record in 20 years "Steady As She Goes" on Red House Records and will be performing on WoodSongs in a special acoustic performance to celebrate the album. From their days playing together as teenagers to their current acoustic and electric blues, probably no one has more consistently led American music for the last 50 years. The pair began playing together while growing up in the Washington D.C. area. While in The Jefferson Airplane, putting together the soundtrack of the 60s, the pair remained loyal to the blues, jazz, bluegrass, and folk influences of the small clubs and larger venues they had learned from years before. While in San Francisco and even in hotel rooms on the road, they would play together and worked up a set of songs that they would often play at clubs in the Bay Area and while on the road, often after having played a set with the Airplane. This led to a record contract; in fact, they had an album recorded before they decided to name their band Hot Tuna. With it they launched on an odyssey which has itself continued for more than 35 years, always finding new and interesting turns in its path forward.

MOUNTAIN HEART is bluegrass super group that has been fearlessly revolutionizing the way acoustic music can be presented and played. The band's name has been synonymous with cutting-edge excellence in acoustic music circles since the group's creation in 1999. Widely known throughout the music industry for continually redefining the boundaries of acoustic music, the band is one of the most highly awarded ensembles ever assembled. Mountain Heart, or members of the band, have either won or been nominated for Grammy's, ACM, CMA, and multiple IBMA Awards. The band is out touring in support of their 7'th album, "That Just Happened", which was released in late 2010 on their own imprint, MH Music Group.</description>

                    <description>VINTAGE WILDFLOWERS is a Tulsa Oklahoma-based trio of women that has developed an enthusiastic legion of fans with their vibrant blend of Celtic harp, Irish flute, fiddle and harmony vocals. Mix in bits of mandolin, whistle, guitar and banjo and you have an idea of what it's like to spend an evening with these women. Their second CD, "Lovely Madness" was released in the spring of this year. 

HOOTS &amp; HELLMOUTH is a Philadelphia-based roots music act whose music brings together the passion of alt-country and the rustic tone of acoustic folk, merging them with loping jam band grooves. Sean Hoots and Andrew Gray (aka Hellmouth) were both veterans of the Pennsylvania alternative rock scene when they began making music together in 2005. After a breakthrough appearance at the 2006 Philadelphia Folk Festival, the group established a loyal following. The band's latest is an EP called "Face First in the Dirt."</description>

                    <description>BLAME SALLY is one of the most powerful word-of-mouth success stories in recent years.. Each of the four women put her individual career aside to start Blame Sally in the San Fransisco Bay-area when they were in their late thirties and forties – the age at which bands are traditionally supposed to break up and begin solo careers. Their latest CD is "Speeding Ticket and a Valentine" released on Ninth Street Opus.Water."

THE TWILITE BROADCASTERS continues the longstanding tradition of two part rural harmony vocals with simple acoustic string instrument accompaniment once common in the Southern part of the United States (starting in the 1930's). The irinfluences include The Monroe Brothers,The Louvin Brothers, The Stanley Brothers, Jim and Jesse, and more but have a sound that is uniquely theirs. Adam Tanner and Mark Jackson formed the group in 2009 in Weaverville, North Carolina. They have just released a new recording called "The Trail of Time."</description>

                    <description>ROCKIN' ACOUSTIC CIRCUS are building quite a buzz in the world of bluegrass and have quickly become one of Oklahoma's hottest up-and-coming bands. They are turning heads with an over-flowing talent pool and musicianship beyond their years. Comprised of four teens – (one a female cellist) and a musical veteran, this ensemble is wowing crowds and critics alike. Quickly morphing from a popular regional favorite into a group with nationally recognized aspirations, the band was recently named as one of eleven "Artist to Watch in 2011" and selected as a 2011 IBMA Official Showcase Artist. RAC's newest CD is 'Lonestar Lullabye.' 

KJ DENHERT is a unique artist, singer, guitarist and songwriter who calls her music Urban Folk and Jazz. KJ, born Karen Jeannne to parents from the island of Grenada, was the first US citizen born to a small family. Her special blend of urban folk &amp; jazz has earned her four Independent Music Award nominations and in '09, she was named as one of Jazz.com's top female vocalists. This New York City artist has just released her ninth release aptly titled Album No.9, with nine songs including her remarkable version of Deep Purple's "Smoke On The Water."</description>

What most fans outside Australia don't know is that his career began playing alongside his equally talented older brother Phil. The Emmanuel Brothers are celebrating 50 years of performing music. This dynamic show premiered in Australia in December and is playing to sold-out crowds across the country. Tommy's latest album is "Little by Little." Tommy was also featured on the late Michael Jackson's new album, playing on the track "MUCH TOO SOON". If you love the guitar and want to go on a six-string rocket ship ride with us, don't miss this broadcast!!!</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 623: Milkdrive &amp; Bettysoo and Doug Cox</title>
                    <description>MILKDRIVE is an Alt-folk-progressive acoustic string band that is generating quite a buzz in the Austin music scene. The band features several award winning musicians. Dennis Ludiker, who has toured with Asleep at the Wheel, won the 2009 RockyGrass Mandolin Contest and holds titles as the 2010 World Fiddle Champion, 2009 and 2008 Texas State-Fiddlers Frolics and 2002 Walnut Valley Music Festival Winner. Brian Beken was 2004 Texas Flatpick Guitar Champion. Noah Jeffries won a Lionel Hampton International Jazz Festival Jazz Guitar Competition. With the addition of bass player Matt Mefford, who was in South Austin Jug Band with Ludiker and Beken, the band was complete and became MilkDrive two years ago. The band has put the finishing touches on its debut studio album, ROAD FROM HOME.

BETTYSOO &amp; DOUG COX might seem an unlikely pair. One hails from songwriter's heaven in Austin, Texas, the other from the paradisaical reaches of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The two musicians met while teaching at Acoustic Alaska Guitar Camp, where they discovered a shared fondness for good songs. They decided to create a project built around the stories and work of their mostly-unsung heroes. With two voices, a guitar and a Dobro, their CD "Across the Borderline" gathers different places and sounds: low and high, north and south, hope and heartbreak.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 622: Janiva Magness &amp; The Honey Dewdrops</title>
                    <description>JANIVA MAGNESS returns to WoodSongs on the heels of FOUR major Blues Awards for 2011 including: BB King Entertainer Of The Year, Album Of The Year, Contemporary Blues Female Artist Of The Year, and Contemporary Blue Album Of The Year. Although Magness is now a bona fide blues star, her rise to the top was far from easy. She has been performing for almost three decades, logging thousands of miles on the road and appearing 150 nights a year at clubs, theaters and festivals all over the world. Janiva and her full band will be supporting her latest CD on Alligator Records called "The Devil Is An Angel Too." In addition to her musical accomplishments, Magness is reaching out to help others. She is a National Spokesperson for Casey Family Programs (her fourth consecutive year), promoting National Foster Care Month.

THE HONEY DEWDROPS make their home in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Charlottesville, Virginia. Laura Wortman and Kagey Parrish have been playing music in some capacity for over 15 years, but honed in on their natural duet abilities 7 years ago when they met for the first time in college. It was their love of folk music that brought them together and has since taken them out on the road to tour fulltime as the award-winning duet they are today. After their appearance and first place win on a 2008 talent show broadcast of NPR's "A Prairie Home Companion", the Dewdrops began their careers as songwriters and have since released two critically acclaimed albums.</description>

They are from Colorado and have graced stages throughout the US, Europe, Australia, Canada, and are a WoodSongs fan favorite.

HYMN FOR HER is Lucy Tight &amp; Wayne Waxing, a band that hails from anywhere they can park their trailer ...t hey live, tour and record in their 16 foot, 1961 Bambi Airstream (comes with dog and baby). Their new release, ‘Lucy &amp; Wayne and THE AMERICAN STREAM’ was entirely recorded in their classic trailer on a coast to coast U.S tour. They stopped at various campgrounds and friends driveways between shows, set up their gear in their Bambi/home recording studio, rolled tape and rocked out. Armed with 2 bullet mics, a three-stringed broom handle/cigar box, banjo, dobro, bass drum, hi-hat, and harp, this ‘lil duo causes massive earthquakes wherever they play.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 620: Holly Golightley &amp; Lipbone Redding</title>
                    <description>HOLLY GOLIGHTLY started her musical career in the United Kingdom as a co-founding member of all girl garage band Thee Headcoatees. Holly made her first solo album, The Good Things, in 1995. After playing with The White Stripes in the USA, and supporting them at a few London shows, Holly and her long-time US band mate Lawyer Dave, have a new side project under the guise of Holly Golightly and The Brokeoffs. The two will be performing material from their new CD called "Medicine County" which is chock-full of ghostly blues, gut-bucket slide guitar, with a smattering of ol' time country.

LIPBONE REDDING is an inventive singer/songwriter and former subway musician who creates original songs that effervesce with New Orleans swing, Memphis grooves and New York City style. Known for his ability to use his vocals to sound exactly like a trombone, it's hard to tell the difference -- unless you witness the phenomenon live. Lipbone and his two-man orchestra (the Lipbone Orchestra) make for a show greased with uncanny riffs of vocal trumpeting, booming mouth percussion, hilarious side moments and esoteric lyrics.</description>

                    <description>AMANDA SHIRES is a singing fiddle-playing Texan who just released her second solo CD called "Carrying Lightning." She deftly employs her fiddle/violin, ukulele and even whistling ... the resulting sound is a beautiful but woozily surrealistic swoon. Amanda was also recently seen in the recent Hollywood movie Country Strong where she played the fiddle player in the band backing Gwyneth Paltrow's fictional country superstar. WoodSongs alum Rod Picott will join Amanda on acoustic guitar. 

BEN HALL is a 22-year old multi talented National Thumbpicking Champion from Okolona, Mississippi. Ben has also been recognized nationally as a singer/songwriter who prefers traditional styles of music. While attending Belmont University, Hall has managed to perform at some of Nashville's most famous venues including the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Although he makes frequent appearances as a soloist, Hall has worked the stage as a sideman for legends such as Jeannie Seely, Jan Howard and Charlie Louvin. Ben has recorded with Louvin, Kurt Wagner &amp; Cortney Tidwell, and Candi Staton. In 2011 Tompkins Square will release a new Ben Hall album full of guitar tunes heavily influenced by his heroes Merle Travis and Chet Atkins.</description>

                    <description>SIERRA HULL first performed on WoodSongs when she only 10 years old and played with her idol Sam Bush. A lot has changed for Sierra since and she has become an artist in her own right. At 15, she recorded her debut album for Rounder Records called Secrets. Three years and a move from her family’s home in tiny Byrdstown, Ten. to Boston’s Berklee College of Music later, she’s followed her debut with one of the most surefooted transitions into early adulthood put to record on her new CD called Daybreak. Sierra will be performing on WoodSongs with her band Highway 111.

POKEY LAFARGE AND THE SOUTH CITY THREE are a ragtime blues band and originators of the Riverboat Soul sound. This St. Louis musician and singer creative mix of early jazz, string ragtime, country blues and western swing rings true and fine, making him one of the most innovative of all the purists performing American roots music today. It’s wonderfully infectious, and all laid down in front of a big, big swingin’ beat. Pokey will have a new vinyl 73 single on Jack White’s Third Man Records as well as a new full album out later this year.</description>

This St. Louis musician and singer creative mix of early jazz, string ragtime, country blues and western swing rings true and fine, making him one of the most innovative of all the purists performing American roots music today. It’s wonderfully infectious, and all laid down in front of a big, big swingin’ beat. Pokey will have a new vinyl 73 single on Jack White’s Third Man Records as well as a new full album out later this year.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 617: Suzy Bogguss &amp; Ted Yoder</title>
                    <description>SUZY BOGGUSS is a brilliant songwriter with a suitcase full of country music hits. Some of her accomplishments include ten albums for Capitol Records, one of which has been certified platinum and three others, gold. Eight of her singles have cracked country music's top 5. Suzy is the recipient of a Grammy award as well as several awards from the Academy of Country Music, The Country Music association, CMT, and ASCAP. Her latest release is "Sweet Danger" and she hits a new milestone with this collection. 

TED YODER is the 2010 National Hammer Dulcimer Champion – only the third performer to be crowned Champion on his first appearance at the Walnut Valley Festival. Life-long Indiana native Ted grew up in a musically inclined family, like a lot of musicians. His whole life has been filled with writing, performing, recording, experimenting with new instruments... But it wasn't until Ted received his first hammered dulcimer as a wedding gift that Ted knew he'd found his niche. Capturing the Championship title, Ted decided it was time to go professional. Since then, he has released two CD's.</description>

                    <description>BEARFOOT is abluegrass quintet that originally formed in Alaska. The band has already made a mark with four strong releases, including their 2009 Compass Records debut, &amp;ldquo;Doors And Windows” which instantly hit the top of Billboard's Bluegrass Album chart. A mere two years after their initial meeting teaching at their namesake's bluegrass camp for kids, Bearfoot earned one of roots music's most prestigious awards –Telluride Bluegrass Band Champions– an honor they share with artists Dixie Chicks and Nickel Creek. Now based in Nashville, the band has welcomed singer/songwriter Nora Jane Struthers as their newest addition.

THE REVEREND PEYTON’S BIG DAMN BAND is comprised of fingerstyle guitarist Reverend Peyton, his wife and and distant cousin Aaron &amp;ldquo;Cuz” Persinger on drums and bucket. They have only been around for a few years, in that time period these country-blues aficionados from rural Indiana have played more than 250 shows annually and logged more miles on their van than most acts who have been around for a decade. Their latest CD is &amp;ldquo;Wages” on SideOneDummy Records.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 615: Celebration of Appalachia &amp; Mountain Music featuring Emmylou Harris, Darrell Scott, John &amp; Patricia Adams, Nikky Finney with Sue Massek, &amp; Madison Glover - Part 2</title>
                    <description>People have been singing about the mountains for generations. In recent years, the voices singing them have taken on a special urgency with the advent of mountain top removal. The landscape of Appalachia is changing with the times - and so are the songs. In the spirit of this music WoodSongs will tape two broadcasts in one evening on Monday, March 14 at the historic Lexington Opera House featuring an array of artists singing the music of coal country and Appalachia. Michael Johnathon conceived of the broadcast theme after watching a public television broadcast of &amp;ldquo;Coal Country,” a film about the Appalachian mountains by the award winning team of Mari-Lynn Evans and Jordan Freeman. 

EMMYLOU HARRIS began her career singing with the legendary Gram Parson. A member of the Grand Ole Opry, her career has produced huge hits including "Two More Bottles of Wine," and "To Know Him Is to Love Him" from her Grammy winning album with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, Trio. 

DARRELL SCOTT is one of Kentucky's most powerful songwriters. Scott has collaborated with Steve Earle, Sam Bush, Emmylou Harris, John Cowan, Verlon Thompson, Guy Clark, Tim O'Brien, Kate Rusby,  Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and many others. Darrell will perform his deeply moving mountain ballad, &amp;ldquo;You’ll Never Leave Harlan Alive.” 
 
JOHN ADAMS co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington DC. In February 2011, Adams received the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- our nation's highest civilian honor -- from President Obama, who referenced Rolling Stone Magazine's description of Adams when announcing the award: "If the planet has a lawyer, it's John Adams. In 2010, Adams and his wife Patricia co-authored &amp;ldquo;A Force for Nature,” a memoir recounting their forty years of battles and victories with NRDC. He has also served on governmental advisory committees, including President Clinton's Council for Sustainable Development. Patricia Adams is a writer and teacher who has partnered with her husband for many years in environmental activism. They live in the Catskill mountains of NY in a rambling country house that is over 150 years old.

                    <description>GREAT AMERICAN TAXI has become one of the best-known headliners on the jam band circuit. The band was born when singer, guitarist, and mandolin player Vince Herman of Leftover Salmon joined keyboard player and singer Chad Staehly for a superstar jam to benefit the Rainforest Action Group in Boulder, in March of 2005. They’ve made their reputation as an exciting live band and has been equated with roots rockers like the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Grateful Dead, Wilco, Uncle Tupelo, The Byrds, and Little Feat. Their latest album &amp;ldquo;Reckless Habits” was considered one of the best Americana release of 2010.

MICHAEL HEARNE moved to Northern New Mexico 25 years ago from Austin, Texas, and immediately joined forces with numerous other musical luminaries including Michael Martin Murphey and Tish Hinojosa, becoming an integral part of Murphey's band. Called the ‘Acoustic Southwestern Americana Musical Guitar Genius,’ this native Texan continues to leave an indelible mark on his audiences not only with his signature ‘Michael Hearne’ guitar sound, but also with songs and stories that are rich in lyrical prose, imagery and humor. His newest CD, The High Road to Taos, has received critical acclaim, with some discriminating reviewers declaring it to be his finest work to date.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 612: Gary Morris &amp; The Roys</title>
                    <description>GARY MORRIS is most noted for the smash hit 'Wind Beneath My Wings.” Gary has traveled a colorful path from Fort Worth, TX to the White House, Nashville to Opera Houses and beyond. Morris has long been regarded as one of the greatest tenors of our time, having performed for every President since Jimmy Carter, and also the Queen of England. His Country career produced an astounding twenty-five charted singles on the Billboard country charts, with five consecutive No. 1 hits. One of his first big roles was in the Broadway production of Les Miserables, as Jean Valjean. The full symphonic recording of Les Miserables is a Platinum selling, Grammy Award winning album and features Gary's timeless version of 'Bring Him Home.' He also appeared in Puccini's opera 'La Boheme' with fellow musician Linda Ronstadt. &amp;ldquo;Hymns” is his latest record.

THE ROYS are a brother/sister duo who hail from Fitchburg, MA, and their music is a surprisingly fresh, Bluegrass sound that includes hints of Roots and traditional Country, and its uniquely identifiable tone has brought them honors – and fans – from around the globe. The two-time Inspirational Country Music Duo of the Year (2010, 2009) made their national television debut on the most-recent Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon in Las Vegas, and they’ve enjoyed heavy media exposure with multiple People and Country Weekly magazine features to their credit. THE ROYS have performed before President George W. Bush at Andrews Air Force Base; traveled to Bogota, Columbia on an outreach mission for Compassion International, and entertained fans for years at clubs, fairs and festivals. Their latest CD is Lonesome Whistle on Rural Rhythm Records.</description>

His Country career produced an astounding twenty-five charted singles on the Billboard country charts, with five consecutive No. 1 hits. One of his first big roles was in the Broadway production of Les Miserables, as Jean Valjean. The full symphonic recording of Les Miserables is a Platinum selling, Grammy Award winning album and features Gary's timeless version of 'Bring Him Home.' He also appeared in Puccini's opera 'La Boheme' with fellow musician Linda Ronstadt. &amp;ldquo;Hymns” is his latest record.

The southern Ohio-based husband-and-wife team of multi-instrumentalist Linford Detweiler and vocalist Karin Bergquist new CD is a fan-funded record on OtR's own Great Speckled Dog label (named for the couple's Great Dane, Elroy). It was produced by two time Grammy winner Joe Henry whose songs they've long admired and has a guest appearance from Lucinda Williams. The songs seamlessly interweave the disparate strains that form the many-colored crazy quilt of American music.

DAVID WAX MUSEUM was voted "one of Boston's hottest new bands" by The Boston Globe and awarded as the Americana Artist of the Year. They have performed at the Newport Folk Festival (and were featured on NPR's All Songs Considered as one of Newport's highlights), toured with The Avett Brothers, shared bills with Carolina Chocolate Drops and constantly tour around the country. The band's new CD is "Everything Is Saved."</description>

                    <description>GREENSKY BLUEGRASS is earning recognition nationwide as a growing force in bluegrass and acoustic roots music. This Michigan band won the 2006 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Competition. As newcomers to the bluegrass scene, the three sought to define themselves within the framework of their bluegrass favorites while establishing a voice of their own, drawing upon an array of influences and varied musical backgrounds. Greensky Bluegrass is touring in support of their recently released fourth album, "Five Interstates."

EDEN BRENT is a masterful blues pianist and vocal stylist. Her piano playing and singing style ranges from a melancholic whisper to a full-blown juke joint holler. This Mississippi Delta native is a three-time blues music award winner when she won the 2011 Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year. Her acclaimed album "Mississippi Number One" on Yellow Dog Records is a tribute to her home on Mississippi State Highway 1.</description>

                    <description>RONI STONEMAN is a true legend of bluegrass. The youngest daughter of the pioneering country music family The Stonemans, she became "The First Lady of Banjo," a fixture on the Nashville scene, and, as Hee Haw's Ironing Board Lady, a comedienne beloved by millions of Americans nationwide. She recently released a CD with her two sisters and was the subject of book called &amp;ldquo;Pressing On” written by Ellen Wright&#160;

DALE ANN BRADLEY is the 2007, 2008 &amp; 2009 IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year and has been hailed by Alison Krauss and Ricky Skaggs as one of the greatest vocalists in bluegrass music. A former Coon Creek Girl and mainstay at Kentucky's Renfro Valley Barn Dance, Bradley commands a list of awards as long as Highway 40, yet a few minutes with her tells you she is something even more than extraordinarily gifted – she's extraordinarily human.&#160;

BELLA BETTS is a young girl of only 10 but plays mandolin and fiddle like a pro. This Colorado girl is seasoned enough to perform on the main stage at Rockygrass this past summer. Bella also works with the Colorado bluegrass music society to present bluegrass to the schools. She has played with KC Groves and other local musicians during these presentations.&#160;

                    <description>ANGEL BAND is a group of three powerful women artists: Nancy Josephson, Kathleen Weber, and Aly Paige. No audience has been left unmoved by Angel Band’s all out, &amp;ldquo;take no prisoners” stage demeanor and rootsy, bluesy Americana songs. Performing at Bonnaroo, Merlefest, the Philadelphia Folk Festival and other high profile events, this band is winning over many new listeners in their travels. Their new album is titled "Bless My Sole" on Appleseed Records.
MICHAEL HEARNE moved to Northern New Mexico 25 years ago from Austin, Texas, and immediately joined forces with numerous other musical luminaries including Michael Martin Murphey and Tish Hinojosa, becoming an integral part of Murphey's band. Called the ‘Acoustic Southwestern Americana Musical Guitar Genius,’ this native Texan continues to leave an indelible mark on his audiences not only with his signature ‘Michael Hearne’ guitar sound, but also with songs and stories that are rich in lyrical prose, imagery and humor. His newest CD, The High Road to Taos, has received critical acclaim, with some discriminating reviewers declaring it to be his finest work to date.

THE LAWS are a husband and wide duo from Wheatley, Ontario Canada. They are the FIRST Canadians to win the prestigious Chris Austin Song Writing Contest at MerleFest. It's not surprising John and Michele Law kick off their sixth album "Try Love" with the line 'I believe in love at first sight,' as the album marks The Laws' 10 years and one million miles on the road as a couple.</description>

                    <description>THE STEELDRIVERS brand of bluegrass is intense, dark, poetic, and inescapably human. It's a refreshing reminder of the timeless power of stringband music. This group of seasoned veterans from Nashville are each are distinguished in his or her own right. They are braiding their bluegrass roots with new threads of their own design, bringing together country, soul, and other contemporary influences to create an unapologetic hybrid that is old as the hills but fresh as the morning dew. The band is celebrating two new releases on Rounder Records. "Reckless" is the bands eagerly anticipated follow-up to their highly acclaimed self-titled debut. The band is also featured on the movie soundtrack for "Get Low" which stars Robert Duvall and Bill Murray.   MOLLY ANDREWS is recognized as one of the finest interpreters of southern Appalachian music and varied genres. Her lineage trails deep into pre-revolutionary southwest Virginia, hence a natural affinity for the old songs. Born a coal miners granddaughter in Bluefield, West Virginia, she uses combination of intuition and versatility as an a capella and interpretive singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. As the late Mike Seeger put it, "She's one of my very most favorite ballad singers." Her most recent solo recording, Bird On A Briar, is slated for release in early 2011.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 605: Punch Brothers and The Chaplin Sisters</title>
                    <description>PUNCH BROTHERS return the WoodSongs stage with a brand CD on Nonesuch Records called "Antifogmatic." Led by mandolinist Chris Thile (founding member of Nickel Creek), the band's second CD showcases the collaborative power of this virtuosic, genre-blurring combo. The Punch Brothers' line-up includes some of the most impressive and widely respected musicians performing today: Chris Eldridge (guitar), Paul Kowert (bass), Noam Pikelny (banjo), and Gabe Witcher (fiddle). In fact, Noam Pikelny just won the first annual Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass. THE CHAPIN SISTERS are singing and songwriting sisters who have been performing since 2004. Lily and Abigail (daughters of veteran singer/songwriter Tom Chapin and nieces of famed folk singer Harry Chapin) are known for pristine harmonies and haunting melodies that have gained comparisons to sister acts of old and Appalachian family groups, yet their songs and arrangements have a very contemporary feel, with elements of pop, blues and psychedelic rock.</description>

                    <description>JOHN JACOB NILES is considered one of our nation's most influential musicians. This Kentucky native is called the "Dean of American Balladeers" and Niles's dedication to the folk music tradition lives on in generations of folk revival artists such as Bob Dylan, Jean Ritchie, Joan Baez, and Oscar Brand. At the age of sixteen Niles wrote one of his most enduring tunes, "Go 'Way from My Window," basing it on a song fragment from a black farm worker. This iconic song has been performed by folk artists ever since and may even have inspired the opening line of Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe." As a composer and balladeer, Niles drew inspiration from the deep well of traditional Appalachian and African American folk songs. The show will feature Dr. RON PEN, associate professor of music and director of the John Jacob Niles Center for American Music and the Appalachian Studies Program, who just published the first full-length biography of Niles called I Wonder as I Wander: The Life of John Jacob Niles. Other artists performing on the show include: The Reel World String Band, The Niles String Quartet, Carla Gover, Dennis Bender &amp; vocalist Monica Dewey.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 603: &#160;Guy Mendilow Band&#160;and Still on the Hill</title>
                    <description>GUY MENDILOW BAND delivers a delightful, international blend of Israeli, Middle-Eastern, Sephardi and Blues and performs in Hebrew, Arabic, Ladino, Portuguese and English. The five members of the Guy Mendilow Band create intricate textures with berimbaus, percussion, jaw harps that would make beat-boxers' jaws drop, and Mendilow's award-winning overtone singing. The band's latest CD is "Skyland."   STILL ON THE HILL is the folkgrass duo from Arkansas, Kelly Mulhollan and Donna Stjerna. This duo uses traditional instruments from their home in the Ozarks (mandolin, banjo, fiddle, guitar, harmonica and scrub board) as well as other exotic offerings (Moon guitar from Japan, African Mbira, and Tenor Ukulele) to create a kaleidoscope of musical color and texture. They have been voted "Best Folk Band" in the Ozarks for several years running, and the mayor of their town, Fayetteville, Arkansas, proclaimed Dec. 20th Still on the Hill Day for all the work the duo does in community service. "Mouthpeace" is their newest release.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 602: &#160;Mollie O'Brien &amp; Rich Moore&#160; and Gary Bennett&#160;</title>
                    <description>MOLLIE O’BRIEN &amp; RICH MOORE have made music for over 30 years. After their youngest daughter went to college, they started to do some dates together which lead to the release of their debut studio album called &amp;ldquo;Saints &amp; Sinners.” Mollie took her first step into the public eye with her brother, Tim O’Brien, and has one of the most remarkable voices in roots music. Mollie shared a Grammy with a stellar bunch of bluegrass collaborators on True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe (Sugar Hill). Rich grew up in Philadelphia with a musical family. He is well-known and well-loved in Colorado's acoustic music family and has lived and performed here for over 25 years. He made his reputation in recent years as the rhythmic bedrock for Pete Wernick's Live Five. He is guitarist of choice for folk legend Tom Paxton, who invariably requests Moore as a sideman for his Colorado shows.GARY BENNETT is a founding member of the critically acclaimed country music band BR549, who recorded five well-received albums, received three Grammy nominations and was hailed by music industry trade magazine Billboard as having single-handedly revived the soul of country music in Nashville. During Gary's tenure, the band sold over 500,000 albums and toured the world, headlining shows as well as opening for such artists as Bob Dylan, George Jones, Merle Haggard, the Black Crowes and Brian Setzer. BR549 was also voted "Best Country Group" in 1996 by Rolling Stone magazine. Gary is about to release his second full length solo album and will be performing with all-star band filled with some Nashville’s top players.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 598: Luckas Nelson and Promise of the Real and Jubal's Kin</title>
                    <description>LUKAS NELSON and PROMISE OF THE REAL is a four-man rock and roots powerhouse that has rapidly made a name for themselves since early last year. Guitarist, singer and songwriter Lukas Nelson was born in Austin, Texas, raised on his father Willie Nelson’s famed Honeysuckle Rose bus, and now based out of Venice Beach, California. The 21-year-old Nelson is no stranger to the road, with his first trip on the bus at 5 weeks old on a tour by The Highwaymen (the supergroup featuring his father, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson). The band has released a well-received EP, Brando’s Paradise Sessions and plans to release a full album in the not too distant future. The band will be performing an &amp;ldquo;unplugged” type of set on WoodSongs. 

JUBAL'S KIN is a young, Florida based family that's a blend of rompin' old time, bluegrass, folk covers and roots originals. The band is anchored by Roger on acoustic guitar, a three time Florida Old-Time Music Championship winner, and Gailanne, the current Florida &amp; Tennessee Grand Champion Old Time Fiddler, on fiddle and clawhammer banjo, with brother Jeffrey recently joining them to hold down the groove on acoustic bass. They will be performing material from their self-titled debut CD.</description>

                    <description>PETER ROWAN Bluegrass Band, Peter is a legendary bluegrass songwriter with a career spanning over five decades. He's a Grammy-award winner and five-time Grammy nominee. From his early years playing with bluegrass patriarch Bill Monroe, and following his stint in Old &amp; In the Way with Jerry Garcia and subsequent breakout as both a solo performer and bandleader, Rowan has built a devoted, international fan base through his continuous stream of original recordings, collaborative projects, and constant touring. His time-honored compositions include songs such as "Panama Red," a subsequent hit for the New Riders of the Purple Sage, "Moonlight Midnight", " In The Land of the Navajo" and "Lonesome L.A. Cowboy." Peter will be backed by his veteran touring Bluegrass Band featuring Jody Stecher, Keith Little, and Paul Knight.

                    <title>Woodsongs 595: Songs of Water and Megan McCormick</title>
                    <description>SONGS OF WATER is an adventurous and exciting band from North Carolina. Their bluegrass textures driven by the uncommon use of the Appalachian hammered dulcimer, followed by the brooding foundation of heavy percussion makes their music rich and passionate. With band leader Stephen Roach’s world music influence, the classical background of violinist Marta Richardson, the Spanish infused guitar of co-founder Jason Windsor, and multi-instrumentation of Greg Willette, Luke Skaggs and Michael Pritchard, Songs of Water creates a unique sound that reaches beyond the common.

MEGAN McCORMICK is a 23-year-old Nashville-based singer, songwriter and guitarist with her roots in bluegrass and her heart in rock. The sexy, raw, heavy, beautiful rock &amp; roll of her debut CD, &amp;ldquo;Honest Words” really caught our attention. Megan grew up listening to the likes of Bonnie Raitt and Steely Dan, but her most essential influences were from her musical family in Alaska. McCormick has won two International Bluegrass Music Association awards for Recorded Event of the Year in 2006 (&amp;ldquo;Back To The Well”) and again in 2009 (&amp;ldquo;Proud To Be A Daughter of Bluegrass”) .This past year, she also landed her song, &amp;ldquo;Bullseye”, in the Emmy-Award nominated film, Prayers for Bobby, featuring Sigourney Weaver.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 593: Wanda Jackson and Billy Bragg</title>
                    <description>WANDA JACKSON is the First Lady of Rockabilly and America's first female Rock and Roll singer. When Jackson first toured in 1955 and 1956, she was placed on a bill with none other than Elvis Presley. The two hit it off almost immediately. Jackson said it was Presley, along with her father, who encouraged her to sing rockabilly. In 2009 Wanda was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, and Bruce Springsteen were just a few of the high-profile artists that encouraged the Hall to induct the Queen of Rock over the last few years. Wanda made a huge comeback a few years ago with the release of "Heart Trouble". An album that included cool collaborations with such artists as Elvis Costello, Dave Alvin, &amp; the Cramps. With her career as hot as ever, she set to release another new album that Jack White of the White Stripes produced via Jack's Third Man Records.

BILLY BRAGG is a revered folksinger and songwriter from England and recently described by The Times newspaper as a "national treasure" in America as well. In the two decades Bragg has become the most stalwart guardian of the dissenting tradition of the country's political, cultural and social history. It's a legacy that's brought Bragg fans the world over as an artist with a keen sense of political activism as well as a way with a pop hook, all informed with a sense of humanity and humor. His two albums collaboration with Wilco filled with unfinished Woody Guthrie songs were both nominated for Grammy Awards. Billy's latest CD is "Mr. Love &amp; Justice."</description>

                    <description>RAUL MALO is best known as the founder and front man of Grammy-winning, multi-platinum band the Mavericks. Born in Miami of Cuban parents, he made his mark in the country music world and then drifted into the Latin and jazz arenas via rock n roll. Considered to be one of the finest singers in the world, Raul Malo has always crossed cultures and blurred musical boundaries, breaking new ground with his distinctive balance of vintage sound and contemporary attitude. Raul is celebrating his first album of original material in seven year called "Lucky One" on Fantasy Records.

BRIGID KAELIN has played her accordion, musical saw, and sung with the likes of Elvis Costello and Garrison Keillor, but it's her original "alt-country cabaret" music that has charmed audiences worldwide. Recently, she was voted "Best Singer/Songwriter" in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, and she'll be departing for her fourth European tour this October. Brigid's latest album, West 28th Street, is part country, part vaudeville, and all Americana.</description>

He has cultivated a devout fan base from his days of fronting seminal hardcore trio Heart Attack and infamous glam punks D Generation to the seven years on the road as a solo artist. He’d shared stages with everyone from The White Stripes to Counting Crows, The Hold Steady to Lucinda Williams. His duet from his last CD with Bruce Springsteen for &amp;ldquo;Broken Radio” was a big hit on YouTube. His latest CD, Love It To Life , encompasses Jesse roots and evolution as an artist. The CD features his long time partner in crime Ryan Adams.

THE VESPERS are two sets of sibling duos: Callie and Phoebe Cryar, and Taylor and Bruno Jones. They came together purely by spontaneous collision, the two pairs both completely immersed in their own separate projects. The girls were playing acoustic instruments and singing ghostly harmonies to folk songs they had written, and the boys were playing rock and roll. What began as a &amp;ldquo;let’s jam and see if we can learn this and maybe play a few shows together” kind of situation soon turned into a full-blown summer of concentrated music. The band’s debut CD Tell Your Mama was recently released.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>JESSE MALIN is hardcore/punk veteran from NYC turned folk singer-songwriter. He has cultivated a devout fan base from his days of fronting seminal hardcore trio Heart Attack and infamous glam punks D Generation to the seven years on the road as a solo artist. He’d shared stages with everyone from The White Stripes to Counting Crows, The Hold Steady to Lucinda Williams.

                    <title>Woodsongs 590: Beth McKee and Cedric Watson &#160;&#160;</title>
                    <description>BETH McKEE is a Southern singer/songwriter/pianist/accordion player. A former member of the popular New Orleans country-cajun group Evangeline (MCA Records) McKee toured extensively behind two critically acclaimed albums. L.A. Weekly raved Beth’s piano is &amp;ldquo;worthy of some Jerry Lee Lewis arson.” Long before her career took off nationally, the Mississippi native played piano in church. She played blues on the chitlin’ circuit from steamy juke joints to muddy hog farms, and emerged as a respected player on the New Orleans, Austin and Nashville music scenes. In 2010, the self-released I’m That Way displays all those southern roots fusing to formulate her swampy and soulful musical identity. 

CEDRIC WATSON is one of the most noted young talents to emerge in Cajun or Creole music in the past few years. This Grammy nominated artist is a fiddler, vocalist, accordionist and songwriter of seemingly unlimited potential. Born in 1983, Cedric grew up in San Felipe, Texas surrounded by the sounds of blues, old soul, country and zydeco. Unlike his hip-hop focused peers, Cedric was drawn to the old-style French songs of Southwest Louisiana and the greater Houston area. He soon made his way to Lafayette, LA where he was enthusiastically accepted into the musical community and immediately recognized as an important participant in the continuity of Creole music. Cedric will be performing on WoodSongs with his band Bijou Creole.</description>

                    <description>MUNNELLY is one of the hottest bands on the traditional Celtic music scene. Led by button accordion virtuoso David Munnelly, who came to attention in his early twenties touring and recording with The Chieftains, the band has exploded onto the Irish music stage with their peerless playing, irrepressible enthusiasm, and unique musical style. Their style of playing has been called a living link between two centuries of Rural Irish culture and the Golden Age of Irish American music of the 1920's &amp; 1930's.

BUTCH ROSS brings a &amp;ldquo;rock n roll attitude” to the traditional mountain dulcimer. Playing the dulcimer standing up like a guitar and strung backwards, he’ll play everything from Beatles tunes to &amp;ldquo;Stairway to Heaven” to the more traditional mountain tunes. Butch was given a mountain dulcimer for his birthday a few years ago, at the time the regionally touring singer/songwriter had no idea of the impact the instrument would have on his career.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 588: Celebration of the Ukulele featuring Brittni Paiva&#160;and Victoria Vox&#160;&#160;</title>
                    <description>BRITTNI PAIVA is already the preeminent female ukulele player from Hawaii. At 21 years of age, she's an award-winning multi-instrumentalist whose sound and concept are influenced by jazz, rock, flamenco, and classical music as well as world music from Brazil, Japan, and elsewhere. Brittni and her ukulele are a brilliant match: Both are humble in nature, small in size, and very powerful with proper delivery. Brittni’s new CD is titled Four Strings: The Fire Within.

VICTORIA VOX and her ukulele return to the WoodSongs Stage with a brand new CD. Known as a pioneer for singer/songwriters in the growing ukulele genre, Victoria Vox has been writing and performing songs across the country about whatever tickles her tires. Refreshingly modern and innovative, the award-winning vocalist and songwriter lives in Baltimore, and tours 130+ shows a year Paris to Honolulu. The new album, Exact Change was financed by her fans. It’s a blend of traditional roots and blues, pop-rock sensibility and a distinct worldly flair.</description>

                    <description>TIFT MERRITT has already produced an impressive body of work and earned a passionate, dedicated audience. A North Carolina native, Tift began her music career in the clubs in Chapel Hill. Though she loves her new home in New York City, she still considers North Carolina home. Her live performances, both with her band and on her own, are similarly riveting. Tift's stellar album "See You On The Moon" is a most important step forward in a remarkable artistic journey that continues to search, penetrate, and surprise.

DANGERMUFFIN is a sand-blasted, rough-around-the-edges trio that casts a fresh perspective on American roots music. Based in Folly Beach, SC, the group is anchored by the thought-provoking lyrical wit of songwriter Dan Lotti, Nashville-veteran percussionist Steven Sandifer and lead guitarist Mike Sivilli. Accolades include winning Relix Magazine’s JamOff! competition for emerging bands and the reader-voted Best House Band in the Charleston City Paper’s Best Of 2009. Dangermuffin brings a new level of groove to Americana music — a punchy, folk-jam pastry for the sweet-toothed soul of the South. Their new CD is "Moonscapes" on released on Dualtone.</description>

                    <description>PETER KARP &amp; SUE FOLEY are two the of the finest roots artists working today and have teamed up for an incredible new project called "He Said - She Said." Peter is a gifted troubadour, a master songsmith with an art for spinning true-to-life emotions, humor, and candor. Sue was born to a working class family and spent her early childhood moving from Canadian town to town with her mother. After moving back to Canada Sue won the prestigious Juno award for her critically acclaimed CD "Love Coming Down." Their project project is based around a correspondence the two shared through letters that were written over a year period. Those letters became their songs.

THE ROCKRIDGE BROTHERS are a bluegrass and old-time band of young musicians from Stockholm, Sweden that perform high energy hillbilly style mountain music. The band got together to make a bluegrass soundtrack for an animated movie. Right away they felt the need to make something more out of this newly formed combo. Pooling their different musical experiences, ranging from country to punk, they found common ground in old time string music Since that time the Rockridge Brothers have been touring Europe and USA and have released two CDs including their latest "Rockridge Hollerin'</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 584: Darrell Scott&#160;and Evie Ladin&#160;</title>
                    <description>DARRELL SCOTT is a songwriter, acclaimed performer and recording artist. As a songwriter, he's contributed a string of hits that reads like a list of the best modern country music has to offer. There's the Grammy Award winning "Long Time Gone" and "Heartbreak Town," both top hits for the Dixie Chicks. "Great Day to be Alive" helped Travis Tritt complete his comeback; "Born to Fly" was a No. 1 hit for Sara Evans, while "Family Tree" was successful for Darryl Worley and "When No One's Around" extended Garth Brooks' run. Darrell returns to WoodSongs with a brand new double CD "A Crooked Road" before he hits the road for a string of dates with Robert Plant (yes, the Led Zepplin guy).

EVIE LADIN plays old-time banjo. Listen and you can hear the whomp and jive of the genre's Appalachian heritage. You also hear the instrument's African roots. Now listen to Evie's genteel voice and lyrics and you hear the push and pull of life, you hear real, contemporary stories. Evie is known to music fans as a driving force behind San Francisco's all-gal old-time group the Stairwell Sisters. Based in Oakland, CA, is has just released her debut CD "Float Downstream."</description>

                    <description>JOHN LEE HOOKER JR. is the son of the great John Lee Hooker. He was exposed to the life of the blues by touring alongside his dad throughout his teens. Unfortunately, while living the "life of a bluesman" he succumbed to the demons that surround it, derailing his musical career for many, many years. With the support of his family and friends, and a crew of talented musicians who never ceased to believe in him, Jr. Hooker finally found his own inner muse, making music that expresses the depth of emotion he has experienced in his personal life. Has received 2 Grammy nominations and several major blues awards. His latest CD is &amp;ldquo;Live in Istanbul Turkey.” 

TIERRA NEGRA &amp; MURIEL ANDERSON are three brilliant guitarists that met in a castle in Germany. In the world of modern Flamenco, few artists have attained the heights of thee two German guitarists known in Europe as &amp;ldquo;Tierra Negra.” The duo are often cited as the protagonists of Flamenco Nuevo. A WoodSongs favorite, Muriel is widely respected as one of the world’s foremost fingerstyle guitarists and harp-guitarists and is the first woman to have won the National Fingerpicking Guitar Championship. This trio has come together in an exciting CD titled &amp;ldquo;New World Flamenco.”</description>

                    <description>CHERRYHOLMES return to bluegrass as the reigning &amp;ldquo;First family of Bluegrass.” They have stormed to the top of the music world since winning the 2005 IBMA Award for Entertainer of the Year. As little as 10 years ago, the band itself didn’t exist, and half of its youthful members hadn’t even picked up instruments yet. With four GRAMMY nominations to date, the fourth album, &amp;ldquo;Cherryholmes IV Common Threads” on Skaggs Family Records, brings this talented family back to the WoodSongs stage.

KENNY WHITE is an explosive piano player, a soulful singer-songwriting and a Grammy nominated producer. He worked with artists like Gladys Knight, Linda Ronstadt, Dwight Yoakam, Ricky Skaggs, Kim Carnes Felix Cavaliere, Dobie Gray and Aaron Neville among many others. His relationships with Marc Cohn and Shawn Colvin led to his producing Colvin’s Grammy-nominated, &amp;ldquo;I Don’t Know Why” and to his involvement in Cohn’s eponymous platinum debut record. Kenny signed to Judy Collins Wildflower Records and has just released&amp;ldquo;Comfort in the Static,” his long-awaited newest release.</description>

An intensely talented musician from Charlottesville, Virginia, his distinct sound is an evolution of his work with&amp;ldquo;scum billy” band and time spent playing in the New York Subway system. From the Mountaintop removal protests of West Virginia to the pubs of Belfast and through Holland and back again, these days O’kane’s soulful war cry can be heard for miles., 

BECKY SCHLEGEL’s music is a gentle mix of folk, bluegrass and country. Becky has come a long way from the Kimball, South Dakota farm of her youth. She began her musical career at the age of five, and began performing in her mother’s band when she was in the 8th grade. She moved to Minnesota in 1993 and jumped headfirst into the vibrant Twin Cities music scene, where she won numerous awards and appeared several times on &amp;ldquo;A Prairie Home Companion.” She is celebrating the release of her new CD called &amp;ldquo;Dandelion.”</description>

                    <description>JANIVA MAGNESS returns to the WoodSongs stage as the reigning 2009 Blues Music Entertainer of the Year, only the second woman ever to win this award. Although Magness is now a bona fide blues star, her rise to the top was far from easy. She has been performing for almost three decades, logging thousands of miles on the road and appearing 150 nights a year at clubs, theaters and festivals all over the world. Janiva and her full band will be supporting her latest CD on Alligator Records called &amp;ldquo;The Devil Is An Angel Too.”

CROOKED STILL has established themselves as &amp;ldquo;the most important folk group to emerge from Boston since the early ‘60s” (The Boston Globe).

Janiva and her full band will be supporting her latest CD on Alligator Records called “The Devil Is An Angel Too.”

Since their last WoodSongs appearance, the quintet became five with the addition of fiddler Brittany Haas and Tristan Clarridge on cello and second fiddle and opened up a new musical chapter for the band.

                    <description>The CALIFORNIA GUITAR TRIO (CGT) is Bert Lams from Belgium, Hideyo Moriya from Japan, and Paul Richards from Utah. Together, their technical wizardry is breathtaking, as is the wide range of instrumental music the group renders... everything from unique originals to dazzling, cleverly-arranged interpretations of jazz, classical music, and surf rock. The members of CGT met while studying under Robert Fripp and performing with Fripp's "League of Crafty Guitarists." In 1995, CGT toured worldwide with King Crimson. CGT’s new CD is called Andromeda.

PATTY LARKIN has been redefining the boundaries of folk-urban pop music for 25 years with her inventive guitar wizardry and uncompromising vocals and lyrics. Her songs run from impressionistic poetry to witty wordplay. In 2010, Patty Larkin releases a collectible collection of 25 love songs in celebration of 25 years in the recording industry. Here Patty has reworked 25 of her favorite songs in an acoustic, &amp;ldquo;unplugged” release, joined by friends along the way.</description>

QUEBE SISTERS BAND is an American fiddle western swing group from Fort Worth, Texas. The band began their musical journey in 1998 when the three sisters started taking fiddle lessons. Shortly thereafter, the girls began entering fiddle contests and had success early on; winning several State, regional and National fiddle championships. Add the swinging rhythm guitar of World Champion fiddler Joey McKenzie and the upright bass of Drew Phelps, and the Quebe Sisters Band becomes a force of nature. Recently named Group of the Year by the Academy of Western Artists and recipient of the Crescendo Award by the Western Music Association, as well as nominations for Country group of the year by both the Dallas Observer and Ft. Worth Weekly, the QSB is performing coast to coast in support of their latest cd, &amp;ldquo;Timeless.”</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 570: The Dust Busters and Moreland&amp;Arbuckle</title>
                    <description>THE DUST BUSTERS are an old-time string band based out of Brooklyn, New York. They strive to integrate a wide range of old-time songs, ballads, fiddle tunes and jug band blues into every performance, infused with the old-time feeling and freewheelin’ high energy that characterized early string bands. They are influenced and inspired by the direct fusion of Scots-Irish and African music that took place in Appalachia, the Western states and the Deep South from the earliest colonial times through the Second World War. The Dust Busters have recorded their first album, currently available for sale only at live shows.

MORELAND &amp; ARBUCKLE have spent nearly a decade exploring American roots music. Guitarist Aaron Moreland and harpist/vocalist Dustin Arbuckle with help from the driving beat of drummer Brad Horner have forged a relentless and haunting sound that merges Delta blues, folk, rock, traditional country, and soul. In addition to the more typical Telecaster and Les Paul guitars, Moreland arsenal also includes a hand-crafted instrument consisting of four strings stretched across a cigar box. Moreland &amp; Arbuckle make their debut on Telarc International with the release of &amp;ldquo;Flood.”</description>

                    <description>MADISON VIOLET are a Toronto based duo, consisting of Lisa MacIsaac (vocals, guitar, fiddle, mandolin) and Brenley MacEachern (vocals, guitar, banjo, harmonica). Together, they've been touring the globe non-stop for 9 years. The duo has just released their 3rd album No Fool For Trying. It’s been described as a cross between a rootsy Gillian Welch, gritty Steve Earle and bluegrassy Alison Krauss, loaded with harmonies, lots of stringed instruments and beautiful lyrics. The band also just won Vocal Group of the Year' at the Canadian Folk Music Awards.

TIME FOR THREE is a groundbreaking, category-shattering roots music trio. What started as a trio of musicians who played together for fun while students at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute for Music evolved into Time for Three, or Tf3 for short. Tf3 has performed on many of the nation's impressive stages, including the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and Joe's Pub in New York. They have performed their own original works with over 60 orchestras. The group recorded will release its third CD, "3 Fervent Travelers."</description>

                    <description>OSCAR BRAND is one of the last remaining fathers of North American Folk Music. Oscar, a native of Winnipeg, who recently released his 100th record album, will be celebrating his 90th Birthday. He has over 70 years as a performer, and the 65th Anniversary of his weekly radio show Folksong Festival in 2010 (the only radio show in the USA who dared feature blacklisted folk singers during the McCarthy era). Just some of the folk artists who regularly appeared on Oscar’s radio show in the 1940s included Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White (and Josh, Jr.), Paul Robeson, Burl Ives, Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee and Pete Seeger; He has written eleven books on folk music, his 1952 million selling song "A Guy is a Guy" was Song of the Year, and as co-founder (with Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn and Frank Sinatra) and Curator of the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, and is one of the last three remaining performing artists to have shared the stage with Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Burl Ives and Paul Robeson (along with Pete Seeger and Josh White, Jr.). Oscar is also an EMMY and 2 time Peabody Award star of television and radio and a founder of Sesame Street. WoodSongs is very proud to welcome this folk icon giant to our stage for a celebration of Oscar's historic musical legacy. JOSH WHITE JR returns to the WoodSongs stage celebrating the 65th year of his storied career with two brand new releases. His father, Josh White, was the ground-breaking African-American pioneer in many fields: as the first folk and blues artist and the first black man to have a million selling record; first to give a White House Command Performance; first folk and blues artist to perform in a nightclub, first to make a national solo concert tour of America; the first to tour internationally; and along with Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie, the first to be honored with a US Postage Stamp. In addition to his concerts and CDs, Josh is a TONY award winning actor. His current CD "By Request" was released in 2009, and he has new two releases,"Tuning the Blues" and "Live at the Raven Gallery 1978-1979," coming out in early 2010.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>OSCAR BRAND is one of the last remaining fathers of North American Folk Music. Oscar, a native of Winnipeg, who recently released his 100th record album, will be celebrating his 90th Birthday. He has over 70 years as a performer, and the 65th Anniversary of his weekly radio show Folksong Festival in 2010 (the only radio show in the USA who dared feature blacklisted folk singers during the McCarthy era). Just some of the folk artists who regularly appeared on Oscar’s radio show in the 1940s included Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White (and Josh, Jr.), Paul Robeson, Burl Ives, Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee and Pete Seeger; He has written eleven books on folk music, his 1952 million selling song "A Guy is a Guy" was Song of the Year, and as co-founder (with Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn and Frank Sinatra) and Curator of the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame, and is one of the last three remaining performing artists to have shared the stage with Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Burl Ives and Paul Robeson (along with Pete Seeger and Josh White, Jr.). Oscar is also an EMMY and 2 time Peabody Award star of television and radio and a founder of Sesame Street. WoodSongs is very proud to welcome this folk icon giant to our stage for a celebration of Oscar's historic musical legacy. JOSH WHITE JR returns to the WoodSongs stage celebrating the 65th year of his storied career with two brand new releases. His father, Josh White, was the ground-breaking African-American pioneer in many fields: as the first folk and blues artist and the first black man to have a million selling record; first to give a White House Command Performance; first folk and blues artist to perform in a nightclub, first to make a national solo concert tour of America; the first to tour internationally; and along with Leadbelly and Woody Guthrie, the first to be honored with a US Postage Stamp. In addition to his concerts and CDs, Josh is a TONY award winning actor. His current CD "By Request" was released in 2009, and he has new two releases,"Tuning the Blues" and "Live at the Raven Gallery 1978-1979," coming out in early 2010.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 550:Battlefield Band&#160;and Pauly Zarb&#160;</title>
                    <description>BATTLEFIELD BAND from Scotland has been performing on the international scene for more than three decades, and is one of the premier Celtic bands in the world. Founded in 1969 and named after the ‘Battlefield’ area of Glasgow, the band pioneered the integration of bagpipes with fiddle, keyboards, guitar and voice, mixing the old songs and tunes with new self-penned material, playing them on a unique fusion of ancient and modern instruments. PAULY ZARB is originally from Australia. His home base is now Bardstown, KY while traveling the country performing his rootsy musical blend.  His music combines keyboards, drums, hi-hat, guitar, flute, pan pipes, tin whistles, accordion, harmonica, digerridoo ... often all in the same song. He and his brother received the Best Folk Album award at the Queensland Sunny Music Awards in 2001.</description>

                    <title>Woodsongs 548: Mark O'Connor &amp; The Appalachia Waltz Trio and special surprise guest Tommy Emmanuel</title>
                    <description>MARK O’CONNOR is a multi-Grammy-winning violinist and composer who is widely recognized as one of the most gifted contemporary composers in America, and one of the brightest talents of his generation. He's studied and recorded with some of the 20th Century's greatest musicians, including Stephane Grappeli, Benny Thomasson, and Yo Yo Ma. Along the way, between these many marvelous musical extremes, Mark absorbed knowledge and influence from the multitude of musical styles and genres he studied. Now he has melded and shaped these influences into a new American Classical music, and is perpetuating his vision of an American School of string playing. Tommy Emmanuel is one of Australia's most respected musicians. The legendary guitarist has a professional career that spans almost five decades and continues to intersect with some of the finest musicians throughout the world. Guitar legend Chet Atkins was one of the first to inspire Emmanuel to try this "fingerpicker" style as a child. Decades later, Atkins himself became one of Emmanuel's biggest fans.</description>

                    <description>BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY bring their bib-band fusion of classic American sounds from jazz, swing, to Dixieland to the WoodSongs Stage for one incredible night of music. Since their arrival on the music scene in 1993 in a legendary residency at Los Angeles’ Brown Derby nightclub, BBVD’s irresistible live show and aggressive, musically perceptive approach has proven them over time to be the singular standout among the numerous bands that launched the Nineties swing revival. ZACH BROCK is a Lexington native that received a global musical education in Chicago and now resides in NYC. He has been lionized as "the great bright hope for jazz violin" by the Chicago Tribune. His wide-ranging professional accomplishments place him in the company of today's leading "indie jazz" innovators. Zach will be performing solo-violin on this very special, adventurous WoodSongs broadcast.</description>

                    <description>CHUCK McCABE is a master storyteller in the tradition of the great folk troubadours. A vein of humor and a theme of respect run through McCabe’s distinctly award winning songwriting. His delivery demonstrates an understated elegance that is a rare find among performers especially those who cross the lines between wit and wisdom. Chuck's latest CD is "Creatures of Habit." MITCH BARRETT is one of Kentucky’s most sought-after and talented singer songwriter sons. His approach to lyrical storytelling is true ‘Americana’, rooted in authentic experience, not just a record label’s genre. Mitch’s music draws from his Appalachian heritage and the values it instilled: agrarian work ethic, simple living, the importance of family and celebrating the joys and the struggles of everyday life through music and song. .</description>

                    <description>RAY BONNEVILLE is a distinctive artist, a man who cooks up a deep blues groove, blending a unique percussive electric guitar style, a weathered voice, and soulful rack harmonica into image provoking songs that can be believed. Born in Canada, he moved to the Boston area in his early teens where he started playing guitar and harmonica. His last 30 or so years have seen him seeking adventure and playing music throughout the world. Being a dual citizen allows him the freedom to live between Montreal Canada, and Austin Texas.  THOSE DARLINS are a trio of young women based out of Murfreesboro, TN. They are part Carter Family and part Ramones. The unrelated band mates are Kelley Darlin, the group's bassist, Jessi Darlin, who plays guitar, and Nikki Darlin, on baritone ukulele.

                    <itunes:summary>RAY BONNEVILLE is a distinctive artist, a man who cooks up a deep blues groove, blending a unique percussive electric guitar style, a weathered voice, and soulful rack harmonica into image provoking songs that can be believed. Born in Canada, he moved to the Boston area in his early teens where he started playing guitar and harmonica. His last 30 or so years have seen him seeking adventure and playing music throughout the world. Being a dual citizen allows him the freedom to live between Montreal Canada, and Austin Texas.  THOSE DARLINS are a trio of young women based out of Murfreesboro, TN. They are part Carter Family and part Ramones. The unrelated band mates are Kelley Darlin, the group's bassist, Jessi Darlin, who plays guitar, and Nikki Darlin, on baritone ukulele. Sonically, they walk the line between traditional country and punk. As the NY Times put it, "This young country trio is a tangle of bare legs, cowboy boots and Southern sass."</itunes:summary>

                    <description>JAKE SHIMABUKURO returns to the WoodSongs stage for a one hour Special Event Broadcast. Jake is recognized as one of the world's most exciting and innovative ukulele players and composers. Born in Hawaii, Jake's mother gave him his first ukulele lesson when he was but four years old.

Playing jazz, blues, funk, classical, bluegrass, folk, flamenco, and rock, Jake's mission is to show everyone that the ukulele is capable of so much more than the traditional Hawaiian music - or corny showbiz routines -- many associate it with. ,</description>

                    <description>STEVE WARINER is a superstar of country music. His latest project is a tribute to his mentor and friend Chet Atkins. Steve first met Chet in 1977, who then quickly signed Steve to RCA Records. Steve will be the sole guest on WoodSongs and be playing material for his new CD Steve Wariner c. g. p., My Tribute to Chet Atkins along with a couple of Steve’s hits. Steve scored his first hit record in 1980 and thus began a career that has spanned three decades, 25 Albums released, 18 1's and millions of records sold. In 2009, he won his third Grammy (this one in collaboration with Brad Paisley). As an FYI, The abbreviation "c.g.p." stands for "Certified Guitar Player," a title that Chet would bestow on only four guitar pickers: Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles, the late Jerry Reed, and Steve Wariner.</description>

                    <description>BEAUSOLEIL bring their Grammy winning Cajun music to WoodSongs for a Special Event Broadcast. Since forming in 1975, BeauSoleil claimed their undisputed role as the most esteemed Cajun group in music. The band takes the rich Cajun traditions of Louisiana and artfully blend elements of zydeco, New Orleans jazz, Tex-Mex, country, blues and more into a satisfying musical recipe. From The Grand Ole Opry to Newport Folk, from concert hall to dance floor, the music of BeauSoleil continues to captivate audiences the world over. Yet, it all begins with the preservation of a sacred culture, the lifelong calling of fiddling frontman Michael Doucet. Their latest release and Yep Roc label debut Alligator Purse is not only a vibrant testament to BeauSoleil's healthy spirit but is easily their most adventuresome record yet.,</description>

That their first go-round as The Flatlanders in 1972 was completely rejected by the country music establishment is surprising in retrospect but, ultimately, poetic. That each went on to have formidable solo careers is a testament to their talent and determination. Add to this their diverse yet complimentary styles -Joe the street-wise rocker, Jimmie Dale the mystic with the classic country voice and Butch the cerebral folk singer - and you’ve got a story of one of the most extraordinary kinships in American musical history. It took these Flatlanders a mere three decades to release the sequel to their legendary debut. Their latest CD on New West Records is titled Hills &amp; Vallies.,</description>

                    <itunes:summary>ALMIRA FAWN is just eleven years old.

                    <title>Woodsongs 522: Samuel James and Shout Sister Shout</title>
                    <description>SAMUEL JAMES is a young master of fingerstyle, slide, banjo, harmonica, and piano and is not yet out of his twenties. With musical influences ranging from Skip James and Sonny Terry to Gus Cannon and Charley Patton, such understanding of pre-war blues is rarely embodied in the music of one person. SHOUT SISTER SHOUT is an old-time jazz unit, formed by Boston Music Award Winner Rachel Davis and roots band Steppin’ In It through a common love of 30s &amp; 40s jazz standards. The summer of 2006 found the two acts working at the same festivals, which led to joining each other for a classic tune by Nat King Cole or Billie Holiday during their respective sets.</description>

                    <description>KELLEIGH McKENZIE just received three Independent Music Award nominations, with her song "Gin" winning Best Americana Song, and she was named a winner in last fall’s Mountain Stage NewSong Contest. She delivers a captivating blend of folk, blues, old-time and rock with a uniquely urbane edge. She plucks and thumps out twist-filled tales on banjo and acoustic guitar, all while pounding along on her amplified stomp-box. SLIDE is an impressive, powerful Irish traditional music band from Dublin, Ireland. The high energy band is named after the liveliest and most exciting of the tune rhythms from the South of Ireland. Formed with an all-star line up of award winners, this rollicking band is living proof of how innovation need not compromise tradition. The Irish Times calls Slide "traditional musicians with attitude."</description>

Reared in the village of Greenwich in the gorgeously verdant countryside of upstate New York, Ketchum hails from a family where singing and playing music was part of the daily (and nightly) diet for generations. DAILEY &amp; VINCENT captured an unprecedented seven International Bluegrass Music Awards including the IBMA Entertainers of the Year. Jamie Dailey and Darrin Vincent are veterans of Bluegrass music having some twenty years experience between the two of them from long tenures with Bluegrass and Country legends Doyle Lawson and Ricky Skaggs.</description>

                    <description>JJ GREY was born and raised just outside of Jacksonville, Florida. Grey comes from a long tradition of Southern musical storytellers. Like the best of the great Southern writers, he fills his songs with details that are at once vivid and personal, political and universal.  THE DUHKS based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the band has been hailed by The New York Times as one of the artists at the forefront of the neo-folk movement. The band's spot-on fusion of traditional bluegrass, folk rock, Afro-Cuban jazz and soul have earned them a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Country Vocal Performance category as well as a Juno award in their native Canada.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>JJ GREY was born and raised just outside of Jacksonville, Florida. Grey comes from a long tradition of Southern musical storytellers. Like the best of the great Southern writers, he fills his songs with details that are at once vivid and personal, political and universal.  THE DUHKS based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the band has been hailed by The New York Times as one of the artists at the forefront of the neo-folk movement. The band's spot-on fusion of traditional bluegrass, folk rock, Afro-Cuban jazz and soul have earned them a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Country Vocal Performance category as well as a Juno award in their native Canada.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>SONYA KITCHELL songs are a true showcase for Kitchell's worldly voice, which, with its intimate tone and feathery falsetto, has earned her attention not only from critics, but also from one of the most respected figures in jazz: Herbie Hancock. The contemporary avant-rock trio band The Slip will be Sonya’s backing band for the show. DOUG MacLEOD is one of the last remaining bluesmen who learned from the old masters, lived the music, survived the life and carries forward that valuable tradition.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>SHAWN MULLINS is a songwriter based in Atlanta, GA that is best known for his 1998 single Lullaby which hit number one and was nominated for a Grammy. One of his favorite accomplishments was the decision of the Australian Olympic Team to use his song Shimmer as their anthem. He also holds a degree in music education from North Georgia College in Dahlonega, GA where he served in the U.S. Army. His latest CD honeydew was just released on Vanguard Records.
THE BISCUIT BURNERS offer a fresh approach to acoustic music with roots that date as far back as mountain music can reach. Based in Weaverville, NC, the band has quickly become one of the hottest acts in old-time music today. Their unique brand of fiery mountain music pulls from their respect of traditional mountain music, their love of bluegrass and classic country, and their appreciation of music from the far corners of the world. Their latest CD is titled Take Me Home.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Woodsongs 476: The SteelDrivers and Carrie Newcomer</title>
                    <description>THE STEELDRIVERS play what might be called bluegrass soul. Imagine a great bluegrass band playing with, say, Joe Cocker singing. You read right. The band is comprised of a group of veteran Nashville session players that have innumerable hits, cuts, and licks to their credit. They will be performing material from their self-titled debut CD on Rounder Records. 
CARRIE NEWCOMER returns to the WoodSongs stage to perform material from her latest release The Geography of Light, her 11th release, also on Rounder Records. A native of Bloomington, Indiana, this critically acclaimed singer/songwriter is considered one of the definitive voices of the heartland. She has been an artist, a teacher, a truck stop waitress, a single mother, an activist and writes and sings about the human condition with compassion and clarity.</description>

                    <description>THE TANNAHILL WEAVERS are one of Scotland's premier traditional bands. Named for the town's historic weaving industry and local poet laureate Robert Tannahill, the group has made an international name for its special brand of Scottish music, blending the beauty of traditional melodies with the power of modern rhythms.  LAMBCHOP is an alternative band based in Nashville. The unique, unclassifiable hybrid of country, soul, and jazz is a baroque beauty held together by the surreal lyrical wit and droll vocal presence of frontman Kurt Wagner. Their latest CD "OH" (Ohio) continues their tradition of releasing challenging, mold-breaking records.</description>

                    <description>JJ GREY was born and raised just outside of Jacksonville, Florida. Grey comes from a long tradition of Southern musical storytellers. Like the best of the great Southern writers, he fills his songs with details that are at once vivid and personal, political and universal.  THE DUHKS based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the band has been hailed by The New York Times as one of the artists at the forefront of the neo-folk movement. The band's spot-on fusion of traditional bluegrass, folk rock, Afro-Cuban jazz and soul have earned them a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Country Vocal Performance category as well as a Juno award in their native Canada.</description>
