Just how concerned should the conservative Moderates and Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt be?  Climate change is happening, but how will it affect Sweden? It turns out farming and forestry may not do so badly as the weather changes.  Should the Swedish Government be doing more to mark its disapproval of the military coup in Thailand?

And we`ve got the first of our interviews with candidates for next month`s European parliament elections. Producer: Dave Russell. Presenter: Frank Radosevich. Song: "Klapp Klapp" by Little Dragon.</description>

                    <description>Former industry minister Maud Olofsson will not appear before a parliamentary committee to answer questions about a disasterous purchase by the state-owned power company. A European politician says she has a solution to the deadlock over Sweden`s sex case against Julian Assange. A disarmament campaigner says nowadays, when she goes on the TV to argue for peace, people call her a traitor. And we hear the latest stamps from Sweden`s postal delivery service are selling like hot cakes, they feature Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</description>

                    <description>Today Swedish Radio correspondent Nils Horner was shot and killed this morning on a street in Afghanistan`s capital, Kabul. We hear from the head of Swedish Radio, from the person in charge of reporters` safety, and we also hear Nils himself, talking to us a couple of years ago, about the risks of the job. Then we`ll hear about the government`s latest proposal - a cash boost for the early school years that the opposition says is rather close to their own plans, and we also hear about changes in the way people work in Sweden, that some say means more stress. Producer: Markus Landén. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou</description>

                    <description>Russia`s intervention in the Ukraine has sparked a renewed debate about Sweden`s defence.  The EU parliament approves a directive to try to stop young people from smoking - but will it be enough?  The government has raised tax on alcohol, so why are the prize on some bottles of wine lower this week compared to last?  Shop owners who don`t offer access for the disabled may soon face criminal charges.  Young Swedes are no longer lazing around in front of the tv as they move to watch their favourite programmes online instead.  Presenter: Ulla Engberg  Music: Panetoz "Efter Solsken"</description>

                    <description>The centre-right government is usually a big fan of tax cuts but has this morning announced a range of tax rises on everyday items. Money is one of the reasons why Swedish piglets are being shipped off to be slaughtered in Poland. Some say this means worse treatment for the pigs, and harder times for Swedish farmers. Staying on food related issues, we hear from a researcher how your body may be affected by what your grandparents ate, or did not eat. And we finish with even older ancestors.

                    <description>Why only two out of ten reported cases of domestic violence in Sweden lead to a conviction.      It was supposed to ease the burden of the usual emergency number 112 - but have you even heard of 113 13?    Lunch at ten thirty? That`s what many of the nation`s school kids are having.    Scandinavian gender-neutral toy-catalogues causing a furore in France     And in Sweden, multi-storey houses made out of wood is coming back into fashion.

                    <description>Sweden has opened its first senior housing facility for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender people in central Stockholm.  The comet so many of us were hoping to be a blinder, might actually turn out to be a damp squib.  And then later in the programme we meet editor Malin Crona who tells us about her newspaper, 8 Sidor, written in easy to read Swedish.</description>

                    <description>We hear about changes in the law to keep documents from, for example, the European Union, more secret. There`s red faces at a major department store after they published offensive black faces in their catalogue. Some childrens books from the 1950s have been republished, and one swiftly pulled, because of some stoneage racism. We hear how children who face abuse and bullying are being divided up unfairly, based on what kind of names they`re called. And we take a walk outside to find some art that`s escaped the gallery. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou. Producer: Nathalie Rothchild.</description>

                    <description>Clashes between police and protesters outside Jokkmokk, where a mining company wants to drill for minerals. The Sami people calls it the most active colonisation of their area ever.    And on the island of Öland even the local council is against prospective drilling there - but it seems there is not much they can do to stop it.    Freedom of choice is supposed to help us find the right health centre - but how do we make that choice?     And, on the day when the bear hunt starts up north, we take a look at the state of this country`s carnivore population.</description>

Dangers of high-fat, low-carb diets, the right of public access versus commercial exploitation of nature. And where does freedom of religion  fit into the new school law?

                    <description>Stockholm Pride kicks off today, but many will be thinking of events across the Baltic at the parties and seminars. Sweden`s economy is still sluggish.

And we profile what would be a major Swedish city, if only the Swedes there lived in this country, London.</description>

                    <description>With three straight nights of riots spreading now across many Stockholm suburbs, we speak to a local campaigner who`s says in 35 years he`s never seen his area turned into a warzone like this before. We talk to a researcher about why certain areas have riots, and others don`t. Then we hear about some young people who`re hoping to become the next generation of inventors and business executives. Plus there`s two new names on the calendar of name days in Sweden. Is it even important to celebrate a name day? And we`ll have time to also hear about how bad strawberries are still dangerous. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou. Producer: Dave Russell.</description>

                    <description>We talk to someone whose job is to help people leave a life of organised crime behind. She helps them start a new life and escape possible reprisals. In the newspapers you can see that the status of teachers here has taken another knock, since it is reported that even poorly qualified students can get a place on a training course. The head of the teachers` union tells us that things have been getting worse, since the 1970s. We have a report on how people from the Roma community are still being sent back to Kosovo, despite fears they face persecution. And we hear about the winner of the world`s biggest prize for children`s books. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou. Producer: George Wood.</description>

The leader of Sweden`s Center Party has cut short her holiday, as some leading members protest against some new policy proposals. We talk to a grassroots member of the party. Do you think the Swedish trains are no good, suffering delays and cancellations when it starts to snow? Well this may be unfair - we hear that lots of other countries also have the same problems. And Swedes are spending millions to save the European eel, which risks being eaten into extinction. Presenter Loukas Christodoulou. Producer Gabriel Stein.</description>

And the authorities are concerned that many secondary schools, mostly private, aren’t fulfilling their responsibility to maintain libraries. </description>

                    <description>A report says that last year`s Afghanistan attack that killed a Swede was caused by the actions of agents working for the USA. Problems with the new system of de-regulated pharmacies; some people find it hard to get their prescriptions filled. Then it`s piracy - people are not just copying films and books, but also furniture. Following on from yesterday`s report, about a World War Two airman`s grave that is being looked after by a mysterious well-wisher, we hear about the son of the dead RAF man, and his search for the truth. And a new film about Swedish prime minister Olof Palme is out. We hear what it has to say about this man, who was loved, and hated as well, by Swedes. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou. Producer: Gabriel Stein.</description>

And a new film about Swedish prime minister Olof Palme is out. We hear what it has to say about this man, who was loved, and hated as well, by Swedes. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou. Producer: Gabriel Stein.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>Amnesty International has released its annual report and top of the list when it comes to Sweden`s offences is sending people back to Iraq.  As a mob of 60 teenagers pelt the police with stones and set a school alight in a Stockholm suburb, commentators ask, is it due to social exclusion? Or are we just talking about kids acting up?  And while the police try to keep things calm at home, Swedish peacekeepers abroad get a bit more attention in a new book.  Presenter: Ann McNab Törnkvist Producer: Tom Sullivan</description>

We ask an expert why twice as many people out of work are not getting any unemployed benefit; about 140,000 people. On Swedish parental leave, one particular reform has meant more men are taking time for their family. Organic farming seems to be specially good for strawberries.

                    <description>We have a Radio Sweden exclusive - speaking to the Belgian politician who says the two Swedes in Ethiopia will soon be pardoned. And we put questions to the government minister who`s had to retreat in the face of parliament`s opposition on sick pay. One of our reporters followed the trash trail, seeing what happens to the average Swede`s 16 kilos of electrical waste. Then we go to Tensta, to find out why this area is the site of one of the world`s top art galleries. And a report on the victory of the Swedish football team last night. Music: Timbuktu, Flickan och kråkan. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou.</description>

                    <description>This morning, parliament sunk its teeth into several contentious foreign policy issues. We speak with the foreign minister, Carl Bildt. Then we take a look at how Swedish companies behave in China, and further afield how shooting blood into space can help us on earth. We`ll get a proper update from the stars and the champagne of last night`s Grammy Awards, and as artists party, scientists keep a close eye on the Nobel Prize and ask if it`s too entangled with its corporate sponsors.</description>

                    <description>The number of people stuck outside the labour market for a longer period of time is on the rise. We speak with a person who's spent the past three years looking for work. And then a sociologist tells us how unemployment in your early 20's can come to haunt you. And if all that's too depressing for you on this Valentine`s Day, we hear from Swedish kids about love, and how it`s not just reserved for their peers. Then onto why Swedes and their families pay half of the taxes on carbon emissions, even though companies produce 80 percent of the pollution.</description>

                    <description>Police try to deal with a rise in deadly crime in Malmo.  The pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca is cutting over a thousand jobs.

                    <description>The ailing Social Democrat party goes back to its root by turning to a metal union heavyweight for leadership. While Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt stepped out of the media shadow and yesterday took questions directly from the public on air. And as holocaust remembrance day is honoured in Sweden by the royal family and a visiting Kofi Annan, we speak with a woman who survived the genocide and later moved to Sweden with her sister. Job prospects are tough, especially for the young, unless you have special competence, or are prepared to head to the north.</description>

                    <description>Weekly roundup: We speak with the Left Party`s newly elected leader Jonas Sjöstedt. The Health and Welfare Board says there are 4,000 more homeless people now than in 2005. How the debate over privately run but state financed elderly care is continuing into 2012. We also speak with Anne Skånér, who was abused as a child and now heads up "Society`s Stepchildren". Plus an interview with Joachim Östlund, a history researcher, about Sweden`s role in the slave trade. And finally: last year Ericsson and Sony broke up, meaning that there are now no Ericsson telephones on the market for the first time in over 130 years.</description>

                    <description>In 2012, which political parties are winning and who are losing would-be-voters?  In central Stockholm some Swedes are voting with their feet.

                    <description>---BSK: The government presents a cautious budget for next year, preparing flood walls for when it may get worse.

Police ignored more than 6,000 emergency calls for help during the first six months of this year.  The human skulls put up on wooden poles back in the stone ages - Was it done out of love?  Music: Säkert! "Dancing, though"  Presenter: Ulla Engberg</description>

                    <description>Today you will have another chance to listen to our programme about the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe and its impact here in Sweden.  You`ll hear from the Swede who`s been called "the engineer who alerted the world" about the disaster.   A former schoolboy who was in Kiev, not far from the disaster when it happened, tells his story.  What do Swedes find appealing about visiting the melted down reactor now? And find out how much radiation is still here in Sweden.</description>

                    <description>Crown Princess Victoria is pregnant, that`s good news for some of this country`s newspapers and magazines.  There`s controversy over a deal to buy helicopters for the army.  There will be no wolf hunts this year, but that doesn`t mean the wolf population in Sweden is safe.  And could a drug based on marijuana be about to get approved for use here in Sweden?</description>

                    <description>Analysis of the government`s decision to scrap promised tax breaks in light of a weakened economy. After yesterday`s explosion at a construction site in Gothenburg, we ask why more people are getting hurt on the job. The contest for the Left party`s next leader heats up as one more candidate joins the race. A Swedish woman abroad leaves her baby outside for just a moment while she runs an errand – with unexpected consequences. And, Sif Ruud, a beloved and unique Swedish actress passes away.

Authorities say that improved technology still allows quality of the service to be maintained, while the fire-fighters warn that lives are at stake.

A year since the first Swedish pig was discovered to carry multi-resistant bacteria, hear about a new investigation aiming to find out how widespread the problem is. Committing the perfect crime gets even harder as the Swedish Social Insurance Agency cracks down on criminals with benefits.

                    <description>The crisis in the Horn of Africa is getting increasingly worse but the political climate makes it difficult for aid organisations to help.   Stockholm stock market dropped more than 3 percent Wednesday, down nearly 18 percent for the year. But considering Sweden’s strong economy what is the reason for this rollercoaster ride? When a priest in southern Sweden came to work one morning part of the church was filled with water, why? Well, someone had stolen parts of the copper roof, and copper theft has become an increasing worry for many of the country’s churches.  At the end of today’s programme Dave Russell will be along to present our review of the week gone by.</description>

                    <description>Online crime is on the rise but police lack the resources needed to patrol online.   Those who live in Stockhom might have noticed that even the inner-city busses are decorated with the rainbow flag as Stockholm Pride kicked off on Monday. We take a look at some of the main issues for this year`s festival.    Yet another study says there is no link between mobile phones and cancer, this time among children.  And, 66 years has passed since Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg was arrested by Soviet troops at the end of World War II but his story continues to fascinate people, and now a new book provides new details about his life and the mystery surrounding his death.</description>

                    <description>Today`s programme is again dominated by the terrorist attacks a short way over the border in Norway. Some Swedish politicians are reacting by calling for tighter laws on gun ownership.  Most of the victims of the attacks were young members of the Norwegian Labour Party. The Swedish young Social Democrats are very close to their Norwegian comrades, and we talked to the Swedish youth leader. Plus we look at the quality of the reporting of this terrorist attack - did Swedish journalists do a good enough job? And we hear about a protest camp that`s currently taking action against a Swedish military test zone in the far north. Music: Til Ungdommen, Helge Engelbrecht/Nordahl Grieg.

Today we’ll be reporting on the speech by Left Party leader Lars Ohly, and a seminar on the law that regulates hiring and firing.  Persecuted authors from abroad are being given a special opportunity for temporary asylum.  There’s a controversial proposal to limit Sweden’s unique right of public access to nature, even when it’s on someone’s property.  Peru’s president says he plans to sue Gothenburg for the return of two thousand year old textiles. But the city’s director of culture tells us they are already in the middle of negotiations.</description>

                    <description>Swedish EU commissioner Cecilia Malmström has suggested withdrawing the right of some EU citizens to travel freely within the union.   A new report that female genital mutilation is still being practiced in Sweden, nearly 30 years after it was outlawed here.  And yet another football match ended in chaos after supporters attacked the goalkeeper.   Looking to get wrinkle free or fill in your lips with silicone? Just remember that those who administer the fillers might not have any medical training.  </description>

We take a look at the transition the party has made over the past 8 years and where it is headed now.

Did friends of the King contact gangsters to try to discredit an unfavourable book?   Online therapy for depression and other disorders is increasingly popular.  But accessing those sites may get harder, because of new legislation it seems like nobody likes.

How is Sweden going to get the extra 4000 doctors and 5000 nurses it needs over the next 10-15 years? The OECD is criticising Sweden for taking money from its aid budget to fund its diplomatic activities in Europe and the western world. We go to the Royal Academy of Sciences for a mock trial between Humanity and planet earth. And it is 80 years since Ådalen riots, which changed the path of Swedish politics.

It was an extremely low turnout from this weekend`s re-vote in Örebro and Västra Götaland. The Queen of Sweden says she`s now ready to look into questions that have long been hanging around about her father`s alleged Nazi past. We remember Birgitta Trotzig, one of Sweden`s great writers, who passed away over the weekend. And the Eurovision song contest concludes. We`ll take a look at how Sweden did.</description>

A new report says children place in care are being mistreated.   The world’s biggest cross country ski race, the Vasa Race, is this weekend, and it’s big business for the province of Dalarna.  Then we`ll be taking a look back at some of the top news stories in Sweden this week, from the 25th anniversary of the death of Prime Minister Olof Palme to a Soviet-style submarine found on the Baltic bottom.   </itunes:summary>

                    <description>The discovery of a Soviet submarine on the sea bottom off the Swedish coast is raising new questions about the Cold War cat and mouse game in the Baltic.  The government strikes a deal with an opposition party on immigration policies, including the right to healthcare for undocumented migrants..   New figures reveal problems in the system that took people off sickness benefits and sent them looking for jobs.  Our reporter takes to the roofs of Stockholm to find out how this cold and snowy winter has meant a lot of extra work to keep people on the sidewalks from getting clobbered by snow and ice. </description>

It’s time for the annual book sales around Sweden, but have e-books and online ordering hurt the brick and mortar bookstores?

                    <description>The bombs made by the Stockholm suicide bomber were much less dangerous than those used in other terrorist attacks, in London and Madrid. An activist says that UN troops in Somalia are causing harm. Travellers are trying to get home for the holiday: we talk to people waiting at the stations and also to an expert at the radio`s traffic bureau. And there`s a debate in Sweden about whether to ban studded tires, although some say that during winter they`re essential. Presenter: Loukas Christodoulou.</description>

                    <description>Amid a slew of criticism from international organisations like the UN, Sweden considers changing asylum rules for christian Iraqis. Sweden has a reputation for equality, but today there`s a report on men`s violence against women. One of our reporters is among the thousands of people stranded in a foreign country by the snowy weather. And we look at some rather far-out versions of the traditional gingerbread house.

                    <description>Swedish carmaker Saab will sell only half of what they predicted this year, now 200 staff won`t have their contracts renewed. But the company is still talking of a bright future.    Newspaper claims the Foreign Office knew about the surveillance at the American Embassy.    There`s a chill in the air now in most of the country. Will this winter be as cold as the last? We talk to the met office, to find out.    Forty young people put together an exhibition about the pressure they face to look nice and fit in.    Music: Joakim Thåström "Karenina"    Presenter: Ulla Engberg</description>

                    <description>Unqualified teachers may soon be a thing of the past as the government launches new certification plans.  It`s Organ Donor week here, 8 out of 10 Swedes say they want to donate their organs after they die, but less than half are actually signed up. Why?  We ask if Sweden really does have a problem with integrating immigrants into Swedish society?  And even toddlers are now surfing the World Wide Web.</description>

But it’s been ten years since the United Nations called for the inclusion of women in peace negotiations.  A prominent Swedish politician has chosen to stay with his family in the US rather than take his seat in parliament.   We talk to Roma broadcasters here about the situation for Europe’s most discriminated minority. </description>

Not everyone is, and the government is now promising people the right to work until they are 69, if they want to.</description>

                    <description>Summertime - when it`s finally here Sweden sometimes seems like a different place. Light fills the Scandinavian world - in the north, it`s daylight 24 hours a day, and even here in Stockholm there`s only about six hours of darkness during the height of summer. So today we`re looking at Midsummer, the Swedish celebration always held on a Friday, between the 20th and the 26th of every June. It`s the very highest height of summer; the days are at their longest. It`s the epitome of this short and hastily enjoyed time of year.</description>

                    <description>Have you ever felt like somebody is watching you? Had a strange name pop up on Facebook wanting to be your friend? Had someone pay special interest in what you are up to and who you are talking to? Many of us wouldn`t pay that a second thought. But for some refugees and immigrants it could be something much more sinister. It could be the government of their former home country keeping track of what they are up to. In this edition of Konflikt in English we look at espionage in refugee communities here, and its effects for those living with the consequences.</description>

                    <description>Maars, Reaper, Swords, and Predator... The face of war is changing as robots and remote-controlled drones hit the battlefields... and in the future the drones may not be remotely controlled by humans at all. They could soon be making life and death decisions all by themselves. In this week`s Konflikt in English on Radio Sweden, we look at robots and what they will mean for warfare in the future. We speak to one of the world`s leading experts on robot warfare; one of the pioneers in the US robot industry; two witnesses that have gotten used to the sound of drones hovering in the sky; and we`ll pay a visit to Linköping, Sweden`s robot capital.</description>

                    <description>Iraq goes to the polls next week, in what has been called by some observers as a crossroads for the nation.  But for whom is it most important? And why?  In this week`s Konflikt in English hear about the election through the eyes and fates of four people who have lived through the occupation in the country. Will we see a repeat of the 2005 election, after which the country fell into sectarian conflict? Or will things carry on as usual, or even normalise? We`ll also hear from two potential voters living here in Sweden. Presenter: Kris Boswell</description>

                    <description>Today`s program from Radio Sweden once again comes from the Royal Dramatic Theater here in Stockholm --  celebrating the 100 year birthday of the imposing marble building and the 220th anniversary of the creation of the theater itself by command of the king. We meet some of those working at the theater at it`s Stockholm waterfront home -- and at the newer site  of the theater`s modern, experimental  stage -- a converted electricity plant just down the road.</description>

                    <description>Easter is a very special holiday season in Sweden, with many customs going back to the Middle Ages. Today with our host George Wood we`ll be exploring those traditions as well as some modern changes. We`ll learn about the Easter witches who go trick or treating on Holy Thursday and travel -- at least in myth -- to the spooky Blue Mountain, and we`ll visit the open air cultural museum Skansen to find out about Easter food. We also take you to Stockholm`s Sofia Church where there are many celebrations of this very religious festival, including a Rainbow Mass, and on the line to the headquarters of the Swedish weather service, we`ll find out about the arrival of Spring. </description>

The continuing debate here on the coming Olympic games in Beijing -- some against and some strongly in favor of a boycott because of arrests and violence in Tibet and Chinese support to the military regime in Burma and other scenes of human rights violations at home and abroad, and some new Swedish jazz from a quartet making noble music "As knights concur." </description>

                    <description>Radio Sweden Tuesday  Football star Zlatan Ibrahimovic and first-class skier Anja Pärson were the big winners at Sweden’s annual sports gala. International children’s books writers gathered in Stockholm to discuss how to broaden an interest for reading among children who don’t have Swedish as their mother tongue. With more and more headlines about juvenile criminals, we ask what Swedish society does in order to keep youngsters from becoming criminals.</description>

                    <description>Radio Sweden Wednesday  Hoping to increase competition among pharmacies, Sweden’s government plans to abolish the state’s exclusive right to sell pharmaceuticals.  The proportion of daily smokers in Sweden decreases – a trend likely to continue after another tax raise on tobacco products. When violence in Kenya started, 2,500 Swedes were in the country. Many of them have left by now. But what can Sweden do to stabilize the situation there?</description>

                    <description>Radio Sweden Monday  With the verdict in one of Sweden`s most discussed cases of teenage violence being pronounced today, we ask how efficient juvenile prisons actually are.  Air travel may mean the beginning of a holiday. But some Swedish teenagers are trying to convince the public that a flight somewhere may be the beginning of a nightmare - when you are sitting in a CIA-plane heading for Guantanamo, for example.  Should asylum seekers from conflict zones be allowed to cite risks created by the general situation in a country, rather than demonstrating they are personally threatened by violence? We hear some experts.</description>

                    <title>Radio Sweden Christmas Special</title>
                    <description>In this festive frenzy of a programme, we`ve got the build-up to the big day, excited Christmas kids, disgruntled goats and a bevy of Christmassy Swedes. We talk to a folk law specialist to uncover the origins of Swedish Christmas food or "julbord", and find out why Santa comes to Swedish children in person. Join us as we stroll through the Christmas market in the ancient heart of the Swedish capital. We hear from Stockholm`s mission to the homeless to hear how Swedes are being urged to make some worthwhile Christmas gifts. We also have a special Christmas message from the English group here at Radio Sweden International. </description>

                    <description>Radio Sweden Thursday  Despite the ongoing debate over climate change, Swedes do not seem to bother about polluting the air. The number of Swedes flying abroad increases significantly.   Swedish police register up to 60 cases of rape every day. With the majority of the perpetrators aged younger than 30, Swedes have begun to wonder whether the younger generation actually knows how to deal with sexuality.  A Swedish businessman has launched an unusual school project in South Africa to combat poverty, unwanted pregnancies and AIDS with education, safe sex and self determination.</description>
