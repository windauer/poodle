                    <itunes:summary>Gordon takes a look a very important 9 month period from September 1948 to May 1949 in the life of Miles Davis. In 1948, Davis was just finishing his tenure with the Charlie Parker band and set out to form his own group. His Royal Roost band, also called the Miles Davis Nonet, was breaking new ground by blurring the lines between big bands and bebop combos. This daring approach to jazz laid the groundwork for his landmark album Birth of the Cool recorded later in 1950.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>The subject of this Jazz Insights is Jack Purvis, a somewhat obscure yet incredibly gifted trumpet player, composer, and arranger. As a trumpet player, Purvis was perhaps the first white trumpet player in the late 1920s to capture the spirit and style of African-American players like Louis Armstrong and Jabo Smith. However, it was perhaps his life outside of music that makes him so memorable. When not on the stage, he spent his time running guns in South America, traveling the world as a con-man with multiple identities, and eventually as a convicted bank robber.</itunes:summary>

While his recording career only lasted around 10 years, Ervin appeared on some of the best recordings from bassist Charles Mingus including Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and Better Git It In Your Soul. During the 1960s, Booker recorded with his own quartet and showed signs of brilliance influenced by jazz giants like John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, and Sonny Stitt.</itunes:summary>

Born in Belgium more by coincidence than residence, Reinhardt was born to gypsy parents and spent most of his formative years traveling from country to country. Originally a banjo player, Reinhardt made the switch to guitar in his early teens and soon after began playing professionally with musicians much older than him. After a fire in his traveling caravan left him with the use of only two fingers on his left hand, Reinhardt spent years recovering and relearning guitar before making his mark as a member of the Hot Club of France. On this final segment, Gordon is joined by author Michael Dregni. Dregni is the foremost expert on Django Reinhardt and has spent perhaps more time than anyone researching Django.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>Gordon continues his series on the influence of jazz structures on rock music in the 1960s. By the late 1950s, the emergence of free jazz isolated much of the public and began to fall out of favor as rock music began winning the hearts of listeners worldwide. During that time, musicians in England began experimenting not only with the blues, but also with elements of jazz. Musicians like Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce, who later went on to form Cream, melded their love of blues, rock and jazz into what is today known as jazz rock fusion. This practice continued throughout the 1960s to include progressive-rock bands like King Crimson and Jethro Tull. In the late 1960s, modal jazz became a big part in blues-rock bands and artists like Jimi Hendrix and the Blues Project.</itunes:summary>

Born near Kansas City in the late 19th century, Sweatman quickly became a virtuosic clarinetist capable of playing in a variety of styles including ragtime and classical among others.  In the early 20th Century, Sweatman started his career as a Vaudeville performer, a move which would help him gain notariaty but also cause him to be panned by most jazz historians.  By the early 1920s, Sweatman escaped the Vaudeville life that had held him back from being a serious musician and began making a string of legendary recordings with the Columbia label with his Original Jazz Band.  However, these recordings would be the last important recordings Sweatman would make as popular music made the switch from Dixieland to Big Band Jazz.</itunes:summary>

The composition in question is Lover Man, a song most famously done by Billie Holiday. Since her version in 1944, this song has been reimagined and re-interpreted hundreds of times and in hundreds of ways.  The second segment of the show examines versions played on the alto saxophone.  Aside from playing examples from the likes of Charlie Parker, Jackie McLean and others, Gordon takes a look at how well the alto saxophone mimics the female voice.  Also, unlike the vocal versions of this song, the alto interpretations leave more room for improvisation and experimentation with the melody of the song.</itunes:summary>

McLean grew up in an area of New York surrounded by legendary figures like Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and soon to be legends like Sonny Rollins and Kenny Drew.  By the third segment set in the mid-1960s, after returning from an extended trip to Paris, Jackie was fully engulfed in free and modal jazz.  In order to help him pull of this emerging style of jazz, Jackie enlisted the help of some younger players like Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams and Jack Dejohnette. </itunes:summary>

In the mid-1960s, after many years of service with the Count Basie Orchestra, Count Basie let Thad know very plainly that his arrangements were far too complex and experimental for the Basie band.  After the Count made the suggestion that he go off on his own, Thad joined forces with drummer Mel Lewis to form the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra.  While performing, arranging and composing for this band, Thad left his mark as a truly great composer and arranger that would challenge and push his arrangements to the point that only the finest jazz musicians would be able to play with him.</itunes:summary>

Each of the players have an evident influence from Lester Young's playing but Getzs horn stands out from them all for the ease in which he plays and his clever choice of notes.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>This segment of Jazz Insights takes a look at the brief career of trumpet player Booker Little.  Little showed great promise from an early age and had been hailed as the predecessor to Clifford Browns bebop legacy.  His mature approach to the instrument and jazz composition received attention from Max Roach who hired him to play as part of his band as well as Eric Dolphy who had him as part of his legendary residency at the Five Spot club in New York City which resulted in three releases from Dolphy.  The virtuosity and versatility of his playing up to his untimely demise at age 23 from complications of uremia put his story up there with the biggest what could have beens in jazz history.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>This segment focuses not on the entire breadth of John Coltrane's work, but instead a period in Coltrane's career from around 1957-1961.  This was a very important transitional period in his life and his music.  In 1957, he recorded a record called Blue Train, which was not his first record as a leader, but perhaps his first important album as a leader.  This segment traces his life from this point in his career and into his work with the famous quarter with McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>This segment of Jazz Insights explores the music of Max Roach and marks the first time that Dr. Gordon Vernick has focused his program on a jazz drummer.  Playing with some of the most important jazz musicians of the twentieth century, Roach ushered in a new approach to drumming, as swing developed into bebop, that focused less on a standard 4/4 backdrop to the music and became more interactive with each soloist.  For this, the fourth and final segment of Max Roach on Jazz Insights on AM 1690, we focus on Max Roachs solo drum work. While the three previous shows focused on his dynamics and drum solos within songs, these are melodic works written specifically for solo drums. This was a first for Roach's time period and would become the bar to which other solo kit work would be measured.</itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>This Jazz Insights is devoted to the first fully-integrated all-female jazz band, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.  They performed in the 1930s and 40s alongside acts such as Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Benny Goodman, and their prowess on their instruments and stage show was just as good.  Gordon discusses the role that women have played in jazz and perhaps why there has not been much attention given to their numerous and notable contributions.</itunes:summary>
