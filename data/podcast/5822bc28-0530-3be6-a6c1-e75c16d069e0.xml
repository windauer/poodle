Today David is inspiring and demanding, he wants us to think of a relationship that we want to have with someone, because that relationship can change something in our lives, or for any other reason ... and then look at the actions we have to take to make that happen.

                    <itunes:summary>You don’t want to miss this show! Today, David talks, tenderly, about a great man who has been an inspiration in his life. A man who wants for nothing, and can chose anywhere in the whole world to live, but has chosen a remote island that can house only 40 people, to call home. A man who brings out a sense of honor and beauty in everything he touches. The man is Sir Richard Branson and the story is about his home, his private island, Necker.
Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson&#160;(born 18 July 1950) is an English&#160;business magnate&#160;and investor. He is best known as the founder of&#160;Virgin Group, which comprises more than 400 companies. At the age of sixteen his first business venture was a magazine called&#160;Student.&#160;In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. In 1972, he opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records, later known as&#160;Virgin Megastores. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up&#160;Virgin Atlantic&#160;and expanded the&#160;Virgin Records&#160;music label. According to the&#160;Forbes&#160;2012&#160;list of billionaires, Branson is the&#160;sixth richest citizen of the United Kingdom, with an estimated net worth of US$4.6 billion.
David reminds you again to crank up the dial on your life and squeeze the juice out of every second.

                    <itunes:summary>In today's show David will discuss &#160;Thandie Newton's TED Talk and how our beliefs that are formed and how we can embrace 'otherness' &#160;and 'oneness' to explore, grow and change and to be our best and live life to its fullest.

Thandie and David will discuss:

	Our 'oneness' vs. 'separateness'
	How the 'self' that we design, becomes the vehicle through which we experience the world
	How the 'self' and our belief that is designed by others is not our vehicle and not our truth, but is something that we can and should change in order to find a 'self' that fits
	How the 'otherness' and the desire to be a part of something affects our mind as we want to fit in
	How dance and acting gave Thandie insight and the deep insight into other lives and emotions
	How we never enter into our authentic self when we act out to win the approval of others
	How 'race' simply comes from our desire to create difference
	How 'oneness' becomes possible through awareness and how critical that is to find our purpose and live life at it's fullest
	How the lack of 'self' is how we find our truest self, authenticity, and purpose

Today Kane will talk about;&#160;


	His life before he started his own business as a Personal Trainer and how much he was making.
	How he was introduced to Network Marketing and his income today.
	His ambition to help others to be fit, healthy and live well financially.
	Watching his father suffer from depression, losing everything and eventually committing suicide.
	Contemplating suicide himself, surviving this, and what led to this.

His great advice to everyone who suffers from depression and thoughts of suicide. “Suicide doesn’t end the chances of life getting worse, suicide eliminates the chances of it ever getting better.”
Kane’s story is beautiful, he has grown so much and gone through so much in his past.&#160; Since joining Network Marketing, he is so excited and you can hear this in his voice as he shares his story and how he wants to help others do the same.&#160;

Todays Quotes
If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts,
Liberates your energy and inspires your hopes
If you are bored with life, if you don’t get up every morning with a
Burning desire to do things, you don’t have enough goals
You want to set a goal that is big enough that is the process
Of achieving it you become someone worth becoming</itunes:summary>

	How she built her business using Facebook.
	Great advice to people growing their business, building their team, building relationships and why some MAY quit.

Barb’s journey is beautiful! Her passion for this industry shows by what she wants for herself, her family and others.&#160; Barb has won awards, trips and is recognized as a 7-figure income earner in the business she is with!

Favorite Quotes:&#160;

“Your Life is your message to the world. Make sure it’s inspiring.”

The Man In The Arena – by Theodore Roosevelt. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer or deeds could have done them better The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

                    <itunes:summary>We’re NOT experts, we’re just LIVING Proof that this does work and you can do it too.&#160; Today David is interviewing to beautiful woman Janine Finney &amp; Lory Muirhead, Mother and Daughter.&#160; Janine has always had a passion for helping others, especially when it comes to achieving financial independence and knows what it is like to be over whelmed, overworked, underpaid and losing hope. &#160; Lory, Janine’s daughter had so many questions about life and what she should be doing, why it had to look a certain way, just because everyone else seems to be okay waking up to an alarm clock, driving through an insane amount of traffic just to sit in a ridiculously small space called an office, and look busy all day while wishing they were somewhere else with different people. And, she decided she wanted NOTHING to do with it.

Janine and Lory knew they wanted freedom and found something they were both passionate about to live their best life.

&#160;

Today Janine &amp; Lory will share:&#160;

	Janine’s introduction to Network Marketing 30 years ago and how she felt about this industry at this time.
	Lory’s life before Network Marketing and how she discovered it.
	How one of them was a BELIEVER and one was a SKEPTIC.
	Know you can have it all, Freedom, Money &amp; Health.
	The feeling of truly helping those you care about most, and how some of those people may steal your DREAMS.
	Life does not have to be hard
	Some advice on what to do if YOU are just starting out in this Industry.
	The Importance of NOT COMPARING companies or yourselves let it go.

They will share a bit of what their book is about The Flip Flop CEO and why we should all read it.

Janine and Lory are beautiful, you will feel how close they are and how extremely passionate they are about this industry and truly living their lives.

                    <itunes:summary>Joining David today is Lisa DeMayo, one of the Top Income Earners at two global network marketing companies.&#160; She has trained thousands of people worldwide for both companies and has been featured as a keynote speaker in the US and abroad.&#160; She was featured on the cover of Empowering Women magazine and was featured in Prosper magazine, too.

She is a member of the National Speakers Association and a self-made multi millionaire. Lisa is a Master of CONVERSATION; today she talks about how she uses this to build her business and the importance of LISTENING GENEROUSLY.

A few points she will talk about today:

	Are you interrupting? Or, Are you truly LISTENING?
	Listening Generously and ASKING the right questions.
	With Social Media, we do more every day, we are to busy and don’t make time to communicate.&#160; Communication is so IMPORTANT and we need it!
	How Network Marketing GROWS so many people.&#160; Building relations and having CONFIDENCE!
	Network Marketing is a Relationship Business.

Lisa’s language is beautiful, and here are amazing works we can all learn from “What May be true for me today may not be my truth tomorrow. Don’t hold anyone accountable.
