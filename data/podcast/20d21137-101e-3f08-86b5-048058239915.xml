                    <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 17:41:37 +0000</pubDate>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan are picky devils when it comes to guests on the show, even more so when Mike is out of the country and they're missing the big man. Anyone joining them has to be drenched in sports, a rare combination of insightful, funny and self-aware and ideally an old mate to boot. This week they've got Erik' the producer' Janssen so it's up to you how many of those boxes have been ticked... *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: the guys unavoidably talk about the sad death of the great Robin Williams; the show continues to get marketing emails from random companies which cause Nat to very nearly piss himself with laughter; big shout out to listener Chris Young who's busy kicking chemo's arse right now. All power and respect to you Chris from all of Americarnage; the guys talk best broadcasting experiences and needlessly emphasize what O.B means about a hundred times; the first week of the pre-season is in the books and if the season ended today the new York Jets would win the Super Bowl; in Cleveland Johnny Football looks set to start their second game against the Pats. Against Detroit he went 7 of 11 for 63 yards and rushed for 27. The NFL Network also broke pre-season TV rating; Kevin Love officially plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves - Cleveland is making the deal with Minnesota with a firm agreement Love will opt out of his contract in 2015 and re-sign with the Cavaliers; loads of baseball goodness; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness; a great 80's sitcom music game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*HdP has his strange 'other producer' rage going on again it seems. He needs to get over this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Dan rock up in Camden with a swing in their step and joy in their heart for a couple of reasons - the big man is BACK after far too long away for one and for the other, incontravertable proof that HdP is &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;a gullable twat&lt;/span&gt; always right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The guys are joined by &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;the busiest and most attractive man in sports production&lt;/span&gt;, Big Phil da Producer who tells us all about Brazil; Dan talks books; Mike talks boxed sets vs old-school film production; &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;HdP's arrogance is shown to all; &lt;/span&gt;the baseball hall of fame get a proper discussion; the NFL's approach to suspensions gets covered, so does domestic violence but in a surprisingly delicate way; loads of great Bodeans Mailbag goodness; a spelling game from Dan which causes deep hilarity and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and no editing happened, it was just like this first time round. Honest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer is a strange time, a time when three of the four big sports are taking a break and so do the 'Carnage crew, hence a bit of a gap since the last show. Mike's still taking that break so Nat and Dan shine the Americarnage symbol in the sky over north London and, like a caped crusader who has no cape and doesn't believe in invading the Holy Land, Marek Larwood answers the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan saw Monty Python and was moderately impressed; Tim Westwood makes his first reference-appearance on the show and does not fare well; Marek went to see the London Blitz humiliate their opponents the other day; Nat talks books; it happened a while ago but LeBron really is going back to Cleveland; Donald Sterling has filed a second lawsuit against the NBA &amp;ndash; this one for corporate fraud but this just makes it better that his shares might get sold to ex-Microsoft man Steve Ballmer; in the NHL the Toronto Maple Leafs have hired a 28 year old AGM; in the MLB the American League won the All-Star game and it was basically all about Jeater; the trade window closes in a week or so and all eyes are on our new favourite name: Philles Bastardo; NFL-wise Tony Dungy is in hot water because he says he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have drafted Michael Sam, because of all that goes &amp;ldquo;with it&amp;rdquo;; Michael Sam no longer has the best selling jersey &amp;ndash; turns out its Biber loving money worshipping Johnny Manziel; the Madden 15 QB ratings are out. Peyton is 98 overall, so is Rodgers, but now Brady is behind Russell Wilson. What? Loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness, Dan comes up with a classicly lacist game (just listen to it, alright?) and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan drag their sorry arses into the studio to try to fill the void left by the Big Man who's AWOL this week because of reasons, they're good ones but they're not good enough to excuse the fact that HdP finds more gaps in the flow to pipe up with his own ill-informed opinions. Serious big man, we need you back. It does however mean, this is an Americarnage After Dark...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: the sales folks who seem to have got hold the 'Carnage email address bring more genius correspondence; The World Soccer Cup gets mentioned but only very briefly and Nat's show is a part of it; Dan rags on the Taiwanese for the first time - pretty random but every nation gets its turn; he then explains phone hacking; the NBA season is over the so is the draft and for the second year running the Cleveland Cavs had the furst overall pick; after wasting last year&amp;rsquo;s selection on the underwhelming Anthony Bennett, they went for Kansas&amp;rsquo; Canadian wunderkind Andrew Wiggins;the NHL draft has happened too and Gary Bettman got booed every time him stepped forward - &amp;ldquo;I love your passion&amp;rdquo; he told the crowd and the Flyers fans shouted &amp;ldquo;sucks&amp;rdquo; after every team name that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Flyers; NFL-wise, Aldon Smith is not going to jail for the bomb threats he allegedly made at LAX in April; charges have been dropped and he now has gun and drink dirivng charges to be heard on 25th July, the day after 49ers camp begins; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness; a game relating to the Driving Theory test gets played, it may or may not be a high point, and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan find themselves in unfamilar surroundings - someone has positioned microphones in front of them and, from through a small double-glased window, some sort of tramp appears to be pressing buttons and adjusting faders. Suddenly it all snaps back! They're in Camden and it's time to dothe first 'Carnage in rather too long! Thankfully, help them through what could otherwise be a shakey evening, it's friend of the show and master of cocktails Mr Paul McFadyen. Then Dan leaves half way through. What the f$%*?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan goes to a documentary festival and becomes more of a wanker apparently; Paul mentions the world cup a little before 7 minutes in but luckily they keep it to a minimum; Mike reccomends telly things; Nat plugs his really rather good footy show for the Guardian (watch it watch it watch it); then there's loads of good NBA, NHL and NFL action as the guys look towards a time very soon where there will be only baseball and the Bodeans Mailbag, plus much, much more of course...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are overjoyed to be back together for the first time in what seems like an age (or precisely 'one restraining order' according to our lawyers) but immediately get back into the swing of things, crashing each other's intro's, Mike using the laugh-box, Nat presenting things which went out with the Ark and all that good stuff. As if that's not enough, we've only got the First Lady of Americarnage too, Ms Kelly-Anne Lyons - hell of a fine week folks, hell of a fine week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan warns everyone he's going to be late, this does not save him from retribution; Kelly gets a new name, some mild misogyny which she shrugs off pretty well and then reveals her stance on other women coming on the show; they all work out that the show could help rescue the careers of recently disgraced celebs; loads of sports stuff has happened since last week, we talk about that; you guys sent in loads of great questions, we talk about those too. Plus of course much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The big man is back! Mike's trip to &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt; R'lyeh&lt;/span&gt; America is done and dusted and he can't wait to get into some draft goodness and/or destroying the human race, whichever is easier. This fills Nat with such dread that he completely fails to make it to the studio mucttering something about filming somewhere called Innsmouth, sure that'll work out well. Sliding into the seat between Irony Carlson and the man who is Dan is all-pro 'Carnage guest, luckiest man in journalism and attendee at this year's draft, Mr Ben Isaacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike's intro leaves Dan a little flummoxed; expenses get discussed - turns out Mike was great at them back in the day but Ben is getting pretty close; Dan read a book about the world of London homelessness in the 70's. It's mental, you should read it too; Ben read a book which is the sort of makey-learny True Detective but still awesome for all that; loads of draft stuff gets discussed; these NBA playoffs keep on getting better, if you haven't been following up until now FOR THE LOVE OF GOD START NOW; the NHL playoffs are pretty damn cool too and, for one, more about skill than escalating violence - amazing; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the Big Man still Stateside Nat and Dan arrive at the studio to find that neither they nor HdP have sorted a guest this week, someone to help fill the aching void that Irony Mike Carlson leaves in their lives. Then they realise that they've never done a show, y'know, just the two of them, so maybe this could be the start of something beautiful...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: it's not;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more other news: The Breakfast Club in Islington can forget that sponsorship deal; Nat tells a story about a beverage he bought; Dan talks about GTA and Senna; there's just a little Iron goodness as Mike sends a three point AND and NFL round-up; all Dan's predictions about the NBA playoffs were wrong, hear how wrong; the draft gets taken very very seriously; HdP isn't listening to a thing Dan says during the NHL round-up... or is he? No; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness; loads of back-referenced goodness and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;After a bit of a break caused by a combination of things (yes, HdP lost the keys to the studio and went on a three-week haribo binge to try to drown his sorrows) Nat and Dan rock up in Camden to find three things have happened: Mike is still away, the fabulous Mr Marek Larwood has turned up and finally that Pappy Dan is real and owns the LA Clippers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan ran a marathon or something; Marek talks films; racism gets discussed a bit, for a change; the 2014 NBA playoffs are go and the Pacers held off the Heat for first spot in the East; the Hawks beat out the resurgent Knicks for the last spot; in the West the Spurs finished first, setting up a match up with Dalla; OKC set up a match up with last year&amp;rsquo;s conference finalists the Grizzlies; in the run-up the NFL draft we know some of these things: Earl Thomas is now the highest paid safety in the NFL; Cj2k is a New York Jet; Aldon smith has been arrested again; Johnn Manziel is going to Bucs; NHL-wise, in the East the Montreal Canadiens swept the Tampa Bay Lightning, who were in the playoffs for the first time since 2011; out West the Ducks went back and forth with the Dallas Stars, but with Ryan Getzlaff looking like a Hart Trophy winner, Anaheim took it in 6; elsewhere, with Malkin and Crosby again leading the line the Penguins beat out the Columbus Blue Jackets in 6; they&amp;rsquo;ll play the winners of New York Philadelphia, which is 3-2 going into tonights game 6; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness; Dan makes up some more characters who may or may not ocme true and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan arrive in Camden a little bit sad as the Iron one is off this week but also really rather glad because the legend of American sports broadcasting that is Simon Crosse has come to play, having recently survived Sotchi and all its brilliance, and immediately plugs the new 'Carnage merchandise. He can stay they reckon, no matter HdP's usual producer-rage...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: it used to be a LOT harder to find out sports results, be thankful future-people; a few more details of the crapness of Russian preparation come via Simon; American sportscasters love to grab each other's bums - FACT; Dan supports UK pro basketball and so should you; Nat talks Mickey Rooney; there's a bit of Iron Goodness as the big man sends in a round-up; lots of NFL chat, lots of MLB chat, even more NBA and NHL chat. Who'd have thought? Loads of great stuff in the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much, more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan&amp;nbsp;are jubilant this week, for two very good reasons: Firstly, there have been not one but THREE opening days for baseball and the season is away and swinging. Secondly, they're joined by a man who not only has an encyclopedic knowledge of them damned (New York) Yankees, but who also played some fine fine football for Hollywood's beloved Premiership team. Ladies and gentlement, put your hands together for mister Chris Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike attempts an April Fool, the guys are sarcastically appreciative of it; Dan is preparing for the marathon by carrying around cake; Dan's Zombie approach to fantasy MLB once again garners comment, but not much at all, promise; Mike talks Belgian detectives; one idea for a segment is floated and should not be done; another idea for a slot is floated and in fact turns up after the credits so of course doesn't count towards out Offensiveness Quotient; Chris brings up a Sith Lord running for president; Nat talks Lee Steinberg but hasn't read the book yet; loads and loads of MLB is talked, tune in to find out how much; we're into the last ten games of the NBA regular season and after a long hard season of chasing the Pacers, the Miami Heat are back on top of the Eastern Conference; in the West the Spurs have all but tied up first seed after 18 straight wins, although OKC and the Clippers are both on tears of their own; the Pacers are in an absolute tailspin; in the hockey, Boston lead the East and are joined in the playoffs by Pittsburgh; in the West St Louis narrowly have the top seed from Anaheim, although San Jose Colorado and last year&amp;rsquo;s champs Chicago are already there; plenty of NFL stuff; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;So it's stickball season once again and if there's one thing the at Nat, Mike and Dan love it's a bit of fantasy MLB. Well, ok, that may be a bit of an exaggeration but boy do they have things to say about it, mainly Mike...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike does a partial strip-tease, Nat and Dan are surprisingly impressed with the results but doubt its punctuation; Mike talks auto-drafts; Dan was in Portugal last week, this gets strangely little comment; the selecting of teams for folks gets serious and we're exporting rather than importing this week; Nat talks Sports Illustrated; but three weeks of the NBA season left and Indiana still lead the East, now up 4 games on the falterming Miami Heat; San Antonio lead the West after an unimpeachable 13 game streak that OKC in their tracks; don&amp;rsquo;t nobody care about winners no mo&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s about the LOSERS - the Philadelhpia 76ers were widely believed to be tanking the season when they signed the injured rookie Nerlens Noel who still hasn&amp;rsquo;t played for them and are now on an amazing 25 game losing streak; in the NHL Boston lead the East, although last night their 12 game winning streak was finally beaten by an Alex Galchenyuk GWG for your Montrea Canadiens; with 10 games to go the Bruins are the only team in the east in the playoffs; in the West the St Louis Blues are there, as are the San Jose Sharks who are on quite the last season run at the moment; massive amounts of free agency goodess in the NFL, Mike talks you through that; bit of baseball (the actual kind) but loads more next week; plenty of fun from the Bodeans Mailbag; a strange bit of filling at the end which didn't need to happen but was fun enough to leave in, and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Don't worry though, Dan takes just 4 minutes to talk about poo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: there's booze and cake in the studio, this always works out well; Dan is a big fan of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial, mainly the vomiting; the Americarnage merchandise store is launching soon, presents for loved ones will never be a problem again; Nat talks Romney documentaries, disturbingly watchable stuff; Mike talks NFL free agency in a frankly bewildering amount of detail; in the NHL&amp;nbsp;it's all&amp;nbsp;change at the top &amp;ndash; Boston leads the East from Pittsburgh and Montreal after pulling back ten games on the Pens since December; St Louis lead the West from Anaheim for the first time all season; NBA-wise, Indiana lead the East from Miami, San Antonio have leapfrogged the OKC Thunder, they&amp;rsquo;re 6 straight in a time when everyone is losing; Lebron hit 6 of 18 from the field and later blamed the special T shirts he had been made to wear as part of the NBA&amp;rsquo;s Noche Latina; laods og Bodeans Mailbag goodness, including the revelation that we're so wrong all the time that Corrections and Clarifications should make a return - we're up for this, send us your C&amp;amp;C's! great (slightly stolen) game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nat and Phil hit a wrap party and Phil tore up the dance floor, capturing all hearts; Phil shows how to style it out if you don't know what's going on; Dan went to see pre-release bits of a film, ate muffins and will never be asked back; Nat and HdP love House of Cards season 2; NFL free agency begins next week so the big work right now is being done by the agents, the rumour mill and the bean-counters looking to free up cap space so they don't turn up to the party unable to buy their round; Golden Tate will be one of those looking to be snapped up for mucho dinero; the new Tampa Bay uniform has been revealed and whatever they were trying to achieve, they haven't done it; in the NHL Pittsburgh lead the East from Boston; Anaheim lead St Louis in the West with around 20 games left; with every team back in action after the Olympics, the talk of the town is of the approaching trade deadline and most of the League have been busy little bastards; ndiana lead the East from Miami, OKC lead the West from San Antonio, but with the Clippers, the Rockets and Trail Blazers all streaking, it&amp;rsquo;s anyone&amp;rsquo;s game with around 25 games left; last week we were taping just as the Heat were beating the Thunder and Serge Ibaka, who you may recall ain&amp;rsquo;t about dis life, breaking Lebron&amp;rsquo;s nose; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodies and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

HdP's best efforts can't cheers them up (honestly, he jingled his keys and everything) but when First Lady of Americarnage Kelly-Anne Lyons turns up they decide that life is worthwhile after all, turn those frowns upside down and get on with the business of recording the best gosh-darn podcast they can, like big boys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike has brought his mini-me, Mr Nate Carlson, who promptly slags off the gang, demands payment and crashes Nat's links so we can assume that the next generation will be business as usual; the Lego movie is surprisingly dark; Amazon is making tv shows, Mike recommends one; Dan watches&amp;nbsp;a film of roughly the vintage that Nat usually does, surprise ensues; Nat's all about House of Cards, a quality second season in the offing; lots of off-season action in the NFL, the guys plough into this with their usual aplomb; in the NBA, Indiana lead the East, OKC lead the West, but the NBA has had a quiet weekend because of the annual clusterfuck of showing off that is the All Star break; on Sunday in New Orleans, the East took on the West and both teams played even less defence than usual, running up a record score of 163-155; NHL-wise, Anaheim lead the West from St Louis, Pittsburgh lead the West from Boston. It&amp;rsquo;s basically the same as when we left you; what is different, is the league hit shutdown as many of the players went to Sochi; The Winter Olympics got underway, Canada&amp;rsquo;s path to the next round was fairly roiutine, putting away Norway, Austria and Finland in overtime thanks to two Drew Doughty goals; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness, a grand old game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Dan have lost Nat to NYC in the build up to some sporting event or other so be prepared for the channel 4 coverage to have plenty of cutaways with Nat singing 'if I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere...' while wearing C4 foam fingers. Aaaanyway, to help fill the gap left by N-Power's absence we've got Shortlist's sports editor, Bears fan and long-time friend of the show Mr Ben Isaacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Ben's off to train with the Welsh rugby team and his recent gym usage has simply broken him rather than started to rebuild him - this could be the last time we see him; Dan met Gavin Henson once then spends time defending Charlotte Church; Mike mentions Nietsche and thing get strangely philosophical (hence the title, geddit?!); lots of pro bowl talk;lots of head coach talk; plenty plenty super bowl talk; baseball talk; NHL and NBA talk; Bodeans Mailbag action and some betting, what more could you want. Possibly much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Mike arrive in the studio this week with a spring in their step and joy in their hearts, all is right with the world. Until HdP tells them that Dan can't make it to the show and the tears start to flow... Luckily writer and broadcaster Stig Abell is about so he chucks them on the chin and tells them to turn their frowns upside down, to get on with talking about sports like big boys. So that, dear listener, is what they did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Stig reads lots of books while commuting and reckons you can too; Mike talks about books too then Nat does as well so the first 18 minutes or so are pretty literary; don't worry, this changes; all agree that the era of men wearing hats was a good thing; the Pro Bowl is coming but amazingly it gets ignored - we may not be the only group of people to do this; for the first time in 4 years or so the top seeds are facing off against each other in the Super Bowl, 'should be pretty epic' appears to be the general consensus; very little time is devoted to Richard Sherman; supposedly elite refereees are anything but; in the NBA, Kobe says the league is more about finesse these days; San Antonio, Portland and OKC lead the West; the Nets beat the Nicks at The Garden; big baseball discussions are had; hockey is talked about; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodies and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan are having to do without the Big Man this week and things were looking pretty grim - it seemed like HdP might even have to talk more and we know for a fact that shouldn't happen. Luckily for all involved the tower of power that is TM Football's Will Gavin stepped into the breach, which means not only that once again Pods Collide, but also a reuniting of the Absolute Radio *coughAbsoluteRadio90'scough* NFL team. Apparently he only came to see Mike which makes for an awkward moment or two...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Once again sports take about 14 minutes to arrive. It would have been longer but for the edit, see if you can spot the joins; stories of working with Dan in other places prove remarkably familiar and he brings a joke which was censored elsewhere; 12 Years a Slave is apparently quite harrowing; Dan talks hip-hop; the niners resort to old-school football while the panthers end up being just a bit little-brother; the seahawks have the best pass-d in the league; loads of other things but you'll hear them when you listen; are nicknames on jerseys the lamest gimmick the NBA have tried? Probably not but boy do they suck; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness; Dan gets close to home with his Hollywood Animals game and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are back from the festive season feeling fired up and ready to dish it out; Dan especially as Mike calls him on the amount he talk about cacapoopoopeepee. Turns out it's quite a lot. Helping them deal with this and making his long-awaited return is the all-pro Qaurterback and man wth one week to live, Marek Larwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The BBC messed up the new year fireworks; Marek will sleep with all three members of Haim but not one at a time; various joke opportunities are missed, other ones which should have been aren't; Dan's getting ready to run the London marathon and has succumbed to the sickness of being unable to stop talking about it; films have been watched and that takes up much of the first 18 minutes so if you just want sports, that's where to skip to; speaking of sports, loads of that has happened since we were last in the studio, so much that I couldn't possibly list it here - listen to find out; great stuff from the Bodeans Mailbag, an epic game to start the year with and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That leaves HdP his yearly joyous task of finding some of the 'best' bits for Lazy-Ass Clip Show 3: Clip This. He's found some rude stuff, some horrendously offensive stuff and a few bits about sports so I guess that's pretty representative if nothing else...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Huge thanks to everone who's joined us this year, 'Carnage friends old and new, you've given of your time to help make this a hell of a year for us. Even huger thanks to everyone who's tweeted us, facebook'd us, trolled us, come to visit us in Camden and listened to us in 2013, you're a mad bunch of bastards and we love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Christmas and a fine-ass new year, we'll be back in January.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan are obviously highly cultured individuals, if usually more of the petri-dish type, so they're taking the chance this week to talk you through some top Christmas films. 'But what about Mike, he's great on films on the side' I hear shouted in the direction of the studios, possibly in a Connecticut accent. Well, Mike's on family duties so helping sort the winter wheat from the Christmas chaff is All-Pro 'Carnage guest and busiest man in media, Phil 'tha producer' Spooner.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: Dan makes various personal suggestions about Mike seeing as he's not here to defend himself; Harry's beard makes him suspected Al Quaeda but his actions make him a confirmed booze-hound; Nat promotes himself to colonel, this doesn't last long; Dan is doing the London Marathon, this is not the last time you'll hear about this fact; Week 15 has been all about enormous field goals which everyone seems strangely excited about; The Super-Chargers do what no-one thought they would; Tony Romo is hated as much as Jamaal Charles is loved; NBA-wise it's Indiana and Portland at the top; Josh Smith is very very good; Kobe wants to win a championship, he's not going to this year; Pittsburgh and Chicago are top of the NHL tree but Vancouver are blasting up the ratings so they're the ones to watch; an especially disturbing but brilliant Bodean's Mailbag this week (cheers Dan, that mic now has to be burnt) the promised film discussion and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Mike are calm, dignified men and so take the news that Hollywood can't make it this week with their usual sombre grace - mourning internally in their own ways while keeping up appearances for the sake of the listeners. Luckily the seat left by Dan doesn't need to be empty and the non-stop 'Carnage party can continue as Mr Stig Abell steps into the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Stig is the recently-appointed managing editor of The Sun so we ask ONE of the phone-hacking questions sent in and it goes really really well; HdP lies all the time apparently but his beard is ok so that's kind of fine, right? Mike's old 'tache gets discussed; the utter madness of last sunday gets discussed in depth; is fantasy football snowball fights a thing? It should be; running in snow is hard, unless your name is Jacoby Jones; Mike sings his round up, you have to hear it to believe it; in the NHL the Canadienes are covered thoroughly, possibly at the expense of every other team; some basketball things happen, some MLB chat is had, loads of good Bodeans Mailbag stuff happens too and Dan's influence manifests with a great game he sent in and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are pure athletes, able to accomplish any feat to which the human body is equal. Thing is, Mike isn't here this week so the conversation OBVIOUSLY turns to what the largest animal he could throw over a building might be. Adding substantially to this earnest debate is the simply brilliant Mr David Whitney, master of stand-up, acting and bagpipes. Mock if you dare, he's better than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Everyone cares about Nat, which is nice; Americarnage is sending a Camden goth to the podcast awards in Vegas to collect our award for us, y'know, 'cos we're bound to win; the city of Atlanta gets a long discussion and even a little love; in the NFL the week started on Thanksgiving &amp;ndash; the Lions destroyed the Packers and took control of the NFC North, more so when the Minnesota Vikings beat the Bears on Sunday despite their attempts to tie for the second time this season; Matt Flynn got sacked 7 times, DeAndre Levy picked him off for his 6th of the season; in the NBA Indiana lead the East, still, and they&amp;rsquo;re now enjoying the best start to the season in franchise history; Miami are 10 straight, but still in second and besides Washington, everyone else in the Eastern Conference has a losing record; in the West the Trailblazers lead from the Spurs. Last night the West met the East in Portland and despite Paul George putting up an insane career high of 43, the Pacers still lost thanks mainly to a Lamarcus Aldridge double double; in the Hockey Boston lead the East from Pittsburgh and Montreal; Chicago lead the West from san Jose and Anaheim; most of the chat is about last week&amp;rsquo;s law suit, with the backlash beginning apace. Don Cherry calls it a money grab, while Jeremy Roenick said of the players : "They can go after the league that they craved to be in since they were little kids and paid their salary,"; Dan says the internet is full of lies big-ticket players get discussed ferociously; loads of Bodeans Mailbag goodness and a gane to boot, what more do you need? Much, much more perhaps...?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <itunes:subtitle>Nat, Mike and Dan are pure athletes, able to accomplish any feat to which the human body is equal.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat is on IR this week so Mike and Dan are wondering who they could get in who would have the sheer depth of knowledge needed for the show this week. Step forward the original stats man and winner of this year's 'Carnage fatasy baseball league, Mr Colin Jarman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike is racist about English teeth, because that's a thing apparently; Dan does cultural things; Mike talks to authors and turns down requests to autograph other people's books; the Cowboys do things surprisingly well; the Bucs do things badly but still win; Tom beats Peyton and the hyperbole goes into the stratosphere; Indy look way too normal; Altanta are the first team to mathmatically out of the playoffs; the AFC really is awful; in the NBA, San Antonio lead the West; Indiana lead the East, both are 13 and 1; Miami are 7 straight and in the West Portland are 11 straight. Pretty much everyone in the East is losing; loads of trades happen in the MLB trade-wise;&amp;nbsp; hockey-wise Boston lead the East despite a late scare last night against the Pens, who equalised in ,3 seconds left before the Bruins won overtime; loads of the usual greatness from the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are about as cultured as they come and are currently challenging Hull for the honour of being the centre of British culture in a few years time. Let you know how it goes but we're optimistic about this one... To aid them the most cultured of all sports producers, Mr Marc Reeks is in the house tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Marc is a Raiders fan and has a name that could mean somthing else - in their infinite cleverness the guys find something amusing in this; he's also a purveyor of incredible sporting coverage, listen to find out more; Dan tries to offend even more people, this time taking aim at the North of England. Sorry; 150th anniversary of the Gettysberg address, Mike waxes lyrical; week 11 showed gave us the battle of the replacement quarterbacks followed by the return of the old dog; Gronk gets slammed; the Broncos prove things, so does Alex Smith; in the NBA Indiana lead the East, San Antonio lead the West, but Miami and Portland started and ended the week unbeaten, so they are both up there; in the Eastern Conference only 4 teams out of 15 currently have winning records - spare a thought for the Atlantic Division, which unfancied Philadelphia top a table; NHL-wise Boston lead the East, Chicago are level with Anaheim in the West although 18 out of 14 teams in the West are a win away from the top and nearly everyone in the new Pacific division has the same number of points REALIGNMENT IS A FAILURE; MLB awards are finally discussed; loads of goodies in the Bodeans Mailbag; robots feature again in a great game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: last day or so of voting for the Podcast awards, get us over the line; ASDA FM gets some love; Dan's 'teche is gone as a protest against Movember; Tony Romo continues to amaze for the wrong reasons; the Bengals miss out in a thriller against the Ravens; concussions continue to rock the NFL; Tampa get off the mark; the Rams beat the Colts down in a surprise outing for Kellen Clemens; we&amp;rsquo;re about a tenth of the way through the NBA regular season and the unbeaten Indiana Pacers lead the East, while San Antonio unsurprisingly lead the West; Miami continue to stutter, adding to their back to back losses last week against the Nets and Sixers with defeat against Boston&amp;rsquo;s threadbare team with a buzzer beater from Jeff Green with less than a second to go. Last night they roared back; Lebron put 33 on the Bucks and sat out the entire 4th quarter; in the NHL Tampa lead the East; Colorado share the west with Chicago; I know, what is going on; loads of great Bodeans Mailbag action; Twit or Twat returns and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are true soldiers, bashment warriors, turntablist... Well not really but for the first couple of minutes of this week's show they had the nation fooled. That's what HdP's changed his name to by the way, 'The Nation'. Probably change it back soon when he realises how silly it is. Aaaaanyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: Podcast Awards voting is still open, vote every day til the 15th of November if you can; Mike's expansion team maths comes up again; Nat has seen several films which were released this decade; Mike talks books and George Pelicanos gets a big-up; Dan's off to see the Arcade Fire and is remarkably smug about it; Tampa Bay do crazy things; Seattle do better crazy things but still looking fallible; Case Keenum has his balls out all game; Gary Kubiak will get better; workplace bullying in the NFL? Really? also, what sort of name is Incognito; the NBA season is off and running, on Tuesday we tipped off with two heavyweight ties that turned out to be mismatches - the Double Champion Heat ran all over the Bulls; Derek Rose played 34 minutes in his big return from a season blighted by injury, but Lebron hit 17 and Shane Battier put down every three he tried. Carlos boozer managed a third of all of the Bulls&amp;rsquo; points as they went down 107-95; The Ducks are taking the NHL by storm they top the West after beating New York on Monday; Pittsburgh top the East; The Duck&amp;rsquo;s Corey Perry was subjected to something incredible on Monday - With fifteen seconds left in the second, Ryan McDonagh of the Rangers shoved the Ducks star into the Rangers bench. He climbed out and ten seconds later MCDONAGH DID IT AGAIN. The crowd went wild, the Rangers still lost. Pointless really. Filthy game from Dan, loads of good stuff from the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;With Mike doing Eurosport this week, Nat and Dan were left having a discussion about how bloody good they both are at everything when who should walk in but a man who's won enough gold medals to look like Mr T if he were of a mind to: Mark Hunter OBE. Luckily he's also a massive 49ers fan so they thought they should have a chat together, get HdP to record it and put it out. Y'know, like a podcast or something. Well dear reader, this is what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The nature of pressure is discused; Captain Phillips gets an Oscar discussion going and it turns out Nat acted with Chiwetel Ojiofor (and has the added bonus of being able to pronounce his name); the second grand sharabang that is the International Series rolled into town and all the hurt in the world poured over the Jags; the Bengals destroyed the Jets with very little input from either Green or Green-Ellis - this team is looking deeper every week; Aaaron Ridgers passed for 284 yards and two touchdowns; while James Starks and Eddie Lacey ran for 180 yards combined, meaning the Packers do at last have a running game; it's the weirdest World Series ever and by the time you read this it'll probably be over; the Sharks and Avs are the talk of the NHL lighting up the West and refusing to lose. Coloardo under new coach Patrick Roy have gone from nothing to something very quickly &amp;ndash; winning 10 of their opening 11 game; on Sunday Paul Stasny netted the winner against the Jets and Semyon Varlamov made 24 saves for a team that are now good good good; NBA season is upon us and Miami tip off against the resurgent Chicago Bulls who have got D Rose back in their rotation for the first time in a yea; this year we have a new team &amp;ndash; the new Orleans Pelicans, formerly the Hornets; whose recent name change clears the way for the Charlotte Bobcats to return as the Hornets next years; loads of brilliant questions in the Bodeasn Mailbag; we've got a new sponsor! Listen for details and head to squarespace.com to help yourself and us out; another great game from Dan and Much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, maybe it's the joy of reunion, maybe it's the can of energy drink that HdP slipped Mike just before the show...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The guys sum up Homeland in a way which means you never need to watch it; Nat's choice of films is influenced by time; injuries galore in week 7; Pat McAfee is the greatest punter in the NFL; the cheifs just hold on to their unbroken streak; RIP Bum Phillips, great coach; hockey things happen but the guys are more interested in the lack of imagination in KHL names; the Playoffs continue and Mike outlines how the World Series needs to go down; loads of fun from the Bodeans Mailbag; Dan tells us about his holiday and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Inie is going to be a lawyer, this could prove useful to the 'Carange crew; James has love for Seattle and plugs an excellent bar which celebrates all its sporting success; Adrian Peterson plays despite his horrendous news, some columnists try to make mileage of this and should have terrible things happen to them; the Pats finish the Saints winning streak despite a Brady pick; the Rams get an impressive road win; Detroit prove the new-look Browns are still the Browns; in the MLB, the play-offs are actually exciting; loads of exciting stuff from the Bodeans Mailbag; the guys discuss times when they've pulled a Romo - been clutch but still publicly ragged, and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan were all over Wembley last weekend and loved every second of it - especially the risk of death from the big flame-y things and a nailbiter of a game. Mike has been busy doing last-minute obituaries for American writers so we're without the Big Man again this week. Stepping in to join the fun though are friend of the show Caimh McDonnell and superstar producer long-time-listener-first-time-caller Marc Reeks. Harry reacts well to another producer in the room again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The guys had great fun at the Regents Street bash and the Wembley game, met a few fine folks; three points gets a little out of hand but it's worth it, promise; Minnesota and Pittsburgh came to town with the worst records in the league and only the Vikings left town with their heads held high; Matt Cassell stood in for Christian Ponder and threw two touchdowns and 248 yards to Greg Jennings, and let AP run into two big ones; Ben threw two interceptions and 83,519 went home happy, expect anyone who saw gene Simmons do the national anthem; in the MLB Russell Martin blasted two home runs and Marlon Byrd smashed another to give the Pittsburgh Pirates a 6-2 Major League Baseball playoff triumph over Cincinnati; the other National League playoff series opening later this week will match the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Atlanta Braves; in the NHL the first season since Gary Bettman&amp;rsquo;s ill advised realignment programme began with the Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks beat the Washington Capitals; loads of good stuff in the Bodeans Mailbag; a warning about side-effects turned into a game by Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan have been busy this week, busy doing things like being on the radio, watching films and talking to the Minnesota Vikings who for some reason are camped out at a hotel in Hertfordshire. Well everyone needs a holiday. With that in mind, Mike has taken this week to go spear-fishing in the canals of Camden so slipping into his seat is friend of the show and bona-fide super-Canuck Erik (the producer) Janssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Rush is a surprisingly good film; Dan talks Tottenham Tramps and fibs about (possibly) illegal activity; Nat talks Americarnage ringtones and the best telly of the last few years; Peyton Manning torched the raiders on Monday night, 37-21 in game that left Terrelle Pryor with a concussion after a double sack; on Thursday the misifiring Eages lost at home to the resurgent Cheifs - several Vick turnovers and two muffed punts brought home the win for Redi&amp;rsquo;s new boys; the gang will be out there on Regent Street on saturday and tailgating on sunday, go and find them and take photos; the NBA has dream up a new scheme to sell jerseys: for a set number of games this season they will be allowing teams to sport their nicknames on their back and not just their surnames. So Dwayne Wade will be D w-ade. Paul Piecrce the Truth and Chris Bosh will be CB4. The move has been condmedn by some journalists, or &amp;lsquo;J-Lists&amp;rsquo;. Loads of action from the Bodeans Mailbag; brilliant game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan like to think they take care of their listeners and in this episode they make sure that anyone new to the show doesn't get themselves into trouble. Because they do such a good job of that with themselves...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nat and Dan confuse Mike over certain English traditions; Nat and Mike filled for a million years on Sunday; Dan ate pizza and bodily functions on Absolute Radio; short films, the Goodie Mob and Calvados get love; the battle for the AFC West was delayed by lighting as the Seahawks prepared to demolish the now rubbish Colin Kaepernick - a leaky 49ers offence buckled under the noise at Century; the NHL preseason got underway on Monday and Alan Vigneault has his first unofficial win as Rangers coach, winning 3-2 against the Flyers; Florida beat Nashvile twice in their split squad series Boston beat Montreal, including two for Jarome Iginla; the NBA is investigating the Brooklyn Nets over their highly suspicious signing of Russian b&amp;rsquo;ball legend Mikhail Kirilenko from the Minnesota Timberwolves; loads and loads of Bodeans Mailbag magic; a tiny bit of Fantasy League; more brilliant game action from Dan and much, much more&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He claims to be &amp;lsquo;hanging out&amp;rsquo; with evil dictator Kim Jong Un and now plans to take a team of NBA legends out there.

So far he has not done so; Miami Heat coach, Erik Spoelstra decided to go and drop some knowledge on the Seattle Seahawks this week.

&lt;p&gt;Aaaanyway, here's a very lightly tweaked recording of the show for you with Nat, Mike, Dan and Marek doing their best to defeat the audience in a series of challenges, along with a bonus track at the end featuring the enormously funny James Loveridge and our very own Dan Louw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the saddle for weekly 'Carnage goodness next week as we roll into preseason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Dan brave the bubbling tarmac of summertime Camden, diving for the airconditioned goodness of the Americarnage studio. Nat has other ideas and has fled the country once more. Making up the triad this week is a man who's soon to do something similar, except instead of a holiday in France it'll be taking Avenue Q to South Korea: brilliant actor and certified Tennessee Galoot, Chris Ragland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other News: Vladimir Putin has been in a submarine lately and Dan would do terrible love-things to his ex-wife apparently; Dan pitched shows to the production company that made Sharknado - blame him; Manning Camp is underway and the biggest casualty so far has been Johnny Manziel&amp;rsquo;s head - the Texas A&amp;amp;M quarterback was sent home suffering from dehydration and exhaustion. Totally not a hangover; the big talk in the league is the ione that got away &amp;ndash; Ilya Kovalchuk of the New Jersey Devils has decided to retire effective immediately -the only problem is that he had 12 years and 77 million left on his contract, which he chose to forgo; Dominic Moore is returning to hockey after spending a year away nursing his wife back from liver cancer - the former member of the Lightning will now grace the third of fourth line of the Rangers; the All-Star will have happened by now and is it still a let-down? Loads of good stuff from the Bodeans Mailbag, a discussion on accents and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and it's the last show before Americarnage Live! A few tickets left but you'd best be quick:&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan went to see Springsteen together at Hard Rock Calling. Mike cou;dn't make it to that or indeed this week's show (although he did send some pre-recorded Iron Goodness so worry not Carlson fans) so into the guest seat slips journalist, Bears fan and Americarnage's College football expert Ben Isaacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The guys talk about thier names when they were younger and for some reason they seem to think this is interesting; the Boss gets discussed of course; there's a tiny bit of mobile phone interferance and it's HdP's fault - he has been disciplined; great sports books get discussed; the Heat are NBA champions, setting Lebron up for all sorts of records; Lebron does not let anyone forget he knows he's the greatest player ever; draft night business was fun as Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce get traded to Boston and all sorts of other chicanery; the Blackhawks have the Stanley Cup amidst ding-dong action; baseball things happen; someone called Aaron Hernandez is in the news for something or other; loads of great questions in the Bodeans Mailbag; dodgy wise-guy acting in Hollywood's new game and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: some of the most exciting action ever in the NBA finals; Jason Kidd is now the coach of the Brooklyn nets. The tiny bald point gaurd replaces PJ Carlessim, who replaced Avery Johnson at Christmas; The Stanley Cup Final goes into Game 4 tonight, with a finely poised series between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Boston Bruins; proper Bodeans Mailbag action; a game we totally liberated from http://brunching.com/, head over there to find more funny stuff; loads of NFL stuff, plenty of hockey stuff, HdP wants to get to the pub and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan finds painkillers on his desk at work and, like any sensible fella, takes them with hilarious consequences; the 2013 NBA Championship will be between the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs; in the NHL the conference Finals are underway - in the East we have the 2009 champion Penguins vs the 2011 champion Bruins; in the West it&amp;rsquo;s last year&amp;rsquo;s winners, the Kings vs the 2010 victors Blackhawks; Penguins beat the Ottawa Senators in their conference semi. Despite most people expecting the sweep, Ottawa nicked an overtime win in game three before getting blown away in the next 2 &amp;ndash; shipping a total of 13 goals and returning to Canada in shame; Major League Baseball will be looking to suspend some of the game&amp;rsquo;s biggest stars including everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite reflection kissing former Short Stop Alex Rodriguez, who is one of 20 or so players connected to Biogensis scandal; great new game from Dan highlighting the joys of Amazon reviews; loads of action from the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Luckily they're going to get another chance at the end of July at the Forge and Fountry in Camden when Americarnage Live 2 (tagline pending) will be all up in your grill. Email Americarnage@memointeractive.com or head to forgevenue.org to pre-book tickets for what will be literally an event in the summer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The gang talk soccer for a little while but don't worry, it doesn't last; Iron Mike is back and straight away starts recommending crime novels; Dan finds a great shop for vintage NFL jerseys; in the NBA we are into the Conference finals, last time out Miami were almost in the Eastern Conference finals, needing just one more win against the Bulls to make the finals for the third straight year; Carlos Boozer threw down 26, and despite the Bulls leading by 11 late in the third, Lebron, D Wade and a couple of missed 3 handed it to Miami; in the West, it&amp;rsquo;s the Spurs vs the Grizzlies - San Antonio took control in game 5 of their series against golden state, cruising past by 18 points and finished them on the road in game 6 as GSW, nursing injuries to Harrison Barnes, Steph Curry and Jarret Jack, finally gave up; in the NHL it's overtime-tastic with the Penguins vs unfashionable Ottawa taking this to the limit; the Pens took game 1 in OT, breaking the Sens incredible record of 7 straight OT wins on the road. Game 2 went to the Pens as well, while game three went to double overtime until Colin Greening smuggled home past Thomas Vokoun; loads of other things have happened, many of them get asked about in the Bodeans Mailbag; por-celebrity Twit of Twat makes a welcome return and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan are musical folks and this week, while Mike's at Eurosport (which they totally remembered and everything) they take the chance to invite not only master of all sports Erik Janssen but also musician, rapper and the man responsible for the quality jingle action on the show, Nicky Spesh, who brings us a big bag of new and cracking stuff. Together they make an ENORMOUS show with one part which will probably never get played again. You've been warned. Dan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nick tells us things we never knew about Dan; Dan tells us things we already knew about himself; Nat reveals his surprising breadth of rap knowledge; NBA-wise, the first playoff round in the East saw the Heat sweep the Bucks, the Knicks end the Celtics in 6, the banged up Bulls beat the Nets in 7 and Indiana beat Atlanta in 6; in the West the Spurs swept the Lakers, the Thunder struggled past Houston in 6; Golden State beat Denver in 6; likewise Memphis against the LA Clippers; NFL silly season is upon us &amp;ndash; when players get arrested in the months before they return to training camp - and Dan has a rather astute take on the Titus Young situation which he lets on about after the gang take the piss mercilessly; the first round of the 2013 NHL playoffs ended last night with Game 7s in Boston and Washington and the biggest surprise of the round at that point had been what a good go of it the New York Islanders had made against the Pittsburgh Penguins; Erik tells us lots of great baseball stuff; the guys provide Nick with a team in each major sport but take ages about it; loads of Bodeans Mailbag action, translated rap game from Dan and Nick sings us out, plus much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Rain Man the Animated Series gets pitched; Mike reccommends good stuff; Oliver Stone gets discussed, later on so to awful awful fims - the two may be related or may not be;&amp;nbsp; The Draft took place on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and boy were there some surprises&amp;hellip; Eric Fisher went first to the Chiefs, leaving Luke Joeckel to the Jaguars; only one quarterback went in the first round &amp;ndash; Ej Manuel going to the Bills despite a series of Mock Drafts linking them with Ryan Nassib; in the NBA we&amp;rsquo;re entering the final games of the first round, but not for San Antonio and Miami, who are both through; Miami swept the Bucks without Dwayne Wade, and even though Lebron put up thirty in game 4 they probably could have done it without him too; the 2012-13 NHL playoffs are under way and last night the Presidents Trophy winning Chicago Blackhawks took on the Minnesota Wild inn the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and the Blackhawks took it in OT with a breakaway goal from Bryan Bickell; in St Louis, the current champion LA Kings went down in overtime thanks to a cheeky short handed goal by Alex Steen, who stole the puck from Jonathan Quick and nicked his second. Would have been fine but Quick&amp;rsquo;s opposite number Bryan Elliott had a great game; in the other game, Detroit, who muddled into the playoffs, went down 3-1 in Anaheim; Teemu Selane got his 42nd playoffs goal, one for every year he has spent on this earth; loads of great listener questions in the Bodeans Mailbag; another cracker of a game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan have such an understanding of sport that they have acheived the status of near-infallable sages. Lacking Mike this week they're joined by a man whose powers of prediciton match their own, Erik Janssen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nat makes musical recommendations and airs his Transformers obsession; Dan does 300 things for 3 points, they're all amazing; HdP spends the week in the Shame Cupboard due to fouling up getting Americarnage's WWE correspondant on the phone; the NBA has around 6 games in the regular season left, but the East is all but decided &amp;ndash; Miami have won it and they&amp;rsquo;ll be joined in the first round by Indiana, New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston and Milwaukee; in the NHL there are around 9 games of the strike shortened season - in the East, Pittsburgh lead, having won 29 of 39 games. They&amp;rsquo;re followed by the Canadiens and incredibly, the once dead and buried Washington Caps. Currently, although the Flyers are 5 points adrift of a playoff space, the whole of the East could still make it theoretically; loads of action from the Bodeans Mailbag, another cracking game from Dan and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan briefly think back those halcyon days of summer last year when Mike forever gained the love of all sports fans at the Olympic basketball - his clip is in the top 5 sporting moments of 2012 according to the BBC website.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Dan are soldiers, they power on through while all around them fall. So when Nat is taken out and would-be guest Tom Bell is felled by a squirty virus while actually on his way to the studio they man up and make a two-hander. Well, two and a quarter as HdP chips in a bit more than either usual or prudent. Pray we're back up to strength next week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike talks art; Dan talks films; HdP talks whisky; Americarnage talks about what you should be up to this saturday in London and how we can get you a discount; Manti Te'o talks... well, not much; Joe Flacco talks muche dinero; many players talk Franchise; many others don't; in the NBA Miami talk sweeping the board - last night, they beat the T-Wolves for their 15th straight win &amp;ndash; a franchise record for a franchise that wins a LOT; Wade grabbed 32 and 10 assists and Lebron, who some say is injured, got 20; in the land of ice and pucks, in the East Montreal lead Pittsburgh and Carolina, in the West it&amp;rsquo;s Chicago, Anaheim, and Vancouver; loads of good talk from the Bodeans Mailbag; great game from Dan - Killer Lines - and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are so fired up about the Super Bowl that they temporarily forget it even exists. Luckily memory snaps back as Mike's off to New Orleans for the Beeb, Nat's off the Superbash as host and Dan and HdP will be heading there too - joined by Americarnage's sideline reporter and this week's very special guest Tom Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nat gives an insight into what it's like to sideline report the darts for ESPN; Mike gets weirded out by stupid tube posters; Dan's now seen all films ever made and a few that haven't been yet; the Pro Bowl happened, underwhelming doesn't even cover it; the 49ers are supposed to be a lock for the title but how will they go about winning it?; NBA-wise the All Star starters were announced last week, but we sort of ignored them but it was the same old stars: Wade and Lebron joined by Garnet, Rondo and Mello; Miami lead the East, San Antonio lead the West; the Kings will be the Supersonics sooner rather than later. The Maloof family have agreed to sell them for 525m despite Forbes magazine estimating that they are worth just over half that; TOm Bell's Bane impression is back; in the NHL the Chicago Blackhawks have started this shortened season unlike any other in their history. They are now 6-0 after beating the Red Wings in overtime on Sunday; taso unbeaten are the San Jose Sharks &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re 5-0 and on Sunday they beat the only other unbeaten team, the Cannucks; New York Yankees &amp;amp; Mike Carlson fave Alex Rodriguez has hired an attorney and is denying involvement after his name was linked to a place which dispensed performace enhancers. Yikes; loads of fun from the Bodeans Mailbag; Superbowl drinking games and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are not folks to be defeated by adverse weather, except for last week when it was just part of the mix and Dan thinks he's got a solution for this - Playground Style...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike and Dan arm-wrestle, at least I think that's what they're doing; Kelly-Anne has offered cupcakes for various hockey results - this can only be a good thing; Dan is playing the Oscar Game again so never leaves the cinema; Nat gives love to the sadly departed Stan the Man; Superbowl 47 will be the Harbowl between the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens, after two sort of rookies made the Bowl in their sort of first seasons; Colin Kaepernick turned in the greatest rushing performances by a quarterback in the playoffs &amp;ndash; by picking up 181 yards, including a 56 yard touchdown; Baltimore, who left it until the last thirty seconds to turns around the Denver game, went long again and threw over the New England secondary over and over again; in coaching news - Chip Turner is the Eagles coach. Bruce Arians has gone to the Cardinals; Mante Te-&amp;lsquo;o knows how to pick &amp;lsquo;em; in the NBA, having won four straight against the Pistons, the Knicks go out early and it stayed that way; the Heat still lead the Knicks; in the West OKC lead the Clippers and the Spurs but the Conference leader could change three times this week, that&amp;rsquo;s how tight it is; in the new short NHL season the Pittsburgh Penguins are off to a Flyer &amp;ndash; literally, beating the Flyers 3-1 in the season opener; best rookie so far is probably Vladmir Tarsenko of the St Louis Blues, who has five points and three goals in two games; loads of Bodeans Mailbag action and a game from Dan - Crazy Bets...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan love discipline - flags, fines, police action - they love it all! After last week's deeply offensive outing Nat has decided that he's better off at the darts for ESPN and Mike appoints himself the new sheriff in town, come to clean up acts and take names. The first name he takes is of this week's guest, Giants fan and very funny man David Whitney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: Dan mistakes Mike's injury for personal violation; Mike tests the limits of his love for Kelly-Ann; Wildcard weekend is over, but not before claiming some casualties; in Houston &amp;ndash; entertainment was the casualty, as the Texans ground out a repeat of last year, beating the dogged Bengals; the Vikings surprise everyone by starting Joe Webb who started well but collapsed in a horrifying pile of misses and interceptions; Baltimore got all sentimental over the return of Chuck Pagano and Ray Lewis&amp;rsquo; last home game ever. Playing with a bizarre metal claw, Lewis looked patchy as Ray Rice gave up two interceptions before the Ravens finally pulled away; RG3 lost out to Russell Wilson in Washington and may have lost more than the game; in the NBA Miami lead the East from New York, OKC lead the West from the LA Clippers who are back on form with two straight; the Bostol Celtics are busy slapping referees around; Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry was fined 15,000 dollars for handing officials a copy of the game on DVD. It was deemed to be inappropriate interactions with officials; The NHL is back and likely to start a 48 game season on the 19th January after 16 hours of negotiations on Saturday; without boring you the details are: the players share of revenues is down from 57 to 50. The owners wanted them to take 46%; lots of fun from the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat and Dan are back and in many ways it seems that the peace and love of the Christmas season have had a profound effect on them - they now want to offend literally everyone in the world. Iron Mike is on IR with a dodgy tooth so who did we call? Marek Larwood of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan watched a zillion films over Christmas, he talks about some of them; Marek gets burnt by his local swimming pool, Dan offers to help him sue the council; Nat flags up Stand Up Guys, out next year, then things get a bit odd; it's Wildcard week and the most surprising entrant is the Texans &amp;ndash; until last week top of the AFC, they slumped to a loss against Andrew Luck and Indy; they&amp;rsquo;ll play the Bengals, who beat the Ravens, who will host Indy; on Black Monday Chan Galey got his marching orders in Buffalo, Andy Reid got it in Philly but may be about to take over in Arizona after Rod Graves and Ken Whisenhunt were shown the door; in the NBA, Miami lead the East, OKC lead the West but the big news is that somebody finally beat the Clippers! The other team in LA lost to the Denver Nuggets on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day; Steve Nash returned for the Lakers and helped Kobe to 34 points in his 15th Christmas game, which finished with a great Pau Gasol dunk and which h happened because of the Knicks&amp;rsquo; weird Christmas day vests;&amp;nbsp; the NHL lockout has reached its 109th day and Dan bores himself telling us; loads of Bodeans Mailbag action and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan work their arses off all year to bring you quality(?) entertainment, 48 shows in 2012 and each one riddled with top analysis and elegant profanity. For the 49th show they figured they'd done enough and locked HdP in the studio with orders to collect up some of the best bits of 2012 for a clip show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In characteristic style he did a &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;just-about-passable&lt;/span&gt; brilliant job and so we present you Lazy-Ass Clip Show 2: Lazier, Assier, Clippier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year from all at Americarnage and we'll be taping a brand new show next week once hangovers have abated slightly, see you then...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are full of festive cheer - to an almost disturbing level in Hollywood's case - and adding to their festive joy is that they're joined by actress, presenter and mistress of sporting trivia Kelly-Anne Lyons. It's a 'Carnage Christmas alright...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The playoff picture took shape with two games to go as the Texans cemented their place at the top of AFC South with an impressive win over Indy; in the NFC the Falcons shut out the Giants in a replay of last year's embarrassingly one sided wildcard; the Cowboys beat the Steelers in overtime and the Redskins beat the Browns, meaning that the NFC East is in a kinky threeway at the top; in the NBA, the New York Knicks lead Miami in the East, with the Knicks having not dropped a game at home all season; Scratch that because last night Jeremy Lin returned to New York City with his new chums in Houston less than a year after he leapt off the bench, only to end up on Houston bench behind James Harden; in the MLB more crazy trading going down as teams shed and acquire players more frequently than Harry Da Producer lands restraining orders; NHL's still locked out and we're ever so excited about hte legal wrangling; lots of goodness in the Bodeans Mailbag, another great game from Dna and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wonderful isn't it?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: Mike stars in Wayne's World on monday night but isn't Wayne or Garth; he's been in a lift with Jaime Lee Curtis though and said nothing in any way rude; Hollywood spent a weekend watching documentaries, quite a few by Vice magazine. Yes, I know, but they're gooood; Nat isn't a hipster, he's a genuine old man; great dissection of the Marquez - Pacquiao fight; love for the listeners who gave us love on iTunes; Brett Ellis gets some love and some hate; was the Texans - Pats really the bes t game ever on Monday Night Football; NFC East tightens up and the Bengals get a check; NFC North get s more interesting too, poor old Lions; Braylon Edwards makes the most hilarious deal ever; the AFC is weak and patchy but hell, you knew that; the Colts are working bizarrely well though; the deals in the MLB have gone mental and the Dodgers, amongst others, are spending all the money in the world; the Knicks are hilarious; the Wizards are more so but for different reasons; Dan gives us a great game based in no way on Lost in Translation; loads of good questions in the Bodeans Mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan love a good trip to the States, a chance to visit places they love and places they've never been - maybe catch a couple of games while they're at it. Imagine their jealousy then when friend of the show Marek Larwood comes along to tell them all about his trip, and how it fades when they realise he went to Detroit and Buffalo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: Mike thinks of strange things while watching films; Nat is genuine about something, people worry; Dan appears to be sponsored by Cineworld; things get fouler than usual at one point - you've been warned; in one of the best games this year the Colts beat the Lions with no time left on the clock as Luck and co overcame a 13 point deficit late on; the 49ers and the Rams came within a couple of minutes of tying for the second time this season&amp;hellip; Greg Zuerlain didn&amp;rsquo;t fluff his lines second time around; the Chiefs put Saturday&amp;rsquo;s appalling events behind them, and ground out a win against the Panthers; in the NBA Miami lead the East, Memphis Grizzlies still lead the West; the battle of New York continues, with the Knicks replacing the Nets at the top of the Atlantic; Andrew Bynum is still on the sidelines for 76ers who don&amp;rsquo;t need him when Thaddues Young is blocking everything in his path; loadsa questions from the Bodeans Mailbag; crap sporting cameos form the basis of a game and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Nat are bereft as Holywood Dan takes the Premier League football option and doesn't make it to the studio this week. To mask their distress they pretend it doesn't matter to them but the hurt is ever close to the surface. To help them through this difficult time they invite ESPN America head honcho (he honches heads you know) and College Football supremo Patrick 'Paddy the Brick' Sturgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The refs are back and it's already easy to forget how bad the first few weeks were; Patrick knows about betting but urges you to just join him 'for the journey'; Mike watches Japanes films; Patrick does Zumba, the guys are confused; the Podcast Awards have come around again, feel free to nominate us; Jay Cutler is a winner; Romo gets picked off all over the field; the Patriots score more points than is seemly; the Jest have 34 reasons to think about what they're doing; Chuck Pagano is getting treatment for leukemia and we all wish him strength and wellness; Patrick talks us through the College ball situation; the Tigers punched their playoff ticket by winning the American League Central on Monday night; the White Sox put some pressure on them by beating Cleveland; Detroit responded with a 6-3 win in Kansas City the NHL is still locked out, silly buggers; fantasy league news, your questions in the Bodeans mailbag and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike and Dan are a pair of horse-collaring, facemask pulling unnecessarily rough low-blockers and with Nat out with a tooth injury, Harry the Producer is left to rain flags down like the ill-informed scab ref he is. Luckily for everyone stand-up comic, Bills fan and all-round awesome guy Lee Bannard is in the studio this week to keep the guys on the straight and true...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news: Dan's watched some films, they were good; Mike's watched some films, they're also good but what the hell is it with Scandawegians and bad things happening to kids? Scab refs are barely mentioned; they're barely mentioned when disallowing touchdowns; they're barely mentioned throwing endless random penalty flags in Baltimore; they're barely mentioned having absolutely no grip on games; they're ba... you get the idea; the Bengals are exciting; the 49ers are still everyone's pick despite losing; the Cardinals, Texans and Falcons are the only 3-0 teams; nothing hapens in Hockey because of the lockout; there are now no Chinese players in the NBA and this can be said about over a hundred other countries but China is quite literally a Big Deal; Yanqui are up, Oakland are on the up, Washington have a playoff place, so have Cincinatti and the Giants; the MVP race hots up, Americarnage puts its money on Melky Cabrera; loads of questions in the Bodeans Mailbag; Dan brings the worst accents in Hollywood and asks Mike and Lee to guess who they are and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nat, Mike and Dan are multitalented guys. Violent, unpredictable, multitalented guys. This week they demonstrate this by revealing new skills, old methods of greeting, new things about old films, new things about new sport and much more besides. They're aided in this rollercoaster ride by the incomparable Luke Moore of The Football Ramble who fits in with this bunch of reprobates with disturbing ease...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: In-jokes from off-air are not good, ignore them; books have been read, some of them are good; Mike keeps things light; Luke gets and gives updates on his newly-aquired American Sports teams; there are gratuitous Kid'n'Play references; Luck and RGIII finally sign on the dotted line; training camps have finally started for most, pre-season is offically not far away; ridiculously complex deals are going on in the NHL, only Dan understands them; corrections and clarifications causes issues again; listener questions in the Bodeans Mailbag; new game: Sweary Bollocks - Best. Game. Ever. and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;********STOP PRESS********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a variety of work, personal, Olympic and crack-related commitments there will be no Americarnage next week. Sorry folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mike and Dan make their glorious return to the studio in lovely Camden Town but find that the host's chair is empty as Nat's taking his turn in the Americarnage isolation hut for a week of nihilistic shouting along the lines of 'Tebow for President'. Meanwhile, back in reality, the guys are joined by friend of the show, ex-pat Canadian and the man who will bring you the Olympic Rhythmic Gymnastics, Erik Janssen. Hurrah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news: The Tree of Life is a contentious film; Dan loves The Walking Dead; in the MLB it's the All-Star game and by the time you read/listen to this all excitement will have faded; the final 3 players have been picked for the Dream Team at the Olympics; Steve Nash has been traded to the Lakers; the Phoenix Coyotes are in trouble again, the midwest love-affair with hockey is still in question; the Wild pick up Sutter in a bit of a coup, making them contenders all of a sudden; other things happen, they're exciting; your questions in the Bodeans Mailbag; 80's movie theme tune game leaves Carlson pissed off and much, much more...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Dan is awesome at NBA2K12; swearing seems to be cool all of a sudden; The draft played out pretty much as expected &amp;ndash; Luck first, RG3 second and Matt Kalil 3rd (although Washington later drafted Kirk Cousins, creating a QB competition before the season even began); Carlson eats a banana and an amazing transformation occurs - Mike is the Draft Doctor; The NHL Conference Semi Finals are under way after last week&amp;rsquo;s remaining games were resolved in game seven; Washington turned over the holders, the Boston Bruins in overtime of game 7 after Joel Ward slammed home the winner...; The NBA playoffs are underway! The talk is off Heat vs Knicks in the first round. It&amp;rsquo;s 2-0 Miami already and Amar&amp;rsquo;e could be out of the series after he punched a fire extinguisher and cut him hand! Nutter!

&lt;p&gt;In other news: Nat checks the state of his chair; fun and frolics in Three Points; Mike's Mock Draft makes sense as far as these things go; Philadelphia Flyers overcome Cup favourites Sidney Crosby&amp;rsquo;s Penguins (as correctly predicted on Americarnage); other things happen that we predicted; some things happen that we didn't, but not many; New Jersey and Florida are going to game seven; Ottawa and New York too and Washington and Boston won&amp;rsquo;t give up; in the NBA, Chicago win the East, Miami second, despite stuttering forms towards the end of the season; In the West, an incredible push has put San Antonio back on top, relegating OKC, who will now probably play Dallas; Peace no more. Metta World Peace is back to his old tricks, elbowing James Harden in the face while celebrating the dunk; A perfect game for Philip Humbert's White Sox - the 21st in MLB history - he got a call from President Obama, who's a devoted White Sox fan; Luke hears some comedic racism from the gang, and much, much more....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nothing more to say about that...; so let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the New York Knicks!

&lt;p&gt;Coombs is absent but has a note so Mike slips into the still-warm host chair and by popular demand he and Dan are joined by the master of sports production and Americarnage's first ever repeat-guest, Erik Janssen. More worryingly, they're also joined by Vladimir Putin who outlines his views on the London riots and tackles the NBA round-up.&lt;/p&gt;
