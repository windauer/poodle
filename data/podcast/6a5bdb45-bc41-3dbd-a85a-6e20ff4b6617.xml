                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Having an injury can be one of the most frustrating things that can happen to an athlete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not everyday that it happens, but it’s something that happens to us all at some point or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever you find yourself with an injury make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- See a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;
- Figure out what hurts and what doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;br /&gt;
- Make the injury a positive. Address weaknesses.&lt;br /&gt;
- Rehab injured area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know that you’re probably not going to hurt yourself further by continuing to workout, you have a world of opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out what doesn’t hurt, and make if your mission to improve that aspect of your fitness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago when I had a back injury I made it my mission to improve my upper body movements, as well as any leg movements that didn’t aggravate my lower back.  It sucked that I couldn’t do some of my favorite exercises, such as squats and deadlifts, but I am now a better athlete because of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about how to Workout with an Injury, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to figure out what exercises you can and cannot do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make the injury a positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to keep from getting injured in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This episode of the All Around Joe podcast comes from a listener question.  Logan Gray asks… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we gain weight and improve strength, while maintaining mobility, and improving gymnastics movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question, and one that most CrossFitters want to know the answer to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really a simpler answer than you’d think…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gain weight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by eating a ton of food.  I like people to get 1 gram of protein per pound of desired body weight.  Then matching that number with your fat consumption.  And last, eating carbs based on your energy needs.  It’s usually around 30% protein, 30% fat, and 40% carbs.  But the fat can increase, and carbs and decrease based on energy needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improve strength&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up… lift heavy weights (always using good form), using large muscle groups in multi-joint movements.  Think squats, deadlifts, bench presses, cleans, and snatches, etc.  Find an off season strength program to follow, and get to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maintain mobility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that most people don’t realize, is that mobility can be gained from lifting weights (even heavy weights).  Yep, true story.  What you need to do is lift weights through full ranges of motion.  Those half squats just aren’t going to cut it.  Make sure that you have a neutral spine, and then squat as low as you can get.  Doing this you’ll find that your mobility actually will increase over time.  It’s awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Improve gymnastic movements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the trickiest part of the equation.  When you get heavier, gymnastics movements suffer.  Sorry!  But what you can do is pay extra attention to having amazing gymnastics movement patterns.  Study Carl Paoli at &lt;a href=”http://gymnasticswod.com”&gt;http://gymnasticswod.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Carl can show you how to improve your gymnastics movement patterns, which will make the movements easier.  So, the goal is to get better at your gymnastics form, knowing that the movements will get harder when you gain weight.  But at some point you will want to get ready for the CrossFit Open (usually starting in Nov. or Dec.), and increase your metabolic condition.  When you increase your metabolic conditioning, there’s a good chance you’ll also lose some of that body fat that you put on while gaining weight/strength.  Once the body weight comes off, the gymnastics will get much easier.  And you’ll be stronger, and have better movement patterns.  It will be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about how to Gain weight/strength/mobility/gymnastics, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much to eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to increase mobility through weight lifting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s important when doing gymnastics when gaining weight.&lt;/li&gt;

How can we gain weight and improve strength, while maintaining mobility, and improving gymnastics movements.

This is a great question, and one that most CrossFitters want to know the answer to.  

It’s really a simpler answer than you’d think…

And last, eating carbs based on your energy needs.  It’s usually around 30% protein, 30% fat, and 40% carbs.  But the fat can increase, and carbs and decrease based on energy needs. 

Improve strength
Next up… lift heavy weights (always using good form), using large muscle groups in multi-joint movements.  Think squats, deadlifts, bench presses, cleans, and snatches, etc.  Find an off season strength program to follow, and get to work. 

Maintain mobility
Something that most people don’t realize, is that mobility can be gained from lifting weights (even heavy weights).  Yep, true story.  What you need to do is lift weights through full ranges of motion.  Those half squats just aren’t going to cut it.  Make sure that you have a neutral spine, and then squat as low as you can get.  Doing this you’ll find that your mobility actually will increase over time.  It’s awesome!

Improve gymnastic movements
This is the trickiest part of the equation.  When you get heavier, gymnastics movements suffer.  Sorry!  But what you can do is pay extra attention to having amazing gymnastics movement patterns.  Study Carl Paoli at http://gymnasticswod.com.  Carl can show you how to improve your gymnastics movement patterns, which will make the movements easier.  So, the goal is to get better at your gymnastics form, knowing that the movements will get harder when you gain weight.  But at some point you will want to get ready for the CrossFit Open (usually starting in Nov. or Dec.), and increase your metabolic condition.  When you increase your metabolic conditioning, there’s a good chance you’ll also lose some of that body fat that you put on while gaining weight/strength.  Once the body weight comes off, the gymnastics will get much easier.  And you’ll be stronger, and have better movement patterns.  It will be awesome!

In this episode you learn about how to Gain weight/strength/mobility/gymnastics, plus...

	What to eat.
	How much to eat.
	How to increase mobility through weight lifting.
	What’s important when doing gymnastics when gaining weight.

&lt;p&gt;You might be a competitor, and want to make it to Regionals, or the CrossFit Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you might want to simply get better, and see more results faster at you local CrossFit box.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the important things to consider if you want to become a better CrossFit athlete at any level&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Use great technique&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be common sense, but you’d be surprised how many people sacrifice form for going faster.  Trust me when I say, it’s just not worth it.  You will eventually end up injured and sitting on the CrossFit bench.  Have you coaches help you with good technique, and watch videos of other top CrossFit and Olympic lifting athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Watch videos of other top athletes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Workout with athletes that are better than you are&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you need to leave your pride at the door.  It’s fun to win workouts, but if you’re winning them all the time (and not a Games athlete) then you need to consider who you’re working out with.  You will get better faster if you’re working out with people who are stronger and faster than you are.  If this means finding a different gym, do it.  Or it could mean following a blog where you post your weights and times against other athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Go to athletes camps&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to camps like Invictus, Coach B Oly clinic, or local camps that sound interesting.  You can always learn something new.  I was recently at an Invictus athletes camp, and learned a small nugget that completely changed the way that I snatch.  It was AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Follow other athletes on Twitter&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound just like the videos section above, but it’s a little different.  The reason is… Twitter is different.  What does that mean?  Twitter is very unique in that it allows regular people to contact almost anyone.  Well, with the exception of super celebrities, but they might even answer you sometimes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend following the athletes that you look up to, and when appropriate ask them questions related to things they are posting about.  You’ll be surprised how many responses you get.  Just make sure that you don’t abuse this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Work really hard!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you need to give 100% when you are working out, eating, resting, taking supplements, etc.  If if has to do with becoming a better CrossFit athlete you need to work really hard at it.  You’ll benefit if you take this practice into all your life endeavors.  &lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be a few of you out there that are thinking… “I’ll never do a CrossFit competition, why should I listen to this?”.  And for those of you thinking that, never say never.  Even my 60+ year old mother does CrossFit competitions, and has a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrossFit competitions are full of energetic, inspiring, fun loving people.  And most competitions have divisions for all skill levels.  So you don’t have to be a CrossFit professional to have fun at a CrossFit competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… if you decide to do a CrossFit competition here are some things that you should think about beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get strong &amp;#8211; As with most activities, being stronger is never a bad thing.  So plan your training cycles to have strength components.  These can include: squats, deadlifts, bench and overhead presses, cleans, snatches, jerks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add endurance training &amp;#8211; A well rounded CrossFit athlete will be not only strong, but also able to work for long periods of time without getting too tired.  I’ve found that the best way to get this endurance up is to add additional training to your regular CrossFit workout.  So 2-4 times a week add 20-40 mins of running, biking, rowing, swimming, etc to build up that extra endurance.  You’ll thank me when you do your competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Train hard &amp;#8211; This is simply stating that you should be training as hard as you can with good form.  Give 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat more a few days out &amp;#8211; As your competition approaches increase the amount of food that you’re consuming.  Most competitions will increase the total amount of work that your body is used to handling, so this will get your body ready nutritionally for that extra work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring foods to the comp that won’t upset your stomach &amp;#8211; Basically bring foods to the competition that you’re used to eating.  Don’t try eating something that you’re not used to on competition day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you usual protein and sugar post workout drink on hand &amp;#8211; After each event you should be thinking about refueling, and in almost all cases the best thing to have is your usual post workout protein and sugar concoction.  Mine is Progenex Recovery and dextrose powder.  If you have 3 workouts throughout the day, you could have this 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep extra &amp;#8211; If you can get an extra hour or two of sleep a few nights before your CrossFit competition do it, and especially get an extra hour or two if you have a multi-day competition, during the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm up before the competition, but not too warm &amp;#8211; This just means, go through your usual workout warm up before your event.  I see people doing whole workouts before they do their events because they are so excited, and then being tired during the actual event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After event, talk about/journal what you’d change &amp;#8211; This is a time to reflect on what you did good, and what you could have done better.  Get it all out of you.  This is priceless going into your next competition, and daily workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refeed &amp;#8211; Eat, eat, eat!  Like I mentioned above, a comp will probably take more out of you than a regular workout, so make sure you give your body the nutrition it needs after the comp.  This might be a good time to plan your cheat day&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about how to prepare for a CrossFit competition, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do leading up the competition, the day before, during, and after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to eat and fuel yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more.&lt;/li&gt;

There might be a few of you out there that are thinking… “I’ll never do a CrossFit competition, why should I listen to this?”.  And for those of you thinking that, never say never.  Even my 60+ year old mother does CrossFit competitions, and has a blast.

CrossFit competitions are full of energetic, inspiring, fun loving people.  And most competitions have divisions for all skill levels.  So you don’t have to be a CrossFit professional to have fun at a CrossFit competition.

So… if you decide to do a CrossFit competition here are some things that you should think about beforehand. 

Get strong - As with most activities, being stronger is never a bad thing.  So plan your training cycles to have strength components.  These can include: squats, deadlifts, bench and overhead presses, cleans, snatches, jerks, etc.

Add endurance training - A well rounded CrossFit athlete will be not only strong, but also able to work for long periods of time without getting too tired.  I’ve found that the best way to get this endurance up is to add additional training to your regular CrossFit workout.  So 2-4 times a week add 20-40 mins of running, biking, rowing, swimming, etc to build up that extra endurance.  You’ll thank me when you do your competition. 

Train hard - This is simply stating that you should be training as hard as you can with good form.  Give 100%.

Eat more a few days out - As your competition approaches increase the amount of food that you’re consuming.  Most competitions will increase the total amount of work that your body is used to handling, so this will get your body ready nutritionally for that extra work. 

Bring foods to the comp that won’t upset your stomach - Basically bring foods to the competition that you’re used to eating.  Don’t try eating something that you’re not used to on competition day. 

Have you usual protein and sugar post workout drink on hand - After each event you should be thinking about refueling, and in almost all cases the best thing to have is your usual post workout protein and sugar concoction.  Mine is Progenex Recovery and dextrose powder.  If you have 3 workouts throughout the day, you could have this 3 times.

Sleep extra - If you can get an extra hour or two of sleep a few nights before your CrossFit competition do it, and especially get an extra hour or two if you have a multi-day competition, during the competition. 

Warm up before the competition, but not too warm - This just means, go through your usual workout warm up before your event.  I see people doing whole workouts before they do their events because they are so excited, and then being tired during the actual event.

After event, talk about/journal what you’d change - This is a time to reflect on what you did good, and what you could have done better.  Get it all out of you.  This is priceless going into your next competition, and daily workouts. 

Refeed - Eat, eat, eat!  Like I mentioned above, a comp will probably take more out of you than a regular workout, so make sure you give your body the nutrition it needs after the comp.  This might be a good time to plan your cheat day...


In this episode you learn about how to prepare for a CrossFit competition, plus...

	What to do leading up the competition, the day before, during, and after.
	How to eat and fuel yourself.
	Recovery.
	And much more.

&lt;p&gt;What happens is you work hard in the gym, or in some physical way, and you create micro tears in your muscles.  These micro tears are small damages to the muscle that cause that still “sore” feeling.  As long as the tears aren’t too big, they are actually a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ll find is the soreness is a sign that your muscles will be adapting, and coming back stronger in the days to come.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it is a good idea to try to recover from the soreness as fast as you can.  And get back to your awesome feeling self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do to get on the recovery track is… move.  Yep, get moving.  This doesn’t have to be anything too hard.  Just some simple jogging, hiking, swimming, etc. is a great way to get the blood flowing through your sore muscles.  The new blood flow will bring with it nutrients that will help you muscles recover faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less active things that you can do to get your muscles to recovery from soreness are: salt baths, massages, foam rolling, smashing, rest, and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this country type 2 diabetes is a serious problem.  And I believe that we can prevent it by simply educating people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now our school system does a terrible job of teaching people how to be healthy, and in turn how to avoid type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you understand what type 2 diabetes is… It’s when your body has usable carbs floating around in your blood, but no need for those carbs.  Because there is no need for the carbs, your body stops producing the insulin that shuttles those carbs to muscles and fat. Then you have those carbs just chilling out in your body with no where to go, and this causes all kinds of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to experience those problems, and some simple actions can keep them from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you can do is give your body a reason to need the carbs.  The easiest way to give your body a need for carbs is to do some resistance training.  This could be body weight resistance, or weight lifting.  Anything that’s under 2 mins per set, or activity will cause a need for the carbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing you can do is think of carbs like fuel for your muscles.  The analogy that I like to use is… Carbs are like gasoline.  Would you put gasoline in your car if the tank was on full?  Of course not.  So don’t put carbs in your body if you aren’t working out.  Your body just doesn’t need them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things you can do is limit the number of bad carbs you consume at all times.  These are sugars, grains, and some fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you can start thinking of your body as a machine, the better, and healthier you’ll become.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need motivation, google type 2 diabetes pictures.  You won’t like what you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about how to avoid type 2 diabetes, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What carbs are used for in your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What carbs you should be eating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What carbs you should be avoiding.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m the type of person that finds out why these products are better than the rest.  There’s always a reason.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of the AllAroundJoe podcast I interview the &lt;a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx.com" target="_blank"&gt;Blonyx HMB + Creatine&lt;/a&gt; creator Rowan Minnion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as you’ll hear in the podcast Rowan is an exceptional thinker who went about creating the &lt;a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx hmb + creatine" target="_blank"&gt;Blonyx HMB + Creatine&lt;/a&gt; product in a very unique way.  A very smart way!  He studied which supplements had the most conclusive research done on them, and the two that jumped out far above the rest were… you guessed it… HMB and creatine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were HMB and creatine the most studied (by a wide margin), but they also had the most positive results.  Long term, and short term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowan essentially reverse engineered the supplement creation process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than going after the product that had the most hype, he went after the product that he knew would work the best, HMB and creatine.  From there he sourced the highest quality HMB and creatine products for Blonyx HMB + Creatine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowan also talks about how they hand make their product to guarantee the highest purity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really an amazing interview that I highly recommend that you listen to for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you can get 10% off you &lt;a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx" target="_blank"&gt;Blonyx&lt;/a&gt; products by using the code: AllAroundJoe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why &lt;a href="http://allaroundjoe.com/blonyx" title="Blonyx.com" target="_blank"&gt;Blonyx&lt;/a&gt; chose HMB and creatine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you should be taking HMB and creatine over other supplements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How scary the supplement industry can be.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking…  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a bold statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you’re right, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a serious problem if people think it’s a good idea to eat cotton balls for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard that some celebrities are doing it, and it’s always a good idea to do what celebrities do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kills me is that someone will eat cotton balls with orange juice instead of simply eating right, and exercising for a few hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really that simple.  Really!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… maybe it’s not those peoples fault.  Maybe it’s the school systems that aren’t teaching people about nutrition and exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did go to San Diego State University to get my degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in fitness, nutrition, and health, BUT can tell you that the majority of what actually works I learned on my own through self testing, and reading about others self testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that tells me that our education system, even at the highest level, is pretty messed up as it comes to nutrition and exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I have titled this “why you’re not in shape”.  If nothing else to get your attention, and force some education down your throat.  No one else is going to do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think our education system needs a serious overhaul let me know.  I want to hear it in the comments below.  Tell me what you learned in school.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is supposed to get you ready for “real life”, right?  Did it work?  Do you know how go gain or lose weight when you want to? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn why you’re not in shape, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To look at what you eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to look at how much you eat (protein, fat carbs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much you need to exercise.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>I know what you’re thinking…  

That’s a bold statement.

And you’re right, it is.

But I just heard that there’s a new diet out there where people are eating cotton balls with orange juice to lose weight.  Read full story here. 

Are you kidding me?

There’s a serious problem if people think it’s a good idea to eat cotton balls for any reason.

I heard that some celebrities are doing it, and it’s always a good idea to do what celebrities do….

What kills me is that someone will eat cotton balls with orange juice instead of simply eating right, and exercising for a few hours a week.

It’s really that simple.  Really!

You know what…

… maybe it’s not those peoples fault.  Maybe it’s the school systems that aren’t teaching people about nutrition and exercise.  

It could be.

I did go to San Diego State University to get my degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in fitness, nutrition, and health, BUT can tell you that the majority of what actually works I learned on my own through self testing, and reading about others self testing.

So, that tells me that our education system, even at the highest level, is pretty messed up as it comes to nutrition and exercise.  

That’s why I have titled this “why you’re not in shape”.  If nothing else to get your attention, and force some education down your throat.  No one else is going to do it!

If you think our education system needs a serious overhaul let me know.  I want to hear it in the comments below.  Tell me what you learned in school.  

School is supposed to get you ready for “real life”, right?  Did it work?  Do you know how go gain or lose weight when you want to? 

In this episode you learn why you’re not in shape, plus...

	To look at what you eat.
	How to look at how much you eat (protein, fat carbs).
	How much you need to exercise.
	What kind of exercise you need to be doing.
Who to hangout with to get into shape.
What kind of exercise you need to be doing.

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s not often that a day goes by when I don’t get asked a question about how to get motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For some reason motivation to workout is something that people struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For me this has always been easy, and today I’m going to share my motivational strategies with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Post picture of people you want to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You can easily find these picture in magazines, or on the internet. &#160;Then post them in places that you will see them daily. &#160;I have pictures posted as the desktop background of my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Write down your fitness goal daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Do this at the start of each day, and you’ll notice that it sets the tone for the whole day ahead. &#160;Even if something throws you off, you’ve already set your target for the day, and accomplishing it becomes so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Find a motivated workout partner to feed off of. Remember, we are who we hang around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Look into your circle of friends, and start to hangout with your buddy who works out all the time. &#160;If you don’t have any of these friends… go to the gym, and just strike up friendly conversations. &#160;This will create a new group of friends that is into the healthy lifestyle that you want to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Visualize your success daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Right after writing your goal, or right before you fall asleep, close your eyes and visualized yourself already accomplishing the goals that you have set for yourself. &#160;Do this everyday, and you’ll start to see those results come easier and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Measure your progress weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This can be done via a body fat test, or simply writing down the progress in your visual appearance. &#160;Write this down in the same journal that you use for your goal writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bonus! Find someone that you want to impress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li dir="ltr"&gt;Find a girl or guy that you’d like to impress and think about them during your workouts, or when you’re struggling to get to the gym. &#160;This could be someone that you like, or your husband or wife. &#160;The motivation of wanting to impress someone can be incredibly powerful. &#160;Use this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

For some reason motivation to workout is something that people struggle with.

For me this has always been easy, and today I’m going to share my motivational strategies with you.


	
Post picture of people you want to look like.

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How to prepare mentally is something that can be related to almost any part of your life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this podcast (and post) we’re talking about how to prepare mentally for getting to the gym, performing at the gym, and endurance/marathons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental preparation that will get you into the gym involves writing down your goals, finding pictures of people that you want to looks like, and putting those things in front of you consistently.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must know your why.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you really want to look good, feel good, and be healthy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My why is that I want to be the absolute best that I can be, and I want to show others what is possible.  To inspire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re talking about preparing to perform great in the gym, it’s about visualizing the completion of your goals.  Really making them a reality in your mind.  And… presenting the body language that inspires confidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the mental preparation for doing endurance races is similar to performing well in the gym.  Seeing your self complete the race in your mind is a must.  It’s also a huge advantage to learn how to meditate during your endurance sports.  Calm your mind and body while moving.  This was a huge asset while I was running 50 mile ultra marathons, and doing Ironman events.  You can really relax, and calm your whole mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details make sure to listen to the podcast, and let me know if you have any questions. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>How to prepare mentally is something that can be related to almost any part of your life.  

But in this podcast (and post) we’re talking about how to prepare mentally for getting to the gym, performing at the gym, and endurance/marathons.

The mental preparation that will get you into the gym involves writing down your goals, finding pictures of people that you want to looks like, and putting those things in front of you consistently.  

You must know your why.  

Why do you really want to look good, feel good, and be healthy?

My why is that I want to be the absolute best that I can be, and I want to show others what is possible.  To inspire!

When we’re talking about preparing to perform great in the gym, it’s about visualizing the completion of your goals.  Really making them a reality in your mind.  And… presenting the body language that inspires confidence.  

Lastly, the mental preparation for doing endurance races is similar to performing well in the gym.  Seeing your self complete the race in your mind is a must.  It’s also a huge advantage to learn how to meditate during your endurance sports.  Calm your mind and body while moving.  This was a huge asset while I was running 50 mile ultra marathons, and doing Ironman events.  You can really relax, and calm your whole mind and body.

For more details make sure to listen to the podcast, and let me know if you have any questions. 

In this episode you learn about How to prepare mentally, plus...

	How to prepare mentally to get into gym.
	How to prepare mentally to perform well at the gym.
	How to prepare mentally for a marathon or endurance in general.
	RPM Speed Ropes.
	Buzz pre workout supplement.

&lt;p&gt;In this episode you’ll learn exactly how to get abs without doing crunches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, it’s much easier to get abs than people think, and doing crunches really isn’t going to help you much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abs are dominantly a support muscle which means they are activated far more when static and supporting than when they are flexed or crunched.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this you will get the most out of your ab development while doing heavy lifts, such as squats, deadlifts, and/or bench press.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also find that building a great set of abs will come much faster with plank exercises than crunches.  And if you want to get really crazy… do a medicine ball plank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, remember that once you have your ab development, abs are built in the kitchen.  Without proper nutrition that will burn off the excess body fat, your abs will never be seen.  Never!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about How to get abs without doing crunches, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What’s your thought on rest days?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that rest days are more important than exercising days…  Well I might be slightly exaggerating about that.  You need the exercise days for the rest and recovery to count.  But once you have the exercise days, you NEED the rest and recovery.  Otherwise you simply won’t get the gains that you so desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this podcast we talk about the exercise teardown.  This is the process of how exercise actually causes damage to your muscles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you get results is because you’ve caused damage to your muscles, and your body makes them stronger so you aren’t able to cause the same damage the next time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda crazy wouldn’t you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talk about overtraining, and how you can avoid it by simply listening to you body.  The tough thing is listening to your body even when you are experiencing amazing gains.  If your body needs rest, you’ve gotta give it rest, or the gains will stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly I talk about the secret for never being anywhere without food.  My secret weapon against hunger…. Almonds.  I bake ‘em myself.  So good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about the psychology of exercise and diet, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exercise teardown .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest and repair.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How there’s no such thing as overtraining, only under recovering.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s something that we cannot ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some HUGE things that you can do to improve the psychology that you have to be successful at exercise and diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that you can do right from the start is, getting into a routine.  The routines that we have in our lives shape the outcomes that we have.  Think about this… your work routine shapes the money that you make.  The food that you eat shapes how much your body weighs.  Your routine communication with your friends creates good or bad relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I know that this doesn’t sound like the most interesting thing ever.  But hold up for a second.  If you can simply change the way you think about exercise and food, you can change your whole life.  This is the truth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about the psychology of exercise and diet, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making exercise a priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting into a routine.  Or how to get addicted to exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to think about food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to let yourself go wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding how things work in your body.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>It’s all about psychology.

The success that you have with exercise and diet is all determined by psychology.

It’s something that we cannot ignore.

There are some HUGE things that you can do to improve the psychology that you have to be successful at exercise and diet. 

Something that you can do right from the start is, getting into a routine.  The routines that we have in our lives shape the outcomes that we have.  Think about this… your work routine shapes the money that you make.  The food that you eat shapes how much your body weighs.  Your routine communication with your friends creates good or bad relationships. 

So I know that this doesn’t sound like the most interesting thing ever.  But hold up for a second.  If you can simply change the way you think about exercise and food, you can change your whole life.  This is the truth!

In this episode you learn about the psychology of exercise and diet, plus...

	Making exercise a priority.
	Getting into a routine.  Or how to get addicted to exercise.
	How to think about food.
	When to let yourself go wild.
	Understanding how things work in your body.

It was all about the workout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that all changed when I started doing the &lt;a href="http://www.crossfitinvictus.com/category/wod/competition/" title="CrossFit Invictus competition programing" target="_blank"&gt;competitive CrossFit training from Invictus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I started realizing was that more was involved in CrossFit recovery than simply taking your post workout supplements, and eating lots of quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the most out of your workout/CrossFit recovery you have to take a number of things seriously. And the biggest starts with listening to your body. If you’re not in-tune with you body, you will never know when your gains are going to stop, and overtraining is going to set in. It can happen faster than you think. And it will stop you in your tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common signs of overtraining are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a hard time sleeping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not wanting to eat even though you should be hungry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having no desire to workout, or do much in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero sex drive. Yep, all gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course, feeling sore, tight, and generally bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t sound too good does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper recovery is a big deal, so listen up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you learn about Workout / CrossFit Recovery, plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can do it with the right training&amp;#8230;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, and the right running form.  Your body is designed to be able to move for long periods of time, but unfortunately with our seated lifestyle we can mess up our naturally good form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing/recording I have run 5 ultramarathons, 2 full Ironman&amp;#8217;s, 1 half Ironman, 1 marathon, and several shorter races.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the training for my ultramarathons, and Ironman&amp;#8217;s I&amp;#8217;ve used the traditional LSD (long slow distance) style of training, and the CrossFit Endurance style of training.  The CrossFit Endurance is a short distance, high intensity style of training that has it&amp;#8217;s positives and it&amp;#8217;s negatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you will learn ultramarathon&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ultramarathon training programs.&lt;/li&gt;

In this episode of the AllAroundJoe podcast I’m going to talk about How to Run an UltraMarathon.  

Anyone can do it with the right training...  

Well, and the right running form.  Your body is designed to be able to move for long periods of time, but unfortunately with our seated lifestyle we can mess up our naturally good form.  

As of this writing/recording I have run 5 ultramarathons, 2 full Ironman's, 1 half Ironman, 1 marathon, and several shorter races.  

During the training for my ultramarathons, and Ironman's I've used the traditional LSD (long slow distance) style of training, and the CrossFit Endurance style of training.  The CrossFit Endurance is a short distance, high intensity style of training that has it's positives and it's negatives. 
 

In this episode you will learn ultramarathon...

     Ultramarathon training programs.
     How to avoid ultramarathon running injuries.
     What ultramarathon races to look into.
	How to run an ultramarathon on a tight schedule.
     How to properly build yourself up for an ultra marathon.

Maybe you feel like you need to be in better shape, or are intimidated, or just need some guidance&amp;#8230;  In this episode you&amp;#8217;ll learn exactly how to start CrossFit.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find all kinds of different CrossFit gyms out there.  This is because CrossFit is an affiliate, and not a franchise.  Meaning, the gyms pay for the use of the CrossFit name, but that&amp;#8217;s about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrossFit gyms can be run with a focus on anything the gym owner wants.  You&amp;#8217;ll find CrossFit gyms that focus on everything from general fitness, to football, to competitive athletics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that large variation of CrossFit gym styles it&amp;#8217;s important in this &amp;#8220;how to start CrossFit&amp;#8221; episode/post that you learn how to find the CrossFit gym that&amp;#8217;s right for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t worry, it&amp;#8217;s not hard.  Just know that you have options, and if you don&amp;#8217;t like one CrossFit gym, the next CrossFit gym could be your dream gym.  I&amp;#8217;ll teach you how to figure that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In this episode you will also learn how to start CrossFit plus&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How to find the right CrossFit gym/box for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What questions you should ask the coach/owner when you start CrossFit.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>Do you want to know what exercises you should be spending your time doing?  I've seen so many people at the gym spending time doing single joint movements and machines that are pretty much a waste of time.  Well, a waste of time if you actually want the most results in the shortest amount of time.  In this episode of the AllAroundJoe Podcast I share with you the best bang for your buck exercises.  They might not be the easiest, but they will get you the most results. 

In this episode you will also learn

     My Progenex Cocoon review.
     How much water you need to be drinking EVERY DAY!
     The major exercises that you should be doing at the gym. If you want results...
     And other fun stuff that I've been up to in my crazy life. :-)
