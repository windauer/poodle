I break down the draft and talk some Free Agency w/ Zach Harper of CBS Sports. Zach as always is a great guest, and we continue on chatting about the LeBron sweepstakes, who’s getting Carmelo, Knicks philosophies, Sixers philosophies, Kevin Love as well. As always you can check this podcast here or on Itunes. Thanks everyone for continuing to listen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;line-height:19px;"&gt;So I guess the NBA offseason has really started to pick up! The Knicks and Mavericks have a deal that seems to be going through involving Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton going to the Mavericks for Jose Calderon, Shane Larkin, Samuel Dalembert, 2 2nd round picks and Wayne Ellington. It’s the 1st trade of the Phil Jackson era, and what will come of it? On the podcast today Rafael Canton of NBA Trades came on t [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s the 1st trade of the Phil Jackson era, and what will come of it? On the podcast today Rafael Canton of NBA Trades came on to discuss the deal and what it means for the Knicks and does this signal the end of Melo as a Knick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;line-height:19px;"&gt;Also we discussed the rest of Free Agency, who fits better for Melo, the Bulls or Rockets? Included is chat on the Heat and what LeBron James will do along with Wade and Bosh, the Kevin Love situation, and Raf’s favorite draft night trades. Take a listen, and many thanks to Raf for coming on, fun conversation as usual. You can listen to this podcast here or go on Itunes to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

What an awful stretch for the Knicks going back to their loss to Cleveland this past Sunday, and as they head to their impending doom, I bring in Chris Herring from the Wall Street Journal to discuss what the hell happened in Los Angeles, Phil Jackson and his thoughts on the Knicks plus them going forward, and a look at Heat/Pacers in the stretch run.

I’m no lawyer, but the simplest and succinct thing I can say is things aren’t going good for Raymond Felton right now. How does this situation affect the Knicks? Will Carmelo leave, and where will he go? A lot of questions, and to wonder with me on the show is&#160;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JakeBrownESPN"&gt;Jake Brown&lt;/a&gt;, who is the host of the Weekend with Jake &amp;#38; Drew for ESPN New Hampshire.

We had to hit everything on the team, including why Mike Woodson stays with the big lineups and why he’s so stubborn. In addition we discussed Iman Shumpert’s struggles and why they’ve been so frequent. A lot of great talk continues with the Knicks point guard play or lack thereof, Melo, the chemistry of the team and where they might end up.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

They’re also the 1st team since 1949 to win their first 5 games without scoring 100 points. After last season’s Eastern Conference Finals appearance, the Pacers are trying to take the next step in their quest to a 1st NBA title. To breakdown the Pacers and their title chances I brought in former NBA champion Quinn Buckner to talk about it. Quinn currently does color commentary for the Indiana Pacers on Fox Sports Indiana. Quinn’s 10 year career spanned stops in Boston, Milwaukee, and Indiana. I thank him and the Pacers organization for letting me have an opportunity to pick his brain on the NBA. Take a listen and enjoy this podcast.&lt;/span&gt;
