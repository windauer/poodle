&lt;p&gt;Putting the issue another way: Are you building you theology on rock or sand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW this and the previous video about Ezekiel&amp;#8217;s spacemen are a change of style. Since I started putting these podcasts on YouTube (as well as MP3 audio) I have been doing simple screencasts. In these I&amp;#8217;ve combined video with captions. What do you think of the change?&lt;/p&gt;

It is also longer and less fun than most, so if you like miss it out unless later in the series you need to come back to it for the framework&amp;#8230; The system suggested here is not intended to be completely scholarly and precise, far less exhaustive, rather it is meant to be simple and convenient, necessitating some approximations and simplifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_2638" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Capture.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-2638" alt="Classifying genres of anything is like drawing a tree" src="http://5minutebible.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Capture-300x181.jpg" width="300" height="181" hspace="20" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Classifying genres of anything is like drawing a tree&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;Two main genres&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be helpful to distinguish poems and songs. Not so much because songs imply music, but because they suggest a more communal context (often celebratory or liturgical). Poem, similarly suggests a more reflective mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Songs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will divide &amp;#8220;songs&amp;#8221; into three convenient groups: Psalms, Songs in narrative texts and Love Songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;Psalms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Songs addressed to or about God are mainly (but by no means exclusively) found in the book of Psalms. I&amp;#8217;ll divide them here into three genres plus a grab-bag categoy for the other sorts (which each only have a few examples). Psalms of these genres are found also outside the book of psalms (e.g. in prophetic books, or embedded in narrative&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/genres-of-poetry-in-scripture/#footnote_0_2637" id="identifier_0_2637" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" See below. "&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Laments/Complaints&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalms that focus on a sense that something is wrong have a fairly standard form&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/genres-of-poetry-in-scripture/#footnote_1_2637" id="identifier_1_2637" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about this more when we focus on the genre. A &amp;ldquo;form&amp;rdquo;, in this context, implies a more or less regular pattern of organisation and contents. Though the relative focus on&amp;nbsp; different elements may vary, and some may sometimes be missing. "&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but some focus more on a statement of the wrong (laments), while others seem more determined to hold God responsible (complaints) while a third group recognise that the speaker is themself responsible for the wrongness (confessions).&#160;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/genres-of-poetry-in-scripture/#footnote_2_2637" id="identifier_2_2637" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" For more on this see my chapter: Tim Bulkeley, &amp;ldquo;Does Jeremiah Confess, Lament, or Complain? Three Attitudes Towards Wrong.&amp;rdquo; In Spiritual Complaint: Theology and Practice of Lament, edited by Miriam J. Bier and Tim Bulkeley, 5&amp;ndash;17. Eugene, OR: Pickwick, 2013. "&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because the world is such a mess such psalms are more common than the other genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Hymns&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not old multi-verse&#160; worship songs, but psalms that focus on praising God. They have a standard form: &lt;strong&gt;Call to praise&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;#8220;Let us&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;) or declaration of intent to praise (I will&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;) linked by a &lt;strong&gt;conjunction&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;#8220;for&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;because&amp;#8221;) to the &lt;strong&gt;reasons for praise&lt;/strong&gt;. (There is sometimes a conclusion also.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Thanksgivings&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are psalms that focus on giving thanks to God for the good things he supplies and does. Their form has some typical components, but is less regular than the hymns. Elements of thanksgiving (like praise or lament etc.) may be found in psalms of other genres, they are a regular part of complaints (recognising the psalmists&amp;#8217; conviction that God will put things right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Assorted&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This grab-bag for all the rest includes psalms classified according to their subject matter: wisdom psalms, royal psalms, Zion psalms, and other small groups with few examples each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;Love songs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book Song of Songs (Song of Solomon) is a collection of love songs, there is also a parody love song in Isaiah 5.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/genres-of-poetry-in-scripture/#footnote_3_2637" id="identifier_3_2637" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" See below on how prophets often deform genres for rhetorical purposes. "&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;Song in Narrative texts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways song is incorporated into (prose) narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&#160;Singing the story&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a prose account of the events we sometimes find a song about the same events e.g.: Ex 15 (following Ex 14);&#160; Judges 5 (following Judges 4)&amp;#8230;&#160; these do not so much retell the story as celebrate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Singing in the story&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also find characters in the story singing songs, or fragments of song,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/genres-of-poetry-in-scripture/#footnote_4_2637" id="identifier_4_2637" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title=" Nb. the examples above could be considered this way, but are longer and less integrated into the telling, which I think suggests we may consider them somewhat differently for these purposes. "&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Poems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are found in two main places, prophets and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;Prophets used poetry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophets often adopt and use genres that we would expect to find elsewhere, e.g. they take dirges (often called laments, risking confusion with lament/complaint psalms) and sing them over living people or communities.&#160; In doing this they &amp;#8220;deform&amp;#8221; the genre and give it new and different rhetorical force. Such variation and ingenuity adds spice to prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;Wisdom Poems and sayings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biblical wisdom is most often expressed in poetry. &lt;strong&gt;Proverbs&lt;/strong&gt; are short poetic sayings. The book of Proverbs also contains longer &lt;strong&gt;reflective poems&lt;/strong&gt; (Proverbs 1-9) and the speeches in the drama of Job are fine poetry used to explore ideas, as in a different way does Ecclesiastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blessings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings are expressed in poetry and fall outside the classification proposed so far (except that they are embedded in narrative).&lt;/p&gt;

A &amp;#8220;form&amp;#8221;, in this context, implies a more or less regular pattern of organisation and contents.

                    <itunes:summary>This podcast may benefit from a set of notes, either as an alternative to the audio/screencast or as a reminder (since has a high information content). It is also longer and less fun than most, so if you like miss it out unless later in the series you need to come back to it for the framework… The system suggested here is not intended to be completely scholarly and precise, far less exhaustive, rather it is meant to be simple and convenient, necessitating some approximations and simplifications.
Classifying genres of anything is like drawing a tree
Two main genres
It can be helpful to distinguish poems and songs. Not so much because songs imply music, but because they suggest a more communal context (often celebratory or liturgical). Poem, similarly suggests a more reflective mode.
Songs
We will divide “songs” into three convenient groups: Psalms, Songs in narrative texts and Love Songs.
Psalms
Songs addressed to or about God are mainly (but by no means exclusively) found in the book of Psalms. I’ll divide them here into three genres plus a grab-bag categoy for the other sorts (which each only have a few examples). Psalms of these genres are found also outside the book of psalms (e.g. in prophetic books, or embedded in narrative1
Laments/Complaints
Psalms that focus on a sense that something is wrong have a fairly standard form2 but some focus more on a statement of the wrong (laments), while others seem more determined to hold God responsible (complaints) while a third group recognise that the speaker is themself responsible for the wrongness (confessions).&#160;3 Because the world is such a mess such psalms are more common than the other genres.
Hymns
Not old multi-verse&#160; worship songs, but psalms that focus on praising God. They have a standard form: Call to praise (“Let us…”) or declaration of intent to praise (I will…”) linked by a conjunction (“for” or “because”) to the reasons for praise. (There is sometimes a conclusion also.)
Thanksgivings
Are psalms that focus on giving thanks to God for the good things he supplies and does. Their form has some typical components, but is less regular than the hymns. Elements of thanksgiving (like praise or lament etc.) may be found in psalms of other genres, they are a regular part of complaints (recognising the psalmists’ conviction that God will put things right).
Assorted
This grab-bag for all the rest includes psalms classified according to their subject matter: wisdom psalms, royal psalms, Zion psalms, and other small groups with few examples each.
Love songs
The book Song of Songs (Song of Solomon) is a collection of love songs, there is also a parody love song in Isaiah 5.4
Song in Narrative texts
There are two main ways song is incorporated into (prose) narrative.
&#160;Singing the story
Following a prose account of the events we sometimes find a song about the same events e.g.: Ex 15 (following Ex 14);&#160; Judges 5 (following Judges 4)…&#160; these do not so much retell the story as celebrate it.
Singing in the story
We also find characters in the story singing songs, or fragments of song,5
Poems
Are found in two main places, prophets and wisdom.
Prophets used poetry
Prophets often adopt and use genres that we would expect to find elsewhere, e.g. they take dirges (often called laments, risking confusion with lament/complaint psalms) and sing them over living people or communities.&#160; In doing this they “deform” the genre and give it new and different rhetorical force. Such variation and ingenuity adds spice to prophecy.
Wisdom Poems and sayings
Biblical wisdom is most often expressed in poetry. Proverbs are short poetic sayings. The book of Proverbs also contains longer reflective poems (Proverbs 1-9) and the speeches in the drama of Job are fine poetry used to explore ideas, as in a different way does Ecclesiastes.
Blessings
Blessings are expressed in poetry and fall outside the classific[...]</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;The first word is &lt;em&gt;hesed&lt;/em&gt; a key virtue in the Bible and one ascribed typically to God. That is both it typifies God&amp;#8217;s relatiuonship with us, and God shows us what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>Here’s the first of a new series of podcasts on words that pose particular difficulty because English either lacks clearly similar concepts, or the word carries quite different connotations (emotional overtones and other baggage) from the word that denotes (points to) a similar thing.
The first word is hesed a key virtue in the Bible and one ascribed typically to God. That is both it typifies God’s relatiuonship with us, and God shows us what it means.</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;In our student exegesis assignments we ask them to state the intended meaning for the ancient hearers, ideally in one sentence, maybe two, never more than 50 words. They commonly have two problems. The first is being brief &lt;img src="http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /&gt;  I have a Sansblogue post on &lt;a href="http://bigbible.org/sansblogue/digital-life/blog/write-tight/"&gt;writing tightly&lt;/a&gt; that helps address this issue. Their second problem is that they often tend to forget that the text ever had ancient hearers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the Bible is a record of communicative acts, and communicative acts are always contextual. Some &amp;#8220;holy books&amp;#8221; (like the Qur&amp;#8217;an?) are believed to be timeless and decontextual, some (like the I Ching) are thought of as magical or quasi-magical, but the Bible is &amp;#8220;just&amp;#8221; a complex communicative act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very complex one, according to Christians, since it involves the Holy Spirit communicating with people in all sorts of times and places, through human acts of communication at particular times and places. That&amp;#8217;s what some hermeneuts&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/what-did-the-text-mean/#footnote_0_968" id="identifier_0_968" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="If the art and science of understanding is hermeneutics, then the person who does it is presumably a hermeneut. "&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; call the double agency of Scripture. But doubly agented texts are not unusual &amp;#8211; all messages (except written or electronic ones) have double agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is the notion that an Old Testament text was addressed to ancient Israelites, and/or ancient Judaites or Jews, before it was addressed to modern Christians so difficult?&lt;/p&gt;

The first is being brief   I have a Sansblogue post on writing tightly that helps address this issue. Their second problem is that they often tend to forget that the text ever had ancient hearers!
Yet the Bible is a record of communicative acts, and communicative acts are always contextual. Some “holy books” (like the Qur’an?) are believed to be timeless and decontextual, some (like the I Ching) are thought of as magical or quasi-magical, but the Bible is “just” a complex communicative act.
It’s a very complex one, according to Christians, since it involves the Holy Spirit communicating with people in all sorts of times and places, through human acts of communication at particular times and places. That’s what some hermeneuts1 call the double agency of Scripture. But doubly agented texts are not unusual – all messages (except written or electronic ones) have double agency.
So why is the notion that an Old Testament text was addressed to ancient Israelites, and/or ancient Judaites or Jews, before it was addressed to modern Christians so difficult?

In Jeremiah the passages known as “the confessions of Jeremiah” are particularly interesting. Here I’ll just look at one feature of the first two (or three, it depends how we count them   of these passages and notice how it helps us towards a possible understanding of the sudden change in Psalm 22 that we noticed in the last post in this series (Complaint Psalms: Part Two).

&lt;p&gt;Contradictions in Scripture are real guides to how we should read. In Proverbs they reminded us how proverbs work, and how we have to select when to apply which proverb. In other places they are often reminders of the humanity of Scripture, that we have the thoughts of particular authors, in particular times and places, who were inspired by God not the words of God taken down as dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Is 56:6-8 stands in contrast in its welcoming approach to foreigners to the harsher attitude of Ezra&amp;#8217;s prayer 9:5ff.&lt;br /&gt;
The debate between the two passages shows us Scripture as incarnate word, rooted in particular times and places, but then that is how the God of the Bible works: choosing the Jews, coming to earth in Jesus&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://podbible.com/files/E100/E100_Chapter_2.mp3"&gt;reading of Genesis 3&lt;/a&gt; is here. There is another take on this passage, talking about &lt;a href="http://5minutebible.com/theology/bonhoeffer-on-gen-3-conscience/"&gt;Bonhoeffer&amp;#8217;s paradoxical take on &amp;#8220;conscience&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; in an earlier podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking in pictures is necessary when we are talking about God. But all pictures are dangerous. Talking about a god who is Father but not Mother is not the Christian God, but Zeus or Baal. Christians who do it are making the same mistake many atheists make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are &amp;#8220;rough edges&amp;#8221; like this in a text it is a critic&amp;#8217;s job, any sort of critic worth their salt, to pick at them and hope to see more of how or why the text is constructed. That&amp;#8217;s what I do here, encourage you to pick at the edges from a narrative, relational perspective, and to ask so what&amp;#8217;s going on here when God ascribes it to Moses, the people to a fine new golden statue, and Moses says God dunnit?&lt;/p&gt;

When there are “rough edges” like this in a text it is a critic’s job, any sort of critic worth their salt, to pick at them and hope to see more of how or why the text is constructed. That’s what I do here, encourage you to pick at the edges from a narrative, relational perspective, and to ask so what’s going on here when God ascribes it to Moses, the people to a fine new golden statue, and Moses says God dunnit?

Aparently back in 2007 he issued a challenge that readers of his blog could not give examples of humour from every book in the Bible: &lt;a href="http://lingamish.com/2007/09/funny-stuff-in-the-bible/"&gt;Funny Stuff in the Bible&lt;/a&gt;. Now of course his 2007 post was cheating. He set a (nearly?) impossible task, to find humour in Lamentations might be hard! But that does not mean that there is no humour in Scripture. Just think of one of the occasions when Jesus spoke about camels (he seems to me to have had a thing about camels). Or, for crying out loud, read Jonah aloud in any translation or language you like, and try keeping a straight face…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would take up David’s challenge. Not seriously, as I said I expect there are some books devoid of humour, it takes all sorts to make up God’s world, even the humourless! But I do plan to work through the Bible (or at the very least the Hebrew Bible) pointing out humour in most of the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the evidence and try to answer her speculation. This evidence comes mainly from surrounding peoples, though the Bible has some contribution to make, so this podcast can squeak into a series called 5 Minute Bible &lt;img src="http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of ancient Israel’s neighbours had pantheons which included prominent goddesses alongside gods. In Egypt Isis was particularly important, while in Mesopotamia the gate named after Ishtar was a hugely impressive archaeological feature. In Ugarit, Anat the sister and wife of Ba’al had an important role to play in restoring the king of the gods to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could Israel have benefitted from a female companion for Yahweh?&lt;/p&gt;

This direct speech is often skillfully crafted to give a lively and rich portrayal of the person. The podcast begins with cases where a group of people speak (we already heard one of these in the post &lt;a title="external link" href="http://5minutebible.com/humour-in-the-bible-part-2-still-introducing-saul/"&gt;Humour in the Bible: Part 2: Still Introducing Saul&lt;/a&gt;). Another example of this is found in Jonah 1:8 though here different emotions are expressed. The book of Ruth uses skillfully differentiated speech to help portray the characters. In this podcast we&amp;#8217;ll look at Boaz&amp;#8217; two speeches to Ruth from chapter 2 (Ruth 2:11-12; 8-9).&lt;/p&gt;

Yet there are for sure some difficult passages. There are also passages that seem to flat out contradict other parts of the Bible. How can you call a book like that &amp;#8220;perspicuous&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;#8217;ll argue that one key mistake we make is to think of the Bible as if all its parts were also &amp;#8220;Bible&amp;#8221;, they aren&amp;#8217;t they are merely fragments!&lt;/p&gt;

In this post I’ll argue that one key mistake we make is to think of the Bible as if all its parts were also “Bible”, they aren’t they are merely fragments!

&lt;p&gt;In addressing this question, as well as a look at how this passage fits into Peter&amp;#8217;s argument we&amp;#8217;ll need to notice how modern translators often have to interpret, and sometimes add to Scripture (perhaps distorting it&amp;#8217;s message).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally my new Facebook friend&#160;Margaret Mowczko has a fine post on the topic here &lt;a href="http://newlife.id.au/equality-and-gender-issues/submission-in-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow"&gt;http://newlife.id.au/equality-and-gender-issues/submission-in-marriage/&lt;/a&gt;&#160;if you want to read as well as hear &lt;img src="http://5minutebible.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the Bible story, at the start of the second part of the library of Scripture, we hear the story of Jesus and his teaching, his death and resurrection. This is prolonged into the beginning of the story of the new humanity and illustrated by various letters before the big story ends in terror and destruction leading to a new heaven and earth.&lt;/p&gt;

So, how does one find one’s way around and use such a weird book? This podcast explains “chapters” and “verses”, how to find “books”, and gives the chief key to making some sort of sense of the widely and wildly different contents of The Holy Bible.

Perhaps no Bible text illustrates the dangers of a simplistic reading of Scripture than 1 Cor 14:34.
If we tear this verse from its cotext,1 and then read it as if the Bible were “God’s instruction manual for life” and even worse read it also literally then we are in trouble! The verse (in the fairly literal NET)2 reads:
the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. Rather, let them be in submission, as in fact the law says.
The verse is full of oddities.3 Not the least of which is that in 1 Cor 11:4-6 Paul assumes that both women and men will pray and prophesy, and in this same chapter 1 Cor 14:4-5 suggests the same thing, and that this is indeed in the public meeting (cf. v.4). Paul seems to be contradicting himself!
What is going on, and how should we interpret such passages?
&#160;
 Or for a podcast.  Even the NRSV is less literal here omiting the “the” before women, one of the oddities of this verse is that Paul seems to be talking about some particular women.

                    <description>There certainly should certainly be humour in Proverbs, after all the books says: A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person&amp;#8217;s strength.

&lt;p&gt;There certainly should certainly be humour in Proverbs, after all the books says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person&amp;#8217;s strength. (Proverbs 17:22)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure enough when I went humour-hunting Google quickly fitted me up with Hershey H. Friedman, he used to be Bernard H. Stern Professor of Humor so you know he&amp;#8217;s a serious humour scholar, and he wrote on “Humor in the Bible” with lots of examples from Proverbs. The article is in the journal &lt;em&gt;Humor: International Journal of Humor Research&lt;/em&gt;, (Vol. 13:3, Sept. 2000, 258-285) so again we know this is pukka academic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is what Hershey found funny, often left me un-moved, and worse he seemed to have an affinity for nagging wife jokes, and Barbara is no nag! But he did prompt me to look at Proverbs 26 (lots of his examples came from there) and boy is that right, as you&amp;#8217;ll see nearly every line is funny. I only get up to verse 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the humour does sometimes raise questions, like those Randal raised about &lt;a href="http://randalrauser.com/2011/06/on-slurring-cretans-and-indians/"&gt;ethnic sterotyping in Paul&amp;#8217;s comments about Cretans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Ker, in &lt;a href="http://lingamish.com/2011/04/its-time-to-cut-the-cheese/"&gt;one of the posts that stimulated this series&lt;/a&gt;, poses the serious and significant question: given the cultural gulf that separates us from the authors of Scripture how can we be sure something we see as funny tickled ancient Hebrew funny bones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotting humour is easier in speech than writing, and spotting humour is difficult across cultures. Anyone who has worked in a different culture knows how people&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;sense of humour&amp;#8221; is to a considerable extent culturally determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a whole academic discipline studying such questions, and several biblical scholars have put these studies to work. For we have such a cross-cultural written case everytime we think something in Scripture is funny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his paper F. Scott Spencer “Those Riotous &amp;#8211; Yet Righteous &amp;#8211; Foremothers of Jesus: Exploring Matthew’s Comic Genealogy.” In &lt;em&gt;Are we amused?: humour about women in the biblical worlds&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Athalya Brenner, 7-30. Continuum, 2003, lists some attempts to approach such questions and arrives at a list of clues that humour is present. I have modified his list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incongruity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lighthearted mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ingenuity (cleverness is often a mark of humour think of puns)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inferiority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disguise or something or someone pretending to be something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“inelasticity” (following Bergson)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;human pretension revealed in all its lack of glory!&lt;/li&gt;

Spotting humour is easier in speech than writing, and spotting humour is difficult across cultures. Anyone who has worked in a different culture knows how people’s “sense of humour” is to a considerable extent culturally determined.
There’s a whole academic discipline studying such questions, and several biblical scholars have put these studies to work. For we have such a cross-cultural written case everytime we think something in Scripture is funny!
In his paper F. Scott Spencer “Those Riotous – Yet Righteous – Foremothers of Jesus: Exploring Matthew’s Comic Genealogy.” In Are we amused?: humour about women in the biblical worlds, edited by Athalya Brenner, 7-30. Continuum, 2003, lists some attempts to approach such questions and arrives at a list of clues that humour is present. I have modified his list:

incongruity
lighthearted mood
surprise
ingenuity (cleverness is often a mark of humour think of puns)
inferiority
disguise or something or someone pretending to be something else
“inelasticity” (following Bergson)
human pretension revealed in all its lack of glory!

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Malachi is a short prophetic book, the name Malachi just means &amp;#8220;my messenger&amp;#8221; which seems to be what the speaker calls himself. It has no more details of time, place or person in the superscription (as most prophetic books do), but the content suggests Judah after the exile under Persian rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book opens opens with a strong statement of Yahweh&amp;#8217;s election of Israel, using hyperbole (exaggeration) to make it&amp;#8217;s impact. &amp;#8220;Malachi&amp;#8221; accuses his audience of being willing to obey and seek to please humans but not God! He calls for proper sacrifice cf. pre-exilic prophets who were less impressed by sacrifice. The book usually signals when others words are being imagined, making it easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It addresses priests much of the time and the greater importance of priests, sacrifice and law/torah is a feature that suggests the time when Israel was province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malachi&amp;#8217;s mix of concern for the here and now and for the future is typical of prophetic books, but this book is more weighted to future than most. More than any other short prophetic book Malachi prepares for and links to the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
