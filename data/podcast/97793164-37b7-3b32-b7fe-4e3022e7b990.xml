Rich dives into the strange world of Kentucky Route Zero and we discuss episodic gaming, in general. Steve talks about a few soundtracks he’s been listening to; namely, Limbo, Dear Ester, and Fez.

Matt was away all weekend so he took an off topic rant from the previous episode and chucked it against the wall of the internet. 
It turned from a discussion of Steve’s latest piece on Medium into a conversation about game innovation, crowd sourcing consoles, companies that are taking chances, and the design philosophy of David Cage, head designer of Quantum Dream.
No music this time around, just rants. We will be back to our shenanigans next week!

Rich kicks off the episode in the bath of the Summer Steam Sale. He talks about retro platformer Oniken and noir-styled puzzle platformer Gunpoint. Matt finally beats The Last of Us and takes a moment to reflect on the feelings and mature writing of Naughty Dog. Spoiler free, promise. Matt then takes us into the world of printed text (what?) as he describes his latest book purchase Super Mario Bros. 3: Brick by Brick – a combination personal essay and psuedo-strategy guide by Bob Chipman. Steve then, on the heels of his latest piece about E3, Los Angeles and the industry, describes game journalist burnout and why he’s taking a break. From games, not the podcast… we still love him.
Featuring music from the classic chip album Information Chase by Bit Shifter.

Canada’s game industry contributed 2.3 billion dollars to the country’s GDP, according to ESA Canada. Some of the best games of last year came out of Canada. The strongest development communities call cities in Canada their home. These are not insignifigant elements to making a stronger world-wide game industry.
We invite real-life Canadian and creator of Retro City Rampage, Brian Provinciano, on to the show to talk about indie development communities, solid game studios, and the Full Indie Summit. We also talk about how major game studios are positioning themselves in Canada and how it’s helping/hurting.
Brian also regales us with the tales of his nightmarish distrobution schedule and organization across platforms and regions. Important information for anyone looking to publish their game themselves.
Featuring music from Kris Keyser’s self titled album.

We’re playin’ them up and spitting them out. 
Steve takes us to a god-forsaken post-apocalyptic hell hole when he talks about the game The Last of Us. Spoiler free so don’t be afraid to listen if you haven’t played yet. Rich picks 2 of the smattering of games he’s played. First off is the new Mortal Kombat in which he talks about how he was pleasantly surprised about how tight the story is for a fighting game. He also brings up Neir, a genre bending fantasy. Lastly, Matt gets his Rogue-like on with the game Rogue Legacy. A game where your kids take your place in the battle, and nobody is perfect.
Featuring music from Tonight We Launch.

Red Dead Redemption is Rockstar Game’s love letter to the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and American tales of Robert Ford framed as their signature open world. This episode I am joined by Tayo from the Dangerous Kids podcast to take this game piece by piece and analyse what we love and hate about one of our favorite games. From the beautiful scenery, to the nutjob characters, to the surprisingly engaging story, there is a lot of love about saddling a horse and taking a ride through this unique world. This may go without saying but: spoilers abound!

The new A Jumps B Shoots studio is up! Sorry about how long this took. We recorded an episode about the new console generation before E3. Our intention was to release our thoughts both pre and post E3 however, the move of the studio proved to be quite an undertaking (it included the rest of my belongings as well). However, this episode still represents our thoughts about the upcoming generation of consoles. Let us know what you think!
Update: Microsoft has dropped their DRM and 24 hour internet check in! Maybe they are listening.

                    <itunes:summary>We’re back! Infinite apologies for the lapse in episodes. Let’s get back on this horse.
Steve pushes our feelings of a disappointing AAA year with the poor showing of Star Trek and an especially discouraging moment with the game Soul Sacrifice. You expect great things when the creator of Mega Man takes on a project that sounds like a current-gen version of Planescape Torment. Alas, this is where we are in games.
Rich brings another one of the long developed, highly anticipated games to the fold, Monaco. Bringing a Ocean’s Eleven team-heist game with a Pacman meets the Atari 2600 visuals, the game is a masterful multiplayer experience. He also falls for a web series that shows itself to be a wonderful supplement to our podcast, Extra Credits. 
Finally, Matt finds meaningful narrative in an albeit simplistic puzzle platformer in Thomas was Alone. He also stumbles over a bizarre web based text game called CAndy Box that must be played before you learn anything about it. 
Featuring music from Cheapshot’s album ZOMG!.

Death can either mean everything or nothing in a game. It can be the central obstacle to overcome or a minor inconvenience in a grand adventure. Whatever it means, it’s influence on how we approach and play games is undeniable. 
We invite Stu Horvath, editor in chief of Unwinnable, to talk about this macabre mechanic. We talk about games that don’t make death a huge ordeal like Fez and the Lego games. How their focus on exploration and chance taking defines their place in games. We then move on to death teaching us the game, rogue-likes, retro games, and the rise of “hardcore” play-throughs.
We survived this episode, you can too!

On this episode Rich and Matt dive into their fondness for downloadable local multiplayer games with Behemoth’s follow up to Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theater, and the beautifully designed metriodvania tale of a luchador out for revenge, Guacamelee.
Steve changes the pace with what can be considered Twin Peaks – the game, Deadly Premonition. We dive into how unsettling, funny, strange, immersive, and brilliant the game can be. If it’s not the terrifying survival horror moments, it’s the fact that you need to take your clothes to the cleaners in game. Play this. We implore you.
Featuring music from Euan Lynn.

It’s a Tomb Raider extravaganza!
Well, except for Rich, who brings a game called SpaceChem to our attention. A slick little puzzle game that seriously challenges our ability to think ahead and split the basic molecules that make up our living world… FOR SCIENCE!
Matt talks about the new Tomb Raider reboot and the serious issues of cognitive dissonance and severely immersion breaking habits of unrealistic scenario vs moments of protagonist doubt and introspection of violence. Aside from that he also argues that it’s a fun game. Just don’t try to take it too seriously.
Steve plays a Tomb Raider of a different stripe, Tomb Raider Anniversary, from the newly released Trilogy. There is plenty to compare between the remake of the original and the reboot that attempts to add drama to the origin story of the iconic Laura Croft.
Featuring tracks from the&#160;Noise Channel Radio Compilation.

Our buddy Roo, host of 16-bit Gems and Way Games Work, joins us to explore a 16-bit universe. The 16-bit aesthetic has persisted well past it’s console era. The style has shown up in countless console games, the music is still ringing through tv speakers, and remakes of Super Nintendo era games are still big sellers. Why is this? What makes this style so acclimated to game development and does it still have a place in current game development?
This conversation morphs into a comparison between 16-bit RPG’s, early PS1 era RPG’s, and western developed RPG’s. Was there a heyday of RPG gaming or did each era bring their own unique flavor to the genre? How has Final Fantasy faired over the years and do the 16-bit versions overshadow the later and technically more impressive versions?
Featuring tracks from&#160;4Mat.

With PAX East and GDC butting up right against each other, coming across a guest was just about impossible. Even the triumphant return of Steve Haske had to call in from GDC. To solve this, we decided to pick some things to talk about that wouldn’t make an entire episode.
Steve talks about what he is anticipating at GDC. He is planning an interview with Suda 51 about his new game, Killer is Dead. As well as Keiji Inafune about his new Ninja Gaiden spin off, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z. CD Project Red is in line for the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. 
Rich is a big fan of board games, including the impenetrably long and complicated ones. One such game is a 3+ hour adventure in economics called  Age of Steam. He talks about a different type of power fantasy, the struggle of social and economic position. A game element not commonly explored by folks who are worried about the possible influence on people.
Finally, Matt is SO excited about the new Ducktales remake! He also talks about how the confluence of marketing, preorders, and embargos have created a unique and consumer-unfriendly economy. An economy that, unfortunately, gamers and fans have been enthusiastically supporting. With the latest Sim City controversy, it seems gamers and journalists are seeing firsthand the destructive nature of an uninformed customer base.
Featuring tracks from&#160;Bud Melvin.
Correction: Matt seems to have a tendency to create game studios in his head. The Ducktales game was indeed entirely developed by Capcom.

With Steve’s absence from the show Rich and Matt plow through a 2-man whatcha playin’ pow-wow. 
Rich starts the episode with his adventures down the hills with the latest SSX title. We then discuss the limited replay-ability of racing games and the pitfalls that can make a great racing game a very short-lived experience. Also, how awesome Dirt is.
He then abruptly moves on to Persona 3 FES, a game that has spent some time on Rich’s digital shelf. Long, strange, fun, and very Japanese.
Matt just started playing the grindy, tough as nails JRPG Etrian Odyssey. He finds it enjoyable but a very hard game to recommend outside of the very hardcore gaming contingent.
Matt is also, as many loyal listeners know, a big fan of Far Cry 2. His journey into the third iteration of the franchise is not without some skepticism. As much as he enjoyed the echoes of the pervious game he can’t help but think there were some major missed opportunities as far as the story is concerned. How about more of a fish-out-of-water storyline? Can our actions impact the world more than it did in the sequel? How about a likable main protagonist? At least he got to kill a bear.
Featuring tracks from the&#160;Hotline Miami Soundtrack.

Laws in the United States have famously been lagging behind the break neck speed of video game technology. For a long time we’ve had our white knight represent us in court cases and with patent law, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
We invite Richard Esguerra, Director of Development for the EFF, to help us navigate this web of end user agreements, DRM, patent law, and the issue of ownership on digital downloads. The landscape of law surrounding video games are still in their formative years. There are still a lot of purposed ideas for how to legislate ownership and distribution, but nothing really concrete. This is where the EFF comes in to make sure the rights of the user are upheld.
I highly recommend, if you have the means, to donate to the EFF, become a member, or volunteer.

Michael Abbott, also known as the Featuring tracks by&#160;Brainy Gamer, has a unique voice in games journalism. For this episode, he adds a perspective about game violence straight from the pages of the Brainy Gamer blog. Our conversation tackles several facets of the issue to provide a broader understanding. This will help us communicate with non-gamers who misconceive of what games are and could be.
Understanding the issue on the other side is key to creating a meaningful dialog over something that can instill fear stemming from a misunderstanding of the medium. We outline the importance of understanding the perspective of the other end of the issue. That perhaps marketing of games could be setting our argument back a bit. That we need to rise above the current conception being built around us.
Michael suggests that we could build a campaign of sharing our stories. We all have our own stories in our lives about video games. This can be an effective tool of evangelism for games and the role they can play in our lives, violent or not. Even going as far as “diagnosing” someone and matching them with their perfect game just to give them a taste of the joy that perfect game can bring.
This frames the conversation and levels the playing field. It makes inflammatory comments made by politicians, lobbyists, and talking heads sound even more ridiculous. It seems far fetched, but possible. 
We end the show talking about how much we enjoy Telltale Game’s The Walking Dead, and how it can be a prime example of everything we discussed earlier in the episode.

This week’s Whatcha Playin’ contains a special guest: AJBS’ very own social media manager, Jarrett Civelli. Jarrett makes it a point to talk about Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, the beautiful JRPG mashup between&#160;Dragon Quest’s Level-5 and Studio Ghibli, the animation studio of anime legend Hayao Miyazaki. What makes Ni No Kuni so great? According to Jarrett, the PS3-exclusive is the perfect blend of old-school genre feel modernized by sensible mechanics—not to mention the sweeping aesthetics, soundtrack and Ghibli-quality storyline. Well worth your time.
Steve takes on Platinum’s&#160;Anarchy Reigns, the budgetish pseudo-sequel to Madworld. There are similarities between the two, namely the comically brutal violence and chainsaw-for-an-arm protagonist Jack, but where Anarchy earns its stripes is through its bonkers multiplayer, which had Steve actually playing online (a rarity).
While it’s debatable whether or not Ron Gilbert’s new downloadable The Cave can be interpreted as an adaptation of Plato’s allegory, Rich’s reservations with it are pretty clear. For such a cool concept (seven inherently awful people are each granted whatever they most want in the world), Double Fine allowed some pretty puzzling math to slip through, though the game is at least worth a peek.
Finally Matt talks about Antichamber, a mind-bending puzzle game that can only be described as two staircases that, when taken, lead you back around to place where you started.

There is a conversation in America about violence in videogames. While the cool-headed and rational among us don’t believe this medium signals the end times, the debate—or blame—rages on. And the points of either side rarely change. Yet the treatment of violence in games can be a constructive thing. It can emulate the sense of chaos and horror and confusion the average person would experience in a real life firefight, as Kane &amp; Lynch 2 does.
The particulars or gravity of the situation may shift, but violence is also an inevitable part of any survival scenario. How far would you go to stay alive in, say, Fallout 3′s post-apocalyptic wasteland? Would you let your moral compass guide you? Or murder a stranger just because you want his cool hat?
Perhaps, as is so often the case, you’re the archetypal hero. One minute you’re riddling enemies with bullets— one cannon fodder target after the next in endless ways—then the story turns in on itself, forcing you, the player, to question who exactly you really are and what the consequences of your actions might be. Games &#160;like&#160;Spec Ops: The Line, Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry 2 and The Walking Dead make it impossible to separate violence from narrative, either forcing you along an unsure path or to shaping your experience, however unwillingly, into a personal psychological profile.
Let’s talk about violence. All of it.

This week’s Whatcha Playin’ features a newly rebooted IP, an intense iOS game and some retro multiplayer madness:
Rich dives into VVVVVV creator Terry Cavanagh‘s&#160;Super Hexagon with all its fast-paced intensity—Cavanagh has clearly not lost his touch for smart game design, nor his joy for ramped up difficulty.
Matt continues his call for gamers to dust off their old consoles for multiplayer fun with friends, highlighting the NES classics&#160;Dodgeball and Marble Madness.&#160;Many retro games have shown their age through incredibly frustrating or cheap difficulty (ahem,&#160;Ninja Gaiden), but these aforementioned two prove, as AJBS recently did with friends 2 Player Productions, that game nights can be a great way to rediscover that old school charm.
Finally, AJBS bids a sad farewell to Steve’s backwards-compatible 80gb PS3; four years and three average gaming lifetimes after the old friends met,&#160;it finally succumbed to the yellow light of hardware failure, replacing the green light that shepherded hundreds of hours of great (and some not-so-great) gaming memories. At least the denouement involved&#160;DmC, the smart and aesthetically dynamic reintroduction to Dante and his effortlessly cool demon-hunting lifestyle.

Stealth design is more prevalent than it used to be—even more typical action titles seem to have at least a level devoted to hiding in the shadows. Where then does that leave a core stealth experience? How can it stand out from the crowd?
Klei’s&#160;Mark of the Ninja&#160;tweaks that paradigm by throwing it into only two dimensions. Speaking with creative lead&#160;Nels Anderson, AJBS discusses how the design of this indie hit works in 2D through visualizations of sound, precision movement et al, as well as Nels’ own influences and the philosophy of sneaking in general.
Switching gears, there is also some conversation over the difference between a game that’s “fun” versus one that’s “engaging”—naturally the conversation steers towards&#160;Dark Souls, and, interestingly,&#160;Megaman X. Enjoy!

Our first Whatcha Playin’ of the new year brings a few games back from our past, for better or worse.
Matt sings the praises—and laments the maddening qualities—of the old-school&#160;Heroes of Might and Magic 3&#160;and&#160;Ultima 8: Pagan, discussing his experiences with each series’ respectively addictive and arcane qualities (via Good Old Games).
Steve talks about two games from one of his favorite designers, Yasumi Matsuno. First is the wonderfully Shakespearean&#160;Vagrant Story:&#160;arguably Square’s other classic dark fantasy tale for the PS One (astride Final Fantasy Tactics) for its unique battle system alone. It’s also aged well. There’s also some mention&#160;Crimson Shroud, Matsuno’s latest for the 3DS, notable for being essentially an interactive D&amp;D game, complete with character figurines that wobble on-screen.
Rich also introduces a hilariously fun iOS game, Spaceteam. It’s a game of&#160;teamwork; players have to work together on a multiscreen control panel that ends in spouting nonsense phrases at each other. There’s a&#160;short recording of it being played during this episode’s post roll. It’s…interesting.

The game Earthbound means a lot of things to a lot of people. It’s a defining moment in games history, even if most people have never played it. It stands as one of the absolute best 16-bit RPG’s up there with Final Fantasy 6, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, and Phantasy Star 4, yet has never seen an updated release.
The game, however, has driven our guest, Jon Kay, to design some of the most stunning game based designs out there. Subtle, inconspicuous, and almost invites you into a secret club when you can decipher the puzzle of the shirts he designs. We talk about his beginnings with the site Starmen.net and its eventual evolution into the influential on-line retail store Fangamer.
He explains the origins of the sites, his approach to his exquisitely unique designs, how he joined a charge to get Earthbound and Mother 3 released in the United States, and what the game really, truly means to him. His description of the game really challenges one to rethink how games can effect us and influence our lives.

This week it’s all games—Steve plays the first part of&#160;Assassin’s Creed III‘s audacious six hour intro and talks&#160;about its place in the series timeline and mythology, morphing into a conversation about the keen eye for historical accuracy Ubisoft’s design team has, then further evolving into an appreciation of some of the smart and comparatively subversive work the triple-A publisher has been putting out over the past few years (including our love of&#160;Far Cry 2, Outland&#160;and other Assassin’s Creed games, among others).
Matt talks word games—more specifically three that have held his interest on iOS recently. These run the gamut from&#160;the fast-paced puzzle elements of&#160;Puzzlejuice&#160;to&#160;the calmer gameplay of&#160;Spelltower&#160;and&#160;the multi-player aspects of&#160;Letterpress.
Rich finally finishes&#160;Resident Evil 4,&#160;explaining why it’s been added to his must-play list—the design, visuals and, yes, even the story are all top notch for a game that came out in 2004. Wonky controls be damned!

There are people in this world who aren’t comfortable the way they were born. Their attitudes and habits suggest that perhaps a woman can feel like a man, or visa versa. Transgendered people all over the world have lived through a lot. Torment, confusion, a staggeringly high suicide rate, and a society that would prefer to forget they exist. 
Gaming has offered a world that can accept anybody, even those who feel unacceptable. As our guest, Morgan McCormick of TransLabyrinth, states that game worlds are crazy and it can seem that a person changing gender is certainly not the strangest thing that can happen. Games can then provide a safe and fun place for not only play to happen but perhaps, a introspection on who that person is and jump into the shoes of someone a different gender than they are. It can be a tool of self discovery as well as a way to blow off some steam.
But game communities are not the most empathetic group in the world, nor do game publishers and developers seem to pay any mind to the existence of transgendered people. Their presence in the game world is minimal and it’s time to change that.

On a side note – A big thank you to everyone in the subreddits r/transgender and r/transgamers for helping me navigate this complex and sensitive issue.

Emily Jarrett decides that we aren’t too shabby a podcast and sticks around for a Whatcha Playin’. Emily conjurs up a conversation about completionism when she brings up the game Psychonauts. What is it about the gamer’s brain that drives us to search every corner to complete every single aspect of the game? SPOILER ALERT: We don’t provide answers, we just shout our question to the heavens. She also teaches us about the existance of two very interesting RPG board games – Discworld’s Ankh-Morpork and Fiasco. Rich challenges Steve’s opinion of Dishonored after exploring the detailed ins and outs of the game. Finally, Matt owns up to an Iphone game addiction brought on by Touch Arcade, Jetpack Joyride. Why do they have to put your friend’s scores on the top every time you open the game? He’s only 50 points ahead… I can do this. And so it begins…

Mythologies and religious stories can infuse a sense of familiarity and structure to a game’s narrative or moral discussion mechanic. It can inspire great things from a player or offer a sense of introspection. Matt and Rich are atheists. Their insight on this topic can be limited. To remedy this we invited Emily Jarrett, grad student of Divinity and host of PAX Prime’s God and Gaming panel, to offer a religious perspective on gaming.
We chat about these themes in Bioware games, Bastion, Journey, and El Shaddai.
Does religious inspiration in a game make it more inspiring? Does it add weight to moral choice? Why do we not see a lot of current western beliefs represented in games? Are the more tenants of ritual, pilgrimage, and sacrifice important to how we relate or react to games? One thing we know for certain, as Emily says, we can’t lose our stories.

Help! We are being taken over by the Unlistenable podcast! Wait, this is pretty cool. Nevermind, we’re good.
We are joined by editor at large of Unwinnable and host of The Unlistenable Podcast, Chuck Moran. We talk about the upcoming Geek Flea, what goes into building it, what can be found there, and some of the stranger things that can be found at something like a Geek Flea.
We also let Chuck insert a bit of Unlistenable flavor with the segment “Do you Care?”. We learn a lot about eachother. Some things we like. Others we don’t… Enjoy!

For the past several years, The Portland Retro Gaming Expo (PRGE) has been growing and attracting retro gamers from all over the country. This year, it has taken a huge leap taking over an entire hall of the Oregon Convention Center and several presentation rooms. A Jumps B Shoots attended and met up with fellow ‘The Punk Effect‘ alum Roo from 16 bit Gems.
While at the PRGE, Matt interviewed Garry Kitchen- programmer of Keystone Kapers, Donkey Kong for the 2600 and co-programmer of A Boy and his Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia as well as David Crane- co-founder of Activision. Rich also makes his hosting debut when he talks with Roo from 16-Bit Gems about Plok, repro SNES carts, and how Roo goes about making his show.

For this episode we invite Gerritt Rosa from Fangamer to talk about the games we’ve been playing. Gerritt exposes his secret love of management systems with the games Faster than Light and Plague Inc. Rich strips away the peels of rotting flesh from his PS3 to reveal some pretty wonderful gaming experiences with Popo and Yo and talks about the silent multi-player aspect of Journey. Steve gets scared for the future of Resident Evil with it’s sixth installment. Finally, Matt digs into his pile of Steam shame and pulls out a gem of a tower defense game with Orcs Must Die.
Featuring music by&#160;Leeni&#160;from the album Headphones on your Heart EP.
As a side note, all of the proceeds from Leeni’s new EP will be going to the JED Foundation to support their Love is Louder campaign to support suicide prevention. This is a great cause and I urge my listeners to take part in this and buy a copy of the album. — Matt

Whether its the metal inspired chill spots in Brutal Legend, the Lungfish and Raz in Psychonauts, or concept art for the Double Fine Adventure, his unique take on visuals have set games apart.

This week we chat with the founder of Shred Veggie, Michael “Milk” Millikin. He has been maintaining his blog as a way to share both how to eat better while gaming, and how to game better while eating. We talk about the history of junk food and video games marketing, how companies are capitalizing on the dual addictions of food and experience points, and various ways and recipes to eat healthier and more conveniently during the short load screens of the latest game your playing.
We also talk about Chex Quest. Yeah, that happens.
Got anything you like to make for long haul gaming sessions? Milk is starting a community of folks who love to game and eat. Contact him here.

Rich talks about the magical plantlife of&#160;Botanicula and how it differs from the gunmetal grey land of Amanita’s previous game, Machinarium;&#160;Steve continues Jackie Estacado’s saga with&#160;The Darkness&#160;and moves on to the Darkness II&#160;(which is better?) and Matt gushes over some of his favorite puzzle games for the DS, Picross and Picross 3D. Does the third dimension add another level of engaging gameplay or horrible frustration? Spoiler alert: you won’t be able to put it down. Featuring music by&#160;I Fight Dragons

Frequently on AJBS, we have a unified opinion about most games. Half Life? Loved it. Dead Space? Yes please. Portal? Seconds.
Surprisingly, co-hosts Rich Lau and Steve Haske both exclaimed drastically differing views about Grasshopper Manufacture’s&#160;Lollipop Chainsaw.&#160;Hashing it out seemed like a good idea, so the boxing gloves were dusted off, &#160;pads were strapped on and sparring commenced.
Is Lollipop Chainsaw a fun romp in a bizarre zombie apocalypse or a cloying, sloppily designed disappointment with Suda 51 seemingly trying to impersonate himself? Let us know what you think.

So, we’re trying something a little different at A Jumps B Shoots HQ: For the next few (or several, or whatever) weeks the podcast’s format is going to be shortened and run weekly. What does that mean to you, our loyal listeners? It means more in-depth Whatcha Playin’ segments will get their own episodes, alternating weeks with our regular guest discussions on loftier game-related matters. &#160;That way we get more times to talk about the games we really like or don’t like, and no matter what week it is you’ll have something to listen to.
This week, Matt finally gets The Binding of Isaac and learns what he has been missing from Metal Gear Solid 2. Rich reveals his love of Planet Puzzle League&#160;(by way of Henry Hatsworth)&#160;and shares with us his favorite PSN minis game, Where is my Heart. Finally Steve throws back to 2008 with Banjo Kazooie – Nuts and Bolts and shows us all how a pro plays the new Steel Battalion for the Xbox 360.

E3 has been in slow decline in importance over the years. Companies have not been using it as the big reveal venue as they have in previous years. Instead its a catch up for every little detail they plan on releasing over the next year. Steve’s trip to E3 was that of a reporter.

Watchdogs
Lollipop Chainsaw
Star Trek
