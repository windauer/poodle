&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial, Verdana" size="2"&gt;This is our 30th episode! &#160;How about that? &#160;I cannot believe that we have hit 30 episodes in what was originally going to be a 10 episode run! &#160;So with that said, we are thrilled to bring you this really fun episode where we start our look at all things from that other studio that has made a string of hits including a movie about bugs! Everything has been leading up to this series thus far. &#160;Please enjoy the fruits of our labor here. &#160;I am most thankful for my co-hosts over the past 30 episodes. So with that said let’s get on with the show. &#160;On second thought, let’s not. &#160;Definitely not yet at least. &#160;Even we are excited about this episode; as we should be. I for one, simply cannot contain my excitement about how fun this episode was to record. &#160;Should always be like that to be honest. &#160;Add the fact that the guys were as well and you have a great show. &#160;Because of this, we cannot contain our excitement. Otherwise, it just would not be a fun show, which it is. &#160;Underneath everything though is our love for the subject matter and of course our listeners. They, as in you guys, are our lifeblood. &#160; Don’t think we have forgotten about you guys. &#160;Really. &#160;Each one of you guys can be described with one word. &#160;Awesome. &#160;Many a podcast has been ended because of a lack of listeners but not this one. &#160;With that said, let’s get on with the show. &#160;Or we can go on with this description. &#160;Rick has already continued with this madness once before, he can do it again. &#160;Kiss this show description goodbye. &#160;Start listening to the episode already! &#160;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>To all who come to this happy podcast, welcome. Rediscovering the Magic is your podcast. Here, geeks relive fond memories of the past...and here those with youthful minds may enjoy and laugh at the promise of poop jokes. Rediscovering the Magic is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created Disney, with the hope that it will be a source of joy and entertainment to all the world.In our 26th episode, we bring you our Disney Bucket List. Basically everything from Disney that we want to do before we kick the proverbial bucket. We run the gamut from reasonable to expensive to just simply insane. We also pay tribute to Disney Alumni Paul Walker from "Meet the Deedles" (!) and we also give some love to the Skippers from the Jungle Cruise. Thanks for listening and see you later this month when we review FROZEN!</itunes:summary>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Rediscovering the Magic, our ongoing series of Disney trivia, history, and poop jokes. &#160;We bring you our 18th episode where we continue our series on the films that combine live action and animation with one movie that is very obscure while the other one is not exactly available for purchase in the United States but is much beloved regardless. “So Dear to My Heart” is an obscure classic that displays the medium in a very sweet and fun movie. &#160;”Song of the South” could possibly be one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. &#160;Both star child actor Bobby Driscoll and both are worth your time….if you can find them. &#160;Enjoy and thanks for listening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONTEST ALERT! &#160;We need a Twitter feed name! &#160;Come up with one and e-mail us at geeketeersunite@gmail.com and we will pick our favorite. &#160;If you aren’t careful, you might even win something cool!
