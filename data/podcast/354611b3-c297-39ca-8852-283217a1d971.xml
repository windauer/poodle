            <title>From Earth to Multiverse - The Evolving View of Our Cosmos</title>
            <description>I’m honored to have Physicist Vic Stenger on the podcast today. Stenger is a retired elementary particle physicist and has written many critically well-received popular books that interface between physics, cosmology, philosophy, religion, and pseudo-science. His new book, God and the Multiverse, tells the evolving story of humanity’s understanding of the universe, from ancient times to the present. The book, and our conversation, starts with the ancient Greeks and progresses from an earth-centered model through a sun-centered model of our solar system, moving through the medieval period and onward into the discoveries of Galileo, Newton and Einstien. We discuss the current understanding of Big Bang cosmology, which posits an initial exponential expansion of matter and energy and the creation of lighter elements, and eventually, the formation of stars and heavier elements. Stenger discusses the merits of the multiverse, and ponders what we might discover in the future. He provides us with a fascinating and informative tour of the cosmos and our understanding of it. Join us while we consider this awe-inspiring journey.</description>

            <title>The Christian Bible: A Handbook for the Subjugation of Women</title>
            <description>The Old Testament is notorious for its stories of violence, genocide and atrocity condoned by a fictive god. This alleged scripture is especially heinous to women, and the New Testament offers no refuge, as it advocates a subservient role for women and condones Old Testament barbarism. I’ll discuss both the biblical abuse and Christianity’s ongoing threat toward women today with my guest, Annie Laurie Gaylor. Gaylor is co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Our talk features one of Gaylor’s books, Woe to the Women: The Bible Tells Me So, published in 1981, a guide to the Bible’s mistreatment of women.</description>

            <title>A False History of the West: The Book of Mormon</title>
            <description>The Book of Mormon is holy scripture for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religion with more than 15 million adherents. Earl Wunderli, my guest on today’s show, was raised Mormon, but he eventually questioned the truth claims found in the book, prompting him to embark on a study that was meticulous and exhaustive, taking years to finish. He gathered his findings in a work published in 2013 titled, An Imperfect Book: What the Book of Mormon Tells Us about Itself. The results are surprising and interesting. He’ll tell us about the massive, painstaking effort he undertook, what he discovered and what it means to him. Wunderli has degrees in philosophy and law from the University of Utah. Earlier this year, Biblical scholar Dr. Robert Price praised Wunderli’s work in a book review for Free Inquiry, writing, “This may be the most important book yet written about the Latter-day Saint scripture.”</description>

            <title>Muslim Apostate: Criticizing Islam Vital for Change</title>
            <description>Today I’m talking with a civically active and very public American Muslim apostate, Muhammad Syed, co-founder and director of operations for the Ex-Muslims of North America. The Ex-Muslims of North America’s objectives are providing support and help to ex-Muslims, eradicating the apostasy taboo, and fighting bigotry. The organization is comprised of ex-Muslim non-theists primarily located in or from North America, with various ethnicities and nationalities participating. Syed is going to tell us more about the group and fill us in on some interesting details. He’ll also tell us why he became a non-believer in 2007. We’ll also talk about issues relating to ex-Muslims and criticizing Islam, and the recent controversy involving Ayan Hirsi Ali.</description>

            <title>Religious Conservatives Wrong on Church Freedoms</title>
            <description>Conservative Christians complain that their religious freedoms are under attack partially because women in our country seek to use legal and effective birth control. These methods are included in a larger package of coverage offered in President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. This mandate to include contraceptives vexes the Mennonite owners of Conestoga Wood, a custom wood products manufacturer, and the Southern Baptist owners of Hobby Lobby, a craft store retailer. These proprietors claim that their religious liberty is restricted by the psychic shackles of the contraceptive mandate, distressing their godly conscience. With the enthusiastic support of religious conservatives, the legal attempt to seek an exemption reached the Supreme Court this March. Rob Boston, Director of Communications at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and my guest on today’s podcast, rejects the notion that these business owner’s religious liberty is in jeopardy. He argues that religious conservatives are redefining religious liberty in a flawed and damaging way. Boston has worked at Americans United since 1987. He’s editor of the organization’s Church &amp; State magazine and the author of four books, the most recent published this year titled, Taking Liberties: Why Religious Freedom Doesn’t Give You the Right to Tell Other People What to Do.</description>

He argues that religious conservatives are redefining religious liberty in a flawed and damaging way. Boston has worked at Americans United since 1987. He’s editor of the organization’s Church &amp; State magazine and the author of four books, the most recent published this year titled, Taking Liberties: Why Religious Freedom Doesn’t Give You the Right to Tell Other People What to Do.</media:text>

            <title>Bible Geek Views Jesus as Myth, Book of Acts as Funny Fiction</title>
            <description>A small number of responsible and qualified scholars are currently representing a view of the the historical Jesus that is sure to have Christians rising from their church pews in indignant anger. These scholars are called mythicists, and they claim that Jesus was not an historical person, but a fictional or mythological character invented by early Christians. One popular proponent of the mythicist view is Dr. Robert Price. He is professor of biblical criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute, and he teaches philosophy and religion at the Johnnie Colemon Theological Seminary. Price is the founder and editor of The Journal of Higher Criticism. He is a Fellow of both The Jesus Seminar and The Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, and he is also a Research Fellow for the Center for Inquiry Institute. Price is a prolific author, and he also hosts two podcasts, The Bible Geek and The Human Bible. When I heard that Dr. Price would be in my home town of Portland, Oregon on Thursday, April 10 to deliver a speech titled, The Christ Myth, well, I just had to see if I could catch up to him and ask a few questions.</description>

            <title>Philosopher Argues Against Christianity's Double Standard</title>
            <description>Philosopher Matt McCormick created controversy in the small town of Manteca, California recently by delivering a speech against belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Approximately 300 religious people gathered in front of the library throughout the talk, hosted by the Stanislaus Humanists on January 15. They prayed, swayed and spoke in tongues, encircling the building at one point to shout out the Devil. McCormick joins the podcast to discuss his Manteca experience and his 2012 book, Atheism and the Case Against Christ. McCormick is a professor of philosophy at California State University-Sacramento. He argues that believing in the resurrection on historical grounds is a double standard, since believers reject analogous supernatural claims. McCormick compares the evidence for the resurrection in the Christian tradition to evidence presented during the Salem witch trials. The results are surprising and fascinating.</description>

            <title>Data, Death Threats, and Disinformation: The Climate Debate</title>
            <description>Dr. Micheal Mann, my guest on today’s podcast, says that global warming is real, is caused by human beings, and supports this claim with data both plentiful and compelling. This makes him very unpopular in some circles. Mann has been harassed, maligned and has even received death threats. He is an award winning climate scientist whose work contributed to a Nobel Prize and a 1999 graph dubbed the hockey stick. The graph modeled earth’s climate during the past 1,000 years, and its shape resembles that particular piece of sports equipment – a long shaft of a handle with the blade jutting alarmingly upward. Mann is Distinguished Professor of Meteorology at Penn State University, with joint appointments in the Department of Geosciences and the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI). We discuss his work and his 2012 book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines.</description>

            <title>Minds Held Hostage: Adapted Human Brain Prone to God &amp; Other Gli</title>
            <description>Dr. J. Anderson Thomson, Jr. - you can call him Andy - guides us through a provocative tour of the human brain on religion. Thomson introduces us to the many cognitive adaptations luring us into religious belief and other irrational ideas. One of those ideas happens to be, disturbingly, suicide bombing. He’ll provide an answer to the age-old question of why a talking wolf is more memorable than a tree balancing your checkbook. Thomson’s current research interest is in the area of evolutionary psychology and using its principles to understand depression, suicide terrorism, and religious belief. Thomson wrote the 2011 book, Why We Believe in Gods, A concise guide to the science of faith. He is a psychiatrist in private practice in Charlottesville, Virginia. He is also a staff psychiatrist at Counseling and Psychological Services at the University of Virginia Student Health Services, and the Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy at the University of Virginia.</description>

            <description>Our government has been hijacked by the religious right, and Sean Faircloth wants to return it to its secular past - and he has a plan to do just that. Faircloth is president of Global Secular Organizing &amp; Strategy, or GSOS. I talk to Faircloth about his plan, called SecularityUSA. It uses state-based volunteers - included members of the clergy - and is focused on both short-term and long-term goals. The project's springboard is the 2016 Iowa Caucuses for the next presidential election. Faircloth served as Director of Strategy &amp; Policy at the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason &amp; Science, and served as Secular Coalition for America’s Executive Director, creating its 50-state plan. He is author of Attack of the Theocrats!: How the Religious Right Harms Us All-and What We Can Do About It.</description>

            <title>Scholar Finds Peril &amp; Progress Studying Religion, Society</title>
            <description>Just what kind of affect does religion have on society? Are non-religious societies healthier, more educated, and happier? Are religious liberals more beneficial to a healthy community than fundamentalists, religious moderates or non-believers? And just where, and how, could we find answers to these difficult questions? With me today is Dr. Ryan Cragun, a sociologist of religion at the University of Tampa, in Florida. His research and writing focuses on religion, with an emphasis on Mormonism, the nonreligious and secularization. He'll help us work through some of these tough problems. Where we don't find answers, perhaps we'll at least find some direction or context. We discuss his current book, What You Don't Know About Religion (but Should), published earlier this year. This book deals with precisely the type of questions just posed, and Cragun uses evidence and scholarship when considering them. His results are interesting, and in some cases, surprising.</description>

            <title>Author Explores Odd Beliefs &amp; Peculiar Religious Practices</title>
            <description>During this episode I explore some bizarre and interesting religious traditions with guest Dr. Karen Stollznow, author of the 2013 book, God Bless America: Strange and Unusual Religious Beliefs and Practices in the United States. We’'ll consider a variety of groups, from the Amish to exorcists, from satan worshipers to Scientology practitioners, from old-time voodoo to new age woo-woo. Stollznow discusses her experience with these varied organizations, and what she learned by researching and interacting with them. She corrects more that a few Hollywood stereotypes along the way, including my own, and shares some interesting adventures. Stollznow is a linguist with a background in history and anthropology. Previously a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, Stollznow has spent two decades writing about a diverse array of topics, including language, culture, religion, science, pseudoscience, and the paranormal. She writes the “Bad Language” column for Skeptic magazine and is a research fellow of the James Randi Educational Foundation.</description>

            <description>In our modern world, religious faiths expounding violent end-of-times eschatology are perilously juxtaposed to nuclear weapons; global warming is often poo-pooed by conservative evangelical Christian politicians; and evolution is continuously denied by young earth creationists seeking to dilute the intelligence of our next generation. Science, skepticism and critical thinking are needed now more than ever, a “new trinity,” if you please. These issues are discussed in Dennis R. Trumble's book, The Way of Science: Finding Truth and Meaning in a Scientific Worldview. Trumble is a project scientist in the Circulatory Support Laboratory and an adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. The scientific worldview is vital for humanity’s future and well-being, and Trumble assures us can that science can also be part of a satisfying and fulfilling life.</description>

            <title>Atomic Theory’s Progress Refutes God, Supernatural</title>
            <description>Whenever physicist Vic Stenger writes a book, it’s usually at the expense of god, the supernatural and scientific woo-woo. He spoke to me recently about his current book, God and the Atom, From Democritus to the Higgs Boson: The Story of a Triumphant Idea. Stenger is a retired elementary particle physicist and has written many critically well-received popular books that interface between physics, cosmology, philosophy, religion, and pseudo-science. The success of the atomic model of our universe, with the overwhelming amount of scientific observation and data to support it, renders other explanations of our cosmos obsolete and unnecessary, says Stenger. God and the supernatural, as Stenger has argued for some time now, are failed ideas. Atomism is the concept that reality consists of small, irreducible objects moving through space – particles and the void, as it were – and this idea has been with us for millennia. Stenger chronicles Atomism’s progress from its ancient roots to its present status as found in the standard model of particle physics and the modern search for the Higgs Boson.</description>

Nickell has been investigating the paranormal since 1969, and is a prominent investigator of myths, mysteries, frauds, forgeries, and hoaxes. He has been called 'the modern Sherlock Holmes,' 'the original ghost buster,' and 'the real-life Scully' from The X-Files. He has investigated scores of haunted-house cases, including the Amityville Horror, as well as healers, statues, visions and demons. Nickell was an inspiration for Hilary Swank's role as a miracle investigator in The Reaping (2007).</description>

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Portland State University Professor Peter Boghossian and I discuss his new book, A Manual for Creating Atheists, in which he provides conversational strategies and tactics designed to lead religious believers from faith to reason. Throughout his book Boghossian offers diagnostic methods, provides practical examples, and supports his project with evidence. He also criticizes a disturbing trend in modern liberalism that helps fuzzy reasoning flourish. A Manual for Creating Atheists will be published in November 2013 by Pitchstone Publishing. Boghossian will be appearing at The Amazing Meeting, also known as TAM, July 11-14, 2013, in Las Vegas.</media:text>

            <description>Today's guest is Joy Holloway-D'avilar, co-host of the Freethinking Island podcast, a podcast aimed at a Caribbean audience.

She'll also give us a brief introduction to Rastafarianism, a rather interesting belief system, to say the least. She also gives us a few drink recipes, which should make you fellow rum drinkers very pleased. Joy was born in Barbados and has been living in the NY/NJ area for more than 20 years. She currently works in the radio/television broadcasting industry. Joy is committed to spreading the virtues of reason, critical thinking and true enlightenment instead of blind and mindless faith.</description>

            <title>Faith Fails-Appraise Religion With Skepticism</title>
            <description>Minister-turned-atheist and author John Loftus and I consider how to appraise religions skeptically and fairly. We talk about issues raised in his new book, The Outsider Test for Faith: How to Know Which Religion Is True. In the 1980s Loftus earned three masters degrees in theology and studied under the tutelage of prominent Christian apologist William Lane Craig. He spent 14 years in Christian ministry, and in the 1990s experienced a full-blown crisis of faith. In 2008 he published a book titled Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity. After my discussion with Loftus I'll refute some arguments I recently discovered while visiting Christian apologetic websites. These claims are directly related to Loftus' book and our conversation. That is at the end of the podcast.</description>

            <title>Author Opens Dialogue With Christians</title>
            <description>I’m pleased to welcome author Guy P. Harrison back to the podcast to talk about his new book, 50 Simple Questions for Every Christian. I spoke to him a year ago about his previous book, 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think are True. Harrison’s writing focuses primarily on science and skepticism. He’s held numerous positions in the news industry, including editorial writer, world news editor, sports editor, photographer, page designer, and columnist. His new book is not intended to be argumentative or disrespectful, but to promote dialogue and understanding. Harrison asks questions such as, “What is the born-again experience?” “Why would God want to sacrifice his only son for the world?” “Do miracles really happen?” “How reliable is the Bible?” “What is the rapture?” and, “Why isn’t everyone a Christian?” Harrison follows each question with thoughtful analysis. Throughout the book Harrison takes care never to condescend or treat the reader poorly.

At the end of the podcast I've included audio commentary titled, Islamohysteria: The Misguided Attacks on Sam Harris, starting at the 41:22 mark.</description>

            <title>Author Suggests Neural Mechanism for Transcendence, Beauty</title>
            <description>In his 2007 book, If Not God, Then What? Neuroscience, Aesthetics, and the Origins of the Transcendent, Dr. Joshua Fost connects our recognition of beauty, the ascetically appealing and certain types of religious experience with our desire to find order in our world. He further proposes a neural mechanism for this human feature, using ideas from scientific literature. Fost’s project is, in part, a naturalistic attempt for an explanation of transcendent religious experience. Fost is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and University Studies at Portland State University. His primary research interests are in neurophilosophy and the public understanding of science, critical thinking, and methodological naturalism. He has lectured and written extensively, and his work has been published in many scientific journals. He’s published two articles in Free Inquiry, the first in 2005 titled Fight dogma, not religion, and the most recent in the 2012 October/November issue, titled On being a scientist.</description>

            <description>Faithiest is the title of the recently published book by Chris Stedman, an assistant humanist chaplain at Harvard. The book is a well-written memoir of his life as a young Christian teen who realizes that he’s gay, and whose struggle with religious homophobia led him to the lowest point in his life. After discovering his journal and learning of his plight, Stedman’s mother took him to see a Christian pastor more accepting of his homosexuality. Despite the relief he felt, Stedman eventually became an atheist, whereupon he discovered a different kind of intolerance within the community of nonbelievers. The book is not just a memoir of Stedman’s struggle with his religious and sexual identity - it's a call for civility in our discourse. The book has sparked conversation, comments and criticism. Stedman fields questions about his past as well as his hopes for the future.</description>
