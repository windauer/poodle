                    <description>Jered Kenna sat down with Tina Hui and Matt Schlicht from Follow The Coin to talk about their upcoming event, Dogecon SF, this Friday April 25th in San Francisco. This will be San Francisco's first dogecoin conference, so they have a lot of exciting things planned for the over 700 people who've already registered, such as fun games and costume contest, a special appearance from legendary Dogecoin tipper Hood, themed food &amp;amp; drinks, and a lineup of high-profile speakers including litecoin creator Charlie Lee, Andreas Antonopoulos, and of course, dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer. Although they are accepting donations, tickets to the event are completely free - though they have warned us that they are already over capacity. So if you aren't able to be there, you can still watch the livestream of the event at www.followthecoin.com/dogeconsf.</description>
