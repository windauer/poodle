In this episode we look at Doctor Who merchandising from a collector’s perspective with special guest Richard Nolan who gives us a potted history through the highs and lows of the many examples of ephemera released under the Who banner.

                    <title>42 to Doomsday - Stay on TARGET!</title>
                    <description>Episode 18 - In a desperate attempt to cling to their long vanished youth, Mark and Rob journey back to an earlier, simpler time to discuss the Target Doctor Who range where the only way you could watch the Web of Fear was to read the book. So grab yourself a cup of Milo, Horlicks or Cocoa (ooh, is that a marriage proposal?), sit yourself in your favourite comfy chair and wile away the next 60 minutes or so  listening as the Statler and Waldorf of the Doctor Who podcasting community reminisce about collecting these little fragments of the show’s past. 

Plus we discuss the Series 8 (malt) teaser, listener feedback and our latest competition where you send your burning questions about Doctor Who (or not) that you want us to tackle by the 9th of June and the best entry wins a copy of Doctor Who - The Ultimate Guide as recommended by Rob!</description>

                    <title>42 to Doomsday - We Could Be Villans</title>
                    <description>Episode 17 - Like the super villains they are, Rob and Mark have smashed free of the Phantom Zone to wreak havoc yet again on podcast listening humanity.  Kneel before...pod(cast)!

In this bumper episode we take a look at the villains of Doctor Who, starting with the Tribe of Gum all the way up to that cackling wife beater from Gallifrey.  We talk about the way different writers and production teams influenced how these dastardly fellows were portrayed.  

We also read out some listener feedback, announce the winners of our latest fantastic competition, fondle yet again the omni-bollocks(tm) and Mark does a compelling impression Kim Jong-il!  Finally, we invite the listeners to ponder whether Rob is right - is Davros the true hero of Genesis of the Daleks..?

The Science of Doctor Who hosted by friend of the show Rob Lloyd is touring around Australia. More information can be found at

                    <itunes:summary>Episode 17 - Like the super villains they are, Rob and Mark have smashed free of the Phantom Zone to wreak havoc yet again on podcast listening humanity.  Kneel before...pod(cast)!

In this bumper episode we take a look at the villains of Doctor Who, starting with the Tribe of Gum all the way up to that cackling wife beater from Gallifrey.  We talk about the way different writers and production teams influenced how these dastardly fellows were portrayed.  

We also read out some listener feedback, announce the winners of our latest fantastic competition, fondle yet again the omni-bollocks(tm) and Mark does a compelling impression Kim Jong-il!  Finally, we invite the listeners to ponder whether Rob is right - is Davros the true hero of Genesis of the Daleks..?

The Science of Doctor Who hosted by friend of the show Rob Lloyd is touring around Australia. More information can be found at

                    <description>Episode 16 - In this very special episode of the 42 to Doomsday podcast, Rob and Mark are joined by guest JR Southall, columnist and podcaster extraordinaire.  We chat about his involvement with the Blue Box podcast, the two You and Who volumes of essays and cover his work as a columnist for Starburst Magazine.   
  
Since JR Southall interviewed Philip Morris for Starburst, we take a deep dive into his thoughts on the current state of the Omni-rumour, a discussion we highly recommend to anyone interested in this fascinating topic.

We also discuss Moffat and his arcs, Christopher H Bidmead and Season 18 and who we think is the best Doctor of the modern series. All this plus a blast from the past courtesy of Tachyon TV (the full version of this is at the end of the episode)

                    <description>Episode 15 - The boys from Wolverhampton (sorry, Melbourne) are back and in this episode Rob and Mark jump into the Wayback Machine and go deep, real deep to discuss how the programme tackled historical and pseudo historical stories. But just before their brains fried, they discuss whether the current production team would be brave enough to produce an unadulterated historical story.

All this, plus listener feedback.  Also, for all fans of Doctor Who podcasts not talking about Doctor Who, we nail our sports cred colours to the flagpole and talk Ausssssie Rules Football (AFL)! and your chance to win The Web of Fear on DVD !

Our next episode will feature JR Southall from the Blue Box Podcast, so send us the curly questions you have on your mind by the 2nd of April.</description>

                    <title>42 to Doomsday - The 8th Doctor vs Freddie Mercury</title>
                    <description>Well it's another year over and a new one 's just begun (well nearly). Rob and Mark will be strapping the mikes back on shortly to bring you our first episode of 2014, but to tide you all over in the meantime we bring you our first every minisode! 

Rob parties likes it's 1999 and while he is 'drezzzing for the occasion' he presents you his thesis on the parallels between Queen's classic 1978 track 'Don't stop me now' and the 1996 TV Movie. Heck if you don't believe us listen to the very end of the cast to hear what the late, great Fredrick Bulsara thinks about it all.

Wishing you all a very happy new year at home!</description>
