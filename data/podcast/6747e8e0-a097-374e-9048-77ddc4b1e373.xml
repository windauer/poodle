&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Rejection is the most important thing in life. It forms you as a man. And only one reality exists: how you handle it. We see it as a bad experience when women reject us. We perceive ourselves as having defects. What you need to realize is that when a woman rejects you, it has nothing to do with you. You&amp;rsquo;re always quick to blame yourself. But the problem isn&amp;rsquo;t you. It&amp;rsquo;s her. You just don&amp;rsquo;t see this yet. Getting rejected by women is not only normal; it&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity. Recognize your uniqueness, your power, and that it makes you better, not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- avoid turning rejection into fear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the importance of surrounding yourself with people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why you should not isolate yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- it&amp;rsquo;s all about her insecurities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why she is unable to step up to your level of courage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;How To Handle Rejection From Women. What you let people see is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;How you raise him is how he learns. Period. He learns what you teach him. That&amp;rsquo;s his development.

The good news is that it&amp;rsquo;s easier and more rewarding than you think. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- true cost vs. perceived cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- how to deal with your wife&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why you can no longer have regrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- how to be a parent instead of a coach&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We are raising our boys to be afraid. The coddling of children has taken over grit, bravery and resolve. Are girls more allowed to fend for themselves while boys are over-mothered and overprotected? Is this why American men now are playing dress-up more than women? Are American men desperate for attention? Is vanity and over-sensitivity the new manliness? In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why little boys have stopped acting like boys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- is the gym the new adult playground?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why boys are not expected to fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- some startling statistics regarding grooming products, satchels &amp;amp; breadwinners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Why Men Are Becoming Women. We only have ourselves to blame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Forty is the old age of youth &amp;ndash; and the youth of old age. Nobody wants to believe that he&amp;rsquo;s getting older. But it&amp;rsquo;s the eleventh hour. You have to take a final shot at the buzzer. It&amp;rsquo;s your last chance to make anything happen. And it starts with your health and your finances. You don&amp;rsquo;t get wiser with age. It&amp;rsquo;s just repetition. Improve your health. Improve your finances. And make the final push for success for the rest of your life. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the distinction between habits vs. necessity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why you must drop your ego and go to the doctor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the truth about life insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- you are not dead yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;What You Need To Do When You Turn Forty. Time isn&amp;rsquo;t money &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s everything.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Do you do whatever you want? Do you call the shots and make your own way in the world? We hope so. So long as it&amp;rsquo;s not at the expense of yourself. There&amp;rsquo;s a widespread misconception of manhood in American culture. It&amp;rsquo;s this: My mind and body is a rental car and I&amp;rsquo;m going to treat it as such. Does this make you George Clooney? Frank Sinatra? No. It makes you careless, negligent and lazy. Because the greatest hallmark of manliness is self-control. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why you&amp;rsquo;re insecure about men with self-control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the selfishness of self-neglect when you have kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- peer pressure ends in adolescence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why self-control is the ultimate test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Is Laziness The New Manliness? If it is, America is in bigger trouble than we had thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You thought you had beaten it. You listened to this podcast and thought you had gotten rid of Mansy forever. Now, you&amp;rsquo;re in a new relationship. Bad habits and old patterns have fired up again. In a long-term relationship or marriage, Mansy has reared its head. Again. How did this happen? How did something that was so clear become so central in your life again? The bad news &amp;ndash; the temptation for Mansy always exists. The good news &amp;ndash; your daily vigilance can keep it in remission forever. But it requires recognition, effort and hard work. And it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize the signs of Mansy&amp;rsquo;s return. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- Mansy&amp;rsquo;s life source is laziness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- inaction always brings about bad judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- there&amp;rsquo;s no greater fix than telling the truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the number one sign that you have relapsed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- how Uncle Todd &amp;amp; Dave The Masshole almost relapsed themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Have You Relapsed Back Into Mansy? It&amp;rsquo;s not the end of the world &amp;ndash; only the end of freedom and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nagging vs. Counter-nagging. Nothing is perfect. Effort goes unnoticed. Contributions to living arrangements are criticized. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten it wrong. Maybe men and women can&amp;rsquo;t get along. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ve all done the best we can. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to live apart &amp;ndash; even when we&amp;rsquo;re together. Forget the Man Cave &amp;ndash; how about a Man House? Duplexes for everyone. Compromise doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. There&amp;rsquo;s a separation of Church and State in the United States. Maybe there should be a separation of Men and Women when they&amp;rsquo;re together &amp;ndash; and the dinner table is Switzerland. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- if you can&amp;rsquo;t get it right according to her, maybe you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- is it time for tunnels, requisition orders and written requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- have we ultimately failed to communicate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- has it ever been a good idea?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Why Men And Women Should Live Apart When They&amp;rsquo;re Together. Antarctica is lovely this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Talent is useless. That&amp;rsquo;s right. Stories of wasted talent fill the graveyard. In and of itself, talent cannot flourish without confidence and hard work. Great talents know this. Confidence and hard work are the catalysts &amp;ndash; talent seals the deal. From Michael Jordan to Michael Phelps, they achieved world-class status through confidence and hard work first. This also applies to us &amp;ndash; ordinary people. This mandate leads to success. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- confidence is a choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- hard work itself is a talent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- your talents only flourish via confidence and hard work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- only you can execute this for your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Americans expect perfection and happiness. We have too many choices. The rest of the world expects tragedy; the United States is surprised by it. The same is true with Mansy and his relationships. American men are never happy with what they have. They&amp;rsquo;re always looking around the corner to upgrade. They look for defects where none exist. With a fifty percent divorce rate for people under thirty, it&amp;rsquo;s time to accept that free will and choice have failed. We don&amp;rsquo;t know what we want. And divorce is too easy. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- the astonishing divorce rates in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Mansy deal breakers for men&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why American men don&amp;rsquo;t know how to be happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why we must grow up and accept imperfection&lt;/li&gt;

When you ask her or investigate her sexual past, you only reveal your own insecurities. You&amp;rsquo;re not in competition with old boyfriends. They&amp;rsquo;re gone. What happened in the bedroom with them does not exist anymore. She&amp;rsquo;s with you now. Healthy relationships only exist when the past remains in the past. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class="MsoNormal"&gt;- your stock with her plummets when you show your insecurities about her sexual past&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;American men love to live in drama. They bring it on themselves. But when it comes to problem solving, they forget one fundamental thing &amp;ndash; the task at hand. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s yourself, your relationship or your family, when problems big and small arise you must remember that it&amp;rsquo;s never bigger than you are. It&amp;rsquo;s not about being tough or macho; it&amp;rsquo;s about manning up and handling reality. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why you must remove emotion out of the equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- don&amp;rsquo;t live in the problem &amp;ndash; solve it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- she will only bring you down if you allow it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- family cannot dictate your life&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When a man lies, a woman thinks it&amp;rsquo;s the truth. When he tells the truth, she thinks it&amp;rsquo;s a lie. Men can&amp;rsquo;t win most of the time. But when it comes to her unfounded jealousy, he can. A woman can be jealous if she has probable cause. But if she&amp;rsquo;s jealous for no reason whatsoever, there&amp;rsquo;s a serious problem. If she has trust issues, you must recognize this early. Most men are monogamous, focused and not up to something. But if her ridiculous, groundless jealousy gets in the way, you must handle it now. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- the three steps on how to handle her jealousy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t change your behavior for her fictional reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- you know the truth whether she accepts it or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- how to recognize the signs early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why six months is the deadline&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;One of the most pivotal rites of passage in a relationship is introducing your girlfriend to your mother. The pressure is on her &amp;ndash; and you. There are many pitfalls and landmines along the way. Will they compete for the top position? Are you the number one son? Is your girlfriend a princess ready to cause a problem? And if your mother hates her or doesn&amp;rsquo;t like her, are you ready to man-up and take control? Whose side do you take? And what role do you play? In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why you must prepare your girlfriend before the visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why you must accept the truth about your relationship with your mother&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When it comes to relationships, the game never ends. In childhood, we leverage the game to get what we want. In adolescence into our twenties, we mistake passion for the architecture behind everything we do. In marriage, the game changes from pursuit and drama and becomes about the nest. Different parameters, different expectations, yet still a game. You might think you have found the most fundamentally compatible person on the planet. But awareness and having a game plan are essential. Because it always has, and always will be a game. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- how the game starts in infancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- if you didn&amp;rsquo;t date in high school, you will set yourself back years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- men believe in true love more than women do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- if you don&amp;rsquo;t participate in marriage, your wife will own it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- in marriage, you must hit the reset button and prepare for the new game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Why It Has And Always Will Be A Game. The best way to fight a war is by preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Can you handle sex? Can you handle women? From the time we&amp;rsquo;re teenagers, through our twenties and up until we&amp;rsquo;re married, we think we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;lsquo;the man.&amp;rsquo; In our teens, we&amp;rsquo;ll stick it anywhere, put it anywhere, put anything on it. In our twenties, whether we will admit it or not, we were always looking around for an upgrade. Finally, in a long-term relationship or marriage, we still think we &amp;lsquo;got it,&amp;rsquo; and might make the dumb mistake of creating a second emotional connection with a woman. Is being womanizer a sign of strength or insecurity? Are you desperate for attention? Have you thought about the consequences? In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- think before you act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- why you must be selective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- one-night stands become a problem whether you like it or not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- cheating creates the same problems twice over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- do you prefer your insecurities over your dignity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Why American Men Should Stop Having Sex. This episode is not anti-sex &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s anti-stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a divorced father. The marriage or relationship didn&amp;rsquo;t work out. But you both had children. And there&amp;rsquo;s a particular kind of divorced father that&amp;rsquo;s still trying to work his &amp;lsquo;mojo,&amp;rsquo; that he&amp;rsquo;s still &amp;lsquo;got it,&amp;rsquo; that he&amp;rsquo;s still looking for the love of his life. He&amp;rsquo;s out in the dating scene looking for new, exciting options when it comes to women. The reality: You&amp;rsquo;re a dad. Your top priority is your children. Selfishness is at the bottom of the list. Forget about dating. Forget about falling in love. This is the province of teenagers. You never met &amp;lsquo;The One.&amp;rsquo; The love of your life is your children. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- time towards chasing women is time away from your kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- a divorced dad is never a swinging single&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- time towards children and career will bring about the right woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- setting an example for your son and daughter is more important than getting ass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- how to use diplomacy with their mother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- how to manage disappointment&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Three things are certain in life: death, taxes and a woman trying to change you. Her attempts aren&amp;rsquo;t something you can change. What is within your control, however, is the degree to which you allow your wife or girlfriend to change you. There are extreme cases and not-so-extreme cases. On the one hand, there are women who want to completely change who and what you are. On the other, there are women who want you to improve. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s for your own benefit, but mostly it&amp;rsquo;s for their benefit. What you have to determine &amp;ndash; and recognize &amp;ndash; is when and how this starts, and how to develop a game plan you can manage.&amp;nbsp;In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the distinction between compromise and surrender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the red flag of her changing your religion, career and your relationship with your family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the difference between her passing judgment and wanting you to be better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the importance of speaking up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the truth about your life vs. her truth about your life&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Everybody wants to upgrade. You&amp;rsquo;re tired of second-rate, and settling for second-best. You want to meet better women. You won&amp;rsquo;t achieve this, however, by going to better bars or more upscale nightclubs. The only way to meet better women is by focusing on you. This is the longer, more difficult road. It will take months, even years. But the payoff is greater. Nothing worthwhile is easy, or happens overnight. You need to have higher standards for yourself. This is a process; it&amp;rsquo;s not winning the lottery. And you must start today. In this episode:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can no longer seek only drama and sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to upgrade with women, you must know what you want from life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must identify old patterns and trends and not repeat them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why having responsibility and accountability about your past is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your higher standards begin with you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Why Meeting Better Women Starts With You. And women have nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve told Mansy many things when it comes to women and relationships &amp;ndash; what to look out for, what to avoid, and what to put into practice. This is not to say that we&amp;rsquo;re perfect, that we don&amp;rsquo;t make mistakes. But to have a successful relationship is not a science. You just know that you&amp;rsquo;re in a good one. It should be fun, effortless, and improve the quality of your life. Perhaps enduring many bad relationships might make it difficult to recognize the virtues of a good one. We outline the ten things that should be happening &amp;ndash; a halftime checklist. In this episode:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the importance of no pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mutual respect is a non-issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the phenomenon of involuntary happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of fear of the truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why love means less than you think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The Top Ten Signs Your Relationship Is Working. It&amp;rsquo;s not as difficult as you may think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Like the Male Cheerleader at a college football game, the real-life Male Cheerleader is clueless. He&amp;rsquo;s not Mansy&amp;rsquo;s ally or his enemy &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s just useless. Whether Mansy is dealing with a breakup, a current relationship, or someone he might be interested in, the Male Cheerleader always gives the worst advice. Usually a good friend of Mansy who is happily married, the Male Cheerleader only wants the best for Mansy. Because he&amp;rsquo;s happily married and the pinnacle of what Mansy wants for his life, the Male Cheerleader has been out of the game for so long he no longer lives in reality. He tells Mansy what he wants to hear &amp;ndash; when Mansy should always be seeking out the truth. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Movember is upon us &amp;ndash; Prostate and Testicular Cancer awareness month. Men around the world will grow a moustache to show their solidarity and support for this fantastic cause. And there&amp;rsquo;s no better guest to have on American Mansy Podcast to kick off Movember than facial hair expert and pognologist Dr. Allan Peterkin. Dr. Peterkin is known for his three bestselling books on facial hair: &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair, The Bearded Gentleman: The Style Guide to Shaving Face &lt;/i&gt;(co-written with Nick Burns), and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;One Thousand Mustaches: A Cultural History of The Mo. &lt;/i&gt;He has also contributed or been featured in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The New York Times, The New Yorker, Sports Illustrated, The Wall Street Journal, Men&amp;rsquo;s Health, GQ &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Esquire &lt;/i&gt;as well as the documentary &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Mansome, &lt;/i&gt;directed by Morgan Spurlock (&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Super Size Me&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In this episode, he discusses how to attract a mate (and how not to) via your facial hair; a brief history of the Mo from ancient Egypt to present day; what your facial hair says about you; how to best represent yourself for Movember. Funny, informative and surprising, this interview is not to be missed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Find out more about Dr. Allan Peterkin at &lt;a href="http://www.adpeterkin.com"&gt;www.adpeterkin.com&lt;/a&gt; and about the Movember movement in your country at &lt;a href="http://www.movember.com"&gt;www.movember.com&lt;/a&gt;. Because Movember is #NoMansyWhatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mansy never saw it coming. She dumped you on your ass when you thought everything was great. She blindsided you when you thought you would never meet anyone else like her. And Mansy is left hung out to dry. How to face family and friends? How to conduct yourself at work? What do you say when people ask about her? Mansy must learn damage control when his life changes overnight. In this episode we outline the importance of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication shutdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroying the evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing class in public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defense and counter-defense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing to your strengths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mansy Deep Six prevention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;She Just Dumped You On Your Ass: What Now? You&amp;rsquo;ve been fired. And you owe her nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Like most Americans, Mansy expects to win the lottery. But Mansy lives in Fantasy Land. He always lives beyond his means, never in reality. And when Mansy dates women outside his budget, he will do anything &amp;ndash; anything &amp;ndash; to keep her. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s dinners, vacations, clothes, purses, shoes, even cars, Mansy thinks that it&amp;rsquo;s the manly thing do by giving her the moon. But it&amp;rsquo;s not only her tastes that will cost him &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s between her ears. Not only is she materialistic, her brain is defective also. She&amp;rsquo;s an emotional disaster. If she&amp;rsquo;s high-maintenance financially, she&amp;rsquo;s high-maintenance emotionally. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- why Mansy does this in the first place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- the psychology of spending&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- she always has other things going on behind the scenes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;- what Mansy needs to do to protect himself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If You Can&amp;rsquo;t Afford Her Tastes, You Can&amp;rsquo;t Afford Her. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know who you really are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Have you ever begged someone to please take you back? Have you ever brainwashed yourself into excusing her mistakes? Are you that desperate to not be alone? Then you might be the apology machine for her actions. You have no control over yourself in relationships. She has done or said things that are hurtful to you that you eventually apologize for. Why? Are there no consequences for bad behavior? Does she have no accountability? Are you a willing doormat to the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When you drive away from the hospital as a new dad, you cross a new frontier. Life will never be the same. You must set new goals, new benchmarks for yourself that you must hit on a daily basis. And it&amp;rsquo;s just the three of you &amp;ndash; baby, your wife or girlfriend, and you. Alone. All of your family is out of town. Which friends do you listen to? What must you accept and ignore? When you have nothing to go on, what direction should you go in? After eighteen months of fatherhood, Dave The Masshole shares all of the things you need to know &amp;ndash; and to avoid &amp;ndash; when it comes to being a new father. In this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;American women are at war with themselves. And when it comes to them and their body issues, they have a complaint every minute. There are two ends of the spectrum &amp;ndash; the things she cannot change, and the things she can change. From what they&amp;rsquo;re born with to their unwillingness and laziness to change what&amp;rsquo;s within their control, American women will always have a chronic dissatisfaction with their bodies. How should Mansy navigate this treacherous minefield? What should Mansy do when she complains about what she cannot change? What if he loves the very thing about herself that she hates? And what should Mansy do if she complains about her weight, her appearance, comparing herself to other women and yet does nothing about it? In this episode: the bait you should never take; the strategy of silence; never be an accomplice to mediocrity; how she needs to find her own fix; why you are not responsible for her own perceptions. How To Handle Her And Her Body Issues. It&amp;rsquo;s up to her to find her own happiness. BONUS: We take your phone calls!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mansy loves the easy way out. He cannot make a decision. He ignores the truth. He wants someone else to tell him what to do. But Mansy cannot be blamed here. Leaving someone in your twenties and thirties is difficult. At first, Mansy is made to feel like a jerk, that he didn&amp;rsquo;t man-up and work it out. Second, Mansy lets guilt settle in, and prolongs something he should have left long ago. Finally, he knows he needs to leave &amp;ndash; and we outline the three steps on how to do this. In this episode: strategies she will use to keep you around; her manipulation through sex; why Mansy is always the &amp;lsquo;catch&amp;rsquo;; how to take control of the conversation and your life; the three steps on how to leave. The Best Way To Leave A Relationship. It&amp;rsquo;s time to start learning from your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Do you blame Douche behavior on your genetics, ancestry or your astrological sign? Becoming a Douche in public is graduate level Mansy. It takes the most self-deluded, narcissistic Mansy to be able to advance to Douche. But Douche is aware of his performance. Everything in life is a choice. Douche is like a five year-old desperate for attention, except he&amp;rsquo;s old enough to know better. Are you aware of what these things are? Are you willing to accept it and begin to change? The choice is up to you. We outline the five ways this happens. In this episode: the Douche affliction of acting like a celebrity; the perils of acting like a one-upping Douche; the Douche treatment of store clerks and vendors; blaming Douche behavior on genetics, ancestry, or your astrological sign; classic Douche behavior in restaurants. The Top Five Signs You Might Be A Douche. Prevention is everything. BONUS: We take your phone calls!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Welcome to one of the greatest disappearing acts in human history &amp;ndash; American women giving up on sex. The transition from before marriage to after marriage is astonishing. Before, American women are sexual creatures. Afterwards, they completely surrender. American women don&amp;rsquo;t see it as their job; they see it as a man&amp;rsquo;s privilege. When sex no longer becomes a priority, any relationship is doomed to fail. In most cases, when American women get what they want they stop trying. One look at older European women reveals that a decline in sexual interest has nothing to do with age &amp;ndash; and everything to do with choice. In this episode: why women don&amp;rsquo;t hold themselves to any standard; why Mansy is responsible; the difference between emotional and sexual intimacy; the horrors of the Michigan Haircut; how to prevent this from happening. Why American Women Give Up On Sex. The fate of your relationship is in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mansy loves getting kicked to the curb. And there&amp;rsquo;s no better way for Mansy to experience this than when he dates an older woman in her twenties. Mansy thinks he&amp;rsquo;s landed a prize. But when a woman in her twenties dates a younger guy, she simply cannot handle it. Whether she&amp;rsquo;s a day or five years older than Mansy, she&amp;rsquo;s always going to have a complex about his youth. He will always be childish, his friends childish, with a brain that&amp;rsquo;s underdeveloped. Mansy is forever a character in a video game. In this episode: what happens when women panic as they approach thirty; how Mansy is a novelty until she finds the &amp;lsquo;real thing&amp;rsquo;; why Mansy should always date younger girls in his twenties; why Mansy ends up fighting a losing battle. Why Women In Their Twenties Cannot Handle Younger Men. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s time for her to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Would you move around the world to be with your girlfriend? Should marriage be in the cards? Is it make it or break it time? Or is it time to move on? In the eleventh installment of our interview series Ordinary People, Extraordinary Mansy, we interview our special guest Eli. In his early twenties, he moved halfway around the world to be with his girlfriend - only to discover she had gotten back together with her ex-boyfriend. Finding himself at a pivotal point in his life, he had to decide many things - and ask himself many questions. To complicate matters, Eli was an Orthodox Jew. What criticism and shame would he face from his family? His community? His friends? Not only did he have the courage to move around the world, he left his religion. Ready to face the uncertain road ahead, it's a fascinating story of identity, bravery and redemption. You won't want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mansy is a sucker for drama, not confronting his life, and new ass. This is the perfect recipe the Homewrecker. Mansy might be unhappy in his relationship, but he&amp;rsquo;s unwilling to do anything about it. Homewreckers love an easy target, and Mansy easily complies. The Homewrecker will not solve any problems; she will only create new ones. Mansy still doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that all women are in competition with one another. The Homewrecker loves the chase, and has no true interest in Mansy. In this episode: Mansy&amp;rsquo;s attraction to drama; all women can tell when a man isn&amp;rsquo;t getting sex; why Mansy needs to fix his home situation first; how much is the wife to blame? is losing your family worth it? Are You A Sucker For Homewreckers? Why is it so easy for Mansy to surrender?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On a hot summer&amp;rsquo;s day in July 2011, two regular guys launched the American Mansy Podcast. They had no idea what they were doing. One was two years removed from only having a landline; both had no clue about social media. But they had one thing in common &amp;ndash; Mansy. American Mansy. They had both lived it, breathed it, and were blinded by it. Through American Mansy Podcast, they revealed the epidemic of Mansy in America. Two years, seventy countries and tens of thousands of downloads later, Uncle Todd and Dave The Masshole are just getting started. But it has never been about us; it has always been about you &amp;ndash; our listeners. On our second anniversary, join us as we take you back to how American Mansy Podcast got started &amp;ndash; our mistakes, our obstacles, and our secrets. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done it without you. And we&amp;rsquo;re excited to bring you with us into the future. Which is #NoMansyWhatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Every man has been a two-pump chump. Every single one. Even George Clooney. But nothing rattles Mansy&amp;rsquo;s world more than his perception of his performance in bed. Being a two-pump chump is a myth. It has nothing to do with your manhood. Like most of Mansy&amp;rsquo;s issues, it&amp;rsquo;s all in your mind. In most cases, it has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with your current relationship. Bigger things are at stake and they&amp;rsquo;re spilling into the bedroom. Mansy is only one person away from two-pump chump to two-hour session. In this episode: there is nothing wrong with you; losing alcohol or drugs as a crutch for sexual stamina; home remedies Dave has tried that don&amp;rsquo;t work; applying impossible universal expectations; you&amp;rsquo;re not sexually into her. Why Being A Two-Pump Chump Is All In Your Mind. You might be one breakup away from having confidence forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mansy is like an aspiring Hollywood actress &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s waiting to be discovered. Nothing prepares him better for his grand entrance than by keeping a Mansy journal about his current girlfriend. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a chicken-scratched old notebook or an iPad, Mansy keeps a journal about her for one reason only: he&amp;rsquo;s afraid to man-up to the truth. The intent to document a relationship is the intent to avoid it. Leaving a journal open to discovery is avoiding confrontation and problem solving. It&amp;rsquo;s a ticking time bomb of drama that Mansy should have the decency to turn off by attempting the following: talking to her. In this episode: if you can write it, you can speak it; you&amp;rsquo;re not as interesting as you think you are; stop writing sentences, start making decisions; solve problems in relationships through conversation and communication; no woman likes an over-analytical drama queen. Never Keep A Mansy Journal About Your Girlfriend. Grow up, put your big boy pants on, and speak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You either want to be with someone or you don&amp;rsquo;t. Period. Exes are exes for a reason. You chose to leave that person, or that person chose to leave you. But prolonging and sustaining contact with her ex is a choice. It&amp;rsquo;s Mansy for the ex-boyfriend who won&amp;rsquo;t let go; it&amp;rsquo;s selfish and dramatic for the girlfriend to string him along; and it&amp;rsquo;s wicked Mansy for the new boyfriend to allow it to happen. The Golden Mansy Triangle is one of the biggest wastes of time a man can get involved with. If you&amp;rsquo;re the new boyfriend and you choose to participate in the drama, it exists because you allow it. In this episode: her inconsiderate insecurity and indecision; the ex is around because she allows it to happen; why both men are fighting a losing proposition; why you should skip the ultimatum; what&amp;rsquo;s happening with the ex is going to happen to you. What To Do When Her Ex-Boyfriend Is Still Around. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect you. How much are you willing to put up with?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In life, you don&amp;rsquo;t gain wisdom or intelligence; you only learn through repetition. And since you&amp;rsquo;ve had double the years on the planet as a woman half your age, you know where she&amp;rsquo;s coming from at every turn. Playing the advantage might give you a sense of power. The reality, however, is that it shows weakness. You know the angles; you play the percentages. This type of young woman seeks mentoring; this type of Mansy needs to feel powerful. Dating a woman half your age fills this void. But Mansy cannot accept his emotional immaturity. In this episode: the myth of the Male Dating Formula; young women wasting their youth on older men; why age-appropriate women are on to Mansy; when the relationship is a lie; how she damages future relationships with other men. Never Date Women Half Your Age. It&amp;rsquo;s only your time, money, dignity and reputation at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Are you going to start an affair in a broom closet with your wife in attendance? No. You&amp;rsquo;re not an idiot. But Mansy has other plans. Mansy likes drama. He likes a stage to perform on, to be the center of attention. And what Mansy needs to realize is that a wedding is about his friend and his bride &amp;ndash; not him. Getting wasted and hooking up might be Mansy&amp;rsquo;s agenda. But it&amp;rsquo;s time he showed some restraint like a man. In this episode: leaving your issues with the couple-to-be at the door; the importance of generosity; the difference between high school prom and a wedding; you&amp;rsquo;re not the life of the party; how to stand out by not standing out.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Men get soft in marriage for one reason only &amp;ndash; they allow it. There&amp;rsquo;s a myth that you gain wisdom and intelligence with age. The truth, however, is that you only learn through repetition. This begins right after you graduate from Douchebag University, the subject of our last episode. If you enroll in the middle-class welfare system known as student loan and credit card debt, marry the college sweetheart, and fail to risk in your twenties, you run the risk of getting soft in marriage in your thirties and forties. You become a member of the &amp;lsquo;life sucks; then you die&amp;rsquo; club. Is this what you want for your life? In this episode: Dave&amp;rsquo;s secret on how to keep up healthy, thriving marriage; the importance of leveraging risk in your twenties; the fallout of marrying the college sweetheart; why you lose your edge and become complacent; why your life is never over. Why American Men Get Soft In Marriage. Your life is finite; to squander it is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Are you still hanging out with your college &amp;lsquo;boys&amp;rsquo; decades after graduation? The college experience is one of the most overrated facets of American life. When it comes to finances, relationships, and self-perception, Mansy must be extremely careful when it comes to allowing the college experience to shape his life. Although there are many positive aspects of the college experience, Mansy needs to protect himself from allowing it to set him up for failure. In this episode: avoiding scams dressed up as innocence; college is a business; education a by-product; the importance of risk in your twenties; how to avoid a mid-life crisis; where you go to school doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Are You A Graduate Of Douchebag University? Prevention and change are always within reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one thing every human being is entitled to: time spent alone. In a relationship, one person cannot feel that he or she has less freedom than the other. Mansy fears her reaction when he chooses to spend time without her - either by himself or with friends. If this fear accumulates over time, he will become afraid to live. Men do very little for themselves. They must understand that a relationship is like a child: you have to teach it how it&amp;rsquo;s going to work. In this episode: how to establish mutual respect; how to enjoy what you do without apology; how to strategize by thinking like her; how to avoid wanting to control her. Why Are You Afraid Of Her? In order to stand your ground, you must establish it first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There are many things Mansy doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand about women. There&amp;rsquo;s a universal truth about relationships he must accept. Six months into a relationship, Mansy should know if the relationship has the gas to go the distance. At the two-year mark, she&amp;rsquo;s thinking about marriage. Mansy has to accept this. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to marry her, he must have an exit plan. If he wants to build a life with her, he must get over his fear and commit to her. Either way, he must have the balls to be straight with her &amp;ndash; and himself. In this episode: how Mansy can use this to his advantage; why the first six months reveal Mansy at his most vulnerable; the deception of hot sex; why women want Mansy to control the relationship conversation; the consequences of wasted time and regret. You Must Accept The Six-Month Two-Year Rule. Bravery is everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Life is often taken for granted. We go through our daily lives always forgetting that it could be much worse. And then boom &amp;ndash; the doctor says that you need to come back for more tests. In the tenth installment of our interview series Ordinary People, Extraordinary Mansy, we interview the very non-Mansy Drew Bialko, children&amp;rsquo;s book illustrator and author. He was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Desmoid Tumors. It affects three in every one million people. He shares his courageous story on how to live, accept and prevail over the unknown on a daily basis. In this episode: what to do when you get the news; the number one thing not to think about; the importance of perspective and truth; the importance of pressing on. This is an interview not to be missed. For more information, visit the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation at &lt;a href="http://www.dtrf.org"&gt;www.dtrf.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In one of our most pivotal episodes, we discuss and strip down Mansy to its essence. With the arrival of many brand new listeners and newsletter subscribers from around the world, we saw the need to refresh the definition of what and who Mansy is &amp;ndash; and what he must do in order to become a man. Succinct, articulate, humorous and clear, this episode leaves no doubt as to why Mansy is an epidemic in America &amp;ndash; and around the world. To start, the five Pillars of Mansy: lack of self-confidence; lack of self-preservation; overkill in maintaining other people&amp;rsquo;s happiness; fear of loneliness; lack of restraint. From there, what makes a man: not caring about other people&amp;rsquo;s opinions; a consistent attitude towards life; no need for women to define him; not accessible to everybody; never afraid to say No. How To Transform From Mansy Into Man. It&amp;rsquo;s all right here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Not only does Mansy love drama, but he&amp;rsquo;s also the king of self-neglect. He wears this crown proudly, especially after a serious breakup. What he always fails to realize is that after a breakup it&amp;rsquo;s never his loss. If it ended badly, he forgets that his good qualities remain intact &amp;ndash; and she is not permitted access to them anymore. If it ended amicably, he just hasn&amp;rsquo;t met the right person. But his insecurities kick in and he thinks she&amp;rsquo;s the one who got away, when it was just another chapter in his life. It&amp;rsquo;s a major turning point in his life &amp;ndash; he can either drive himself to be better, or fall into the Mansy Deep Six. In this episode: why freedom is scarier than imprisonment; why you must reflect coldly on a past relationship; how you are not losing in your life; she must earn your good qualities; your friendship is not an entitlement. Why It&amp;rsquo;s Never Your Loss. In divorce, there are settlements. In life, no one is owed anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Tarot cards, horoscopes, fortunetellers, psychic friends &amp;ndash; desperate times call for desperate measures. And desperate measures call for desperate Mansy. This is something no American man would dream of revealing. But when Mansy seeks out fortunetellers or psychic hotlines to figure out his relationship, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize his life is spinning out of control. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as if Mansy is living in a trance. When Mansy relies on outside powers to tell him the truth about his life, he officially has zero control. In this episode: how many psychics has Dave visited? what seems harmless is a serious red flag; are you at the end of your rope? the cycle you&amp;rsquo;re afraid to leave. Do You Have A Mansy Psychic Friend? That visit to the carnival might be a desperate cry for help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a specific kind of woman that&amp;rsquo;s got Mansy&amp;rsquo;s number &amp;ndash; the helpless, beautiful Damsel In Distress. She&amp;rsquo;s got his number because Mansy wants her to have it. She can make Mansy do a little dance on his head because the helpless, beautiful woman has always been out of his league. Mansy needs to realize that the independent, strong, self-sufficient woman is what he should be seeking out &amp;ndash; not helpless women who have gotten by on their looks. If she cannot take care of herself, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to take care of you. In this episode: the difference between women who love attention and those who are desperate for attention; why it&amp;rsquo;s the Prince Charming Syndrome on steroids; the signs to look out for; why young men and divorced men fall into the same trap. Why You Must Avoid Helpless Beautiful Women. Don&amp;rsquo;t look for someone to save &amp;ndash; or for someone to save you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Long after a serious breakup, Mansy will create in his mind every scenario possible where he can become The Invisible Mansy &amp;ndash; watching her where she drinks, where she works, trying to influence her thoughts, having imaginary conversations with her &amp;ndash; all from his imagination while drinking in his recliner at home. He also becomes a time traveler, placing himself in her path after the breakup with her new boyfriend. He even inhabits her best friend&amp;rsquo;s body in order to evaluate and audit the ex-girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s decision making. It&amp;rsquo;s American Mansy at its craziest. In this episode: how Mansy transforms into inanimate objects to get her back; how Mansy tries to use mental brain waves to bring her back; Mansy&amp;rsquo;s secret alliance; why women never remember Mansy, only the non-Mansy; how Mansy needs to stop living in the past and move on.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Unconditional love might be one of the biggest myths in our culture. An unlimited supply of anything is appreciated less. If you have access to money that never runs out, you will not only appreciate it less, you will act more foolishly with it because there are no consequences or set parameters. You will respect it less. Mansy needs to learn the faulty logic behind this. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that everything has a limit. You don&amp;rsquo;t constantly write checks to someone and expect nothing in return. Mansy&amp;rsquo;s love and attention becomes an investment of diminishing returns. In this episode: love is action, not emotion; how not to overpromise and under-deliver; just like life, a relationship is a marathon, not a sprint; and the number one unspoken, unwritten condition Mansy won&amp;rsquo;t admit to. Why Unconditional Love Is A Myth. Living within your means has nothing to do with money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Ass &amp;ndash; it blinds American men. If she&amp;rsquo;s hot, Mansy will look the other way and ignore warning signs and red flags that he should be paying attention to. It&amp;rsquo;s one of Mansy&amp;rsquo;s many issues. But women have quite a few issues of their own. How do you recognize a woman with &amp;lsquo;issues&amp;rsquo;? How do you manage it? Is the relationship or sex worth it?

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This episode is essential listening. Like David Attenborough out in the jungle, Dave and I have witnessed countless hours of Mansy in his natural habitat &amp;ndash; restaurants and bars. Nowhere is Mansy more susceptible to Mansy-like behavior than when he&amp;rsquo;s out in public playing the drama queen. Today is Mansy&amp;rsquo;s lucky day. Not only does he need to recognize this behavior in others, he needs to recognize it in himself. In this episode: why Mansy is desperate for attention; when conflict becomes evasion; the truth about hitting chairs, wearing sunglasses inside, berating inanimate objects; what Mansy reveals with Bathroom Standing and the Side-To-Front Pose. Top Ten Signs You&amp;rsquo;re A Mansy At A Bar. You had no idea &amp;ndash; or did you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When Andy Warhol said that everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes, he had no idea he would also be referring to Mansy and his relationships. When Mansy first meets a woman, the first fifteen minutes are crucial. If Mansy is at his best, this super-version of him mysteriously disappears, never to be heard from again. If he strikes out and persists, he sentences himself to a lifetime of Mansy. In this episode: getting caught off-guard is a good thing; your ego is your worst enemy; if women start to change you, they are no longer interested; drama is a choice. Have Your 15 Minutes Of Fame With Women Passed You By? It&amp;rsquo;s an easier fix than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Men trump themselves, women set unfair expectations, and Mansy is left out in the cold. How can Mansy get it right? In this episode: a list of outside-the-box gifts that do not work - and ones that do; should you buy lingerie? the importance about talking about the holidays in the beginning of the relationship; what you should be doing throughout the relationship to defuse Valentine's Day; how to play the long game; what American women are getting wrong; what women need to accept about the Super Bowl.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When it comes to the American Dream, no one is more sentimental and ridiculous than American men. Far worse than women, they want the white picket fence, the two-car garage, the happily ever after. They just won't admit it. They get these ideas from Hollywood movies and popular music - and it all started with Meatloaf's 'Paradise By The Dashboard Light' from Bat Out Of Hell. Yes, he sucks. But he sucks in a way you could never have imagined. In this episode: Dave takes you through why this song, album, and its sequels have influenced generations of Mansy; the myth of the small town Cinderella story; the context of its release in American history; how to be a man when confronted with sentimental drivel. The Valentine's Day Song That Launched The Mansy Generation. Put your beer bottle microphone down and pay your tab. It&amp;rsquo;s time to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A true leader doesn&amp;rsquo;t call himself one &amp;ndash; he just leads. Mansy, however, as the self-anointed &amp;lsquo;Player&amp;rsquo; might perceive himself as a person of strength. The truth is that he reveals himself as a person in hiding &amp;ndash; and women see right through this. If The Player is incapable of confronting himself, he&amp;rsquo;s incapable of having mature, grown-up relationships with women. In this episode: the conquest of women &amp;ndash; insecurities revealed; incapacity of dealing with mature women; lack of self-control = lack of manliness.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;She&amp;rsquo;s put you on a waiting list. She likes oral sex or she doesn&amp;rsquo;t. She prefers sex only when she&amp;rsquo;s drunk. Or she wants sex only when she&amp;rsquo;s ready and you&amp;rsquo;re not. Many scenarios, many questions. This may seem innocuous or a matter of preference. But the raw truth is that what happens in the bedroom will happen in life. This information is not to be ignored. In this episode: what oral sex (or the lack of it) reveals; why sex reveals her true personality &amp;ndash; and yours; sexually compatible or not &amp;ndash; she is who she is. Everything You Need To Know About Her Happens In The Bedroom. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If you get a second chance at life &amp;ndash; do you give a bad relationship a second chance? In the fifth installment of our interview series Ordinary People, Extraordinary Mansy, our special guest The Brooklyn Patriot bravely traces some of the tragedy in his life that finally lead to one of the most important facets of redemption &amp;ndash; self-control. From early tragedy to honorably serving our country in the U.S. Army, he details the fine line you must walk between structure and risk, the importance of restraint in a relationship, and how to live after nearly losing his life to a rare, life-threatening illness. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful, often funny story of bravery, redemption, forgiveness, and the difficulties in managing freedom of choice and the consequences therein. A compelling and fascinating interview, you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nothing kills the spark in relationship more quickly than expecting her to be your best friend. Ending up in the &amp;lsquo;friend zone&amp;rsquo; in a relationship is no different than ending up in the &amp;lsquo;friend zone&amp;rsquo; when you&amp;rsquo;re after somebody. It kills romance, your sex life, and any spark that made you attracted to each other in the first place. If she becomes your best friend, it leaves your relationship with nowhere to go. In this episode: losing illogical, unrealistic expectations; avoiding lifelong unhappiness; preventing the safe &amp;amp; comfortable. Why You Should Never Become Best Friends With Your Wife Or Girlfriend. You were never after friendship &amp;ndash; you were after excitement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Most women want one of three things: to live with her man, to have children with him, or to marry him. Sometimes, in order to get one of these three things, a woman will issue an ultimatum. The stark truth about a woman&amp;rsquo;s ultimatum, however, is that it&amp;rsquo;s a double standard. Instead of taking responsibility for her own life, the ultimatum puts the burden of the situation on the man. It makes it easier for her to leave him, thus giving her someone to blame. In this episode: the power of leverage &amp;ndash; walking away; her inability to accept responsibility; being &amp;lsquo;put on the spot&amp;rsquo; with your life. The Double Standard Of A Woman&amp;rsquo;s Ultimatum. There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to say goodbye &amp;ndash; just do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It boils down to something more important: having some class.

Online dating is more popular than ever. Like social media, it simplifies the process of people meeting each other and connecting. Yet there&amp;rsquo;s one major flaw with the system &amp;ndash; human beings. People are people, and given a platform to take advantage of a situation, they will take it for better or for worse. In this episode, Mr. Wizard takes you through the following: the pitfalls to avoid; the great things about online dating; what it costs; how to set up a profile; the real type of women available; always drama, always strategies; turtles, shellfish obsessions &amp;amp; the Chicago Bears. It&amp;rsquo;s an interview you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;American men have a need to overcompensate for perceived deficiencies they think they have. One of the most common ones is losing your hair. The cover-up, the combover, the hairpiece, the rug &amp;ndash; this is perhaps the most common fix for most men when the onset of age has come a bit too early. Our very own Dave The Masshole was only nineteen years old &amp;ndash; and planning to get a hairpiece. What drove him to do it? How did he perceive himself? And how did he finally get rid of it forever? In this episode: the realities of going bald as a teenager; how, physically, do you wear one; the commitment &amp;ndash; time &amp;amp; money; sex &amp;amp; taking showers; relationships with &amp;amp; without a hairpiece; the experience of going bald. Why Dave Wore A Hairpiece In His Twenties &amp;ndash; the before, during, and after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been one year since we launched American Mansy &amp;ndash; the epidemic of Mansy in America, and the American man&amp;rsquo;s inability to handle money, time, himself, and the American woman. Women now see the epidemic in men; men see it themselves. The word &amp;lsquo;Mansy&amp;rsquo; now circulates in the English language &amp;ndash; now with its truer meaning. But has Mansy in America gotten any better? Or has it gotten much worse? In this episode: the litmus test of bars &amp;amp; restaurants; Mansy in advertising &amp;amp; professional sports; awareness brings responsibility. State Of The Union, State Of The Mansy &amp;ndash; Are You Better Off Now Than One Year Ago? Our First Anniversary show. In Season Two &amp;ndash; time to get in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;American men have gotten soft. Our softness is represented in our movies, our music, our culture. We need to quit making spectacles of ourselves. We live in fear. We need to turn our fear into action. This is the bedrock, the foundation of American Mansy. Not putting fear into action is why we fail at our jobs, our identities, and our relationships with women. This is why we have the epidemic of American Mansy today. In this episode: the bravery in accepting you&amp;rsquo;re ordinary; accepting strengths as much weaknesses; the disrespect of time. Why The American Man Is Afraid To Stand Alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not time to step up to the plate &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s time to get onto the pitcher&amp;rsquo;s mound, and send one right down the middle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nothing freaks a woman out more than Mansy trying to be one step ahead of her at all times in the beginning. And nothing is more stupid than when Mansy reveals unnecessary, useless information to her when he&amp;rsquo;s in the doghouse or trying to get out himself out of a jam. The more he seeks to please her, the more he will want her to punish him when things go bad. If Mansy insists on spoon-feeding her cr&amp;egrave;me brulee in a restaurant, Mansy will also concede every last bit of his dignity when the relationship goes bad. In this episode: over-preparing and over-indulging; volunteering unnecessary information; revealing stalker-ish DNA. Why Finishing Her Sentences Will Finish You. It&amp;rsquo;s all in the details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s something many American women aspire to, whether they admit it or not, and she&amp;rsquo;s someone that Mansy aspires to be with. Soccer is to middle-class people what polo is to rich people. If you have the financial wherewithal to pack the minivan and take the kids to soccer practice, you&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;lsquo;made it.&amp;rsquo; Can Mansy afford the Soccer Mom? Is the Soccer Mom the trophy Mansy always wanted? Or did he surrender his life a long time ago?

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Real women are self-possessed, confident, and intelligent. Insecure women play games to validate themselves through manipulation, strategies, and gamesmanship. In the beginning of all relationships, there&amp;rsquo;s always a test question: &amp;ldquo;Do you ever want kids?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;How do you feel about marriage?&amp;rdquo; Other declarative statements, however, set the stage for war. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t play games&amp;rdquo; is one of them. She makes this statement when she knows Mansy has no idea who he&amp;rsquo;s dealing with. In this episode: letting your guard down too early; early signs of Soulsucker relapse; unable to see the big picture. What She Really Means When She Says &amp;lsquo;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Play Games.&amp;rsquo; Settle in and put the gloves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The truth, however, is that the dog is a representation of what the owner is willing to handle. Is she committed to the big beautiful Golden Retriever or Siberian Husky? Or is she over-accessorized with a dyed-red pocket rat stuffed in her Coach purse? What about a ferret or a snake? Mansy should never ignore this gold mine of information. In this episode: the Ferret Advisory &amp;ndash; the hostage-taking of exotic animals; more than one cat &amp;ndash; run to the hills? stuffed animals and the first impression. What A Single Woman&amp;rsquo;s Pets Reveal About Her. There are few guarantees in life. This is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pick-Up Artist Community is one of the biggest scams that Mansy needs to look out for. They are con artists preying on guys who lack confidence, offering to help Mansy to better their lives when they just want to line their pockets with Mansy&amp;rsquo;s money. This is not just douche &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s cowardly. In this episode: the PUA as mental midget; playing a character instead of being a man; a predator terrified of his own insecurities.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nice Guys Finish Last is a popular phrase in our culture. It suggests that Nice Guys that are too open, trusting, honest, and kind are always surpassed by the Asshole, the guy who doesn&amp;rsquo;t care what he needs to do to win, get the girl, finish in first. Mansy loses to the Asshole also. But what Mansy doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize is that he needs to adopt some of the methods of the Asshole in order to evolve from Mansy to real Man &amp;ndash; a real Man as defined by someone who knows himself, can defend this, and has security enough with himself that he&amp;rsquo;s neither Mansy nor Asshole, just himself. In this episode: self-control and defending your own weirdness; learn from The Asshole &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t become one; becoming the best version of yourself. How Not To Be The Nice Guy Who Finishes Last. Your own independence is the prize.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;American Women are afraid of relying on their natural beauty. If they are, they&amp;rsquo;re afraid of relying on themselves. All too often, American Women over-process the natural beauty that already exists: too much makeup, fake titties, fake eyelashes, plastic surgery, over-dressing, over-accessorizing, and misrepresenting themselves to the point of clown-foolery. They don&amp;rsquo;t realize that this makes them unattractive to men. Real men. They will only attract American Mansy. Mansy falls for counterfeiters all the time; he needs to learn that he&amp;rsquo;s looking in all the wrong places. In this episode: fear what you&amp;rsquo;re attracted to; appearance is a choice; attraction to fake beauty is attraction to drama. Is She A Counterfeiter? Can Mansy see the signs?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You and your wife or girlfriend are planning to have a baby. Think it&amp;rsquo;s like TV or the movies? Think again. The majority of the attention before, during and after pregnancy is focused on the mother. Little attention, however, is focused on the father. Since dads don&amp;rsquo;t pay the physical price, their roles seem reduced in this process &amp;ndash; but they are just as important. The reality of pregnancy for men is quite different. In this episode: broodmares &amp;amp; stud bulls &amp;ndash; taking the sex out of sex; how to manage the agendas and opinions of family and friends; managing the hustle of baby registries &amp;amp; baby books; finding the right doctor&amp;amp; the myth about classes; what to do when you get The Call; entering the unknown when you leave the hospital to begin a family. We interview a brand-new father &amp;ndash; our very own Dave The Masshole &amp;ndash; to learn from his real-life experiences on What To REALLY Expect When Expecting &amp;mdash; For Men. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a Mansy. Take some notes and be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a myth in American culture that the thirties are the new twenties. Not only is this incorrect, it&amp;rsquo;s an excuse for people not to grow up. This perception sets up Mansy for a pre-midlife crisis without him knowing it. If he hasn&amp;rsquo;t learned his lessons from the mistakes he made in his twenties, he enters a vicious cycle of committing the same mistakes, over and over again, with his career, money and relationships, without any end in sight. The thirties are the dividing line. In this episode: if you don&amp;rsquo;t make it happen now, it may never; seeking the best version of yourself; handling outside pressure; happiness &amp;ndash; a choice. The fourth and final part of The Origins &amp;amp; Signs You&amp;rsquo;re A Mansy &amp;ndash; The Crisis Of Your 30s. Time to grow up, circle the wagons, and make a plan and a playbook for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this episode: reality vs. the idea of reality; the danger of marrying the college sweetheart; lack of career focus; a pre-midlife crisis?

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In colleges and universities all over America, Mansy prototypes need to be studied under their high-pressure economic and hormonal conditions to determine Mansy&amp;rsquo;s behavior and tendencies. University is where the Mansy prototype is taken on test drives over, and over, and over again. When Mansy left high school, he was ill equipped. When he leaves college, the brake lines are cut. It is the place where Mansy is supposed to get an education in life and economics. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s sex camp with books, where Mansy gets a PhD in stupidass-ness, lack of self-control, and a case of full-blown Mansy. In this episode: the misguided search for your future wife in college; the myth of college as a brass ring; a fictional economic &amp;amp; romantic world of college; a sanctioned, extended adolescence? The Origins &amp;amp; Signs You&amp;rsquo;re A Mansy &amp;ndash; Part 2: The Idiot College Years. When will Mansy grow up?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this episode: girls are taught to be strong, independent &amp;amp; self-reliant &amp;ndash; boys are not; a boy&amp;rsquo;s journey into manhood not taken seriously; teenage invincibility &amp;ndash; the Mansy breeding ground; the Mansy diploma when you turn eighteen.

In relationships, Mansy is always worried about whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re going to have fun. Just like in life, it either is or it isn&amp;rsquo;t. And the funny thing about fun is that the less you worry about fun, the more fun you&amp;rsquo;ll have. In this episode: is the expectation of fun an entitlement? dating is supposed to be fun &amp;ndash; or why do it? settling and fear of loneliness. Why Mansy Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Take Having Fun So Seriously. When Mansy accepts this, only then can he start having fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Is the epidemic of Mansy as widespread in Europe as it is in the United States? Are public displays of affection as obnoxious and annoying? Why are older European women hotter and sexier than older American women? And what about all those scarves? Dave The Masshole interviews Uncle Todd fresh from his recent trip to Spain and Portugal. In this episode: are European men worse than American men; do women run Spain; what do Spanish women think of American men; are European women more difficult than American women. Is European Mansy As Bad As American Mansy? There&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With bravery and courage, she shares the story of her marriage and divorce, and the cost of completely giving yourself over to another person. A beautiful, intelligent, self-possessed, thirty-two year-old woman, Venus gives a cautionary tale of what happens when Mansy is ignored in the beginning of a relationship, plus what American women are unwilling confront in their own lives. A must-listen for both men and women, When You Give Up Everything For The One &amp;amp; Only Love is a compelling portrait of a life lived, of love, loss, hope, forgiveness, and redemption. The show also features the music of Paul Calzaretta. You won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If she&amp;rsquo;s going out with her friends, she&amp;rsquo;s just going out with her friends. Without probable cause, you&amp;rsquo;re just a garden-variety psycho.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Have you ever fallen in love with a Soulsucker? All men, all women have had them. If you&amp;rsquo;ve had three bad relationships, you have returned to the same Soulsucker but in three different human forms &amp;ndash; the trial, the sentencing, the execution. Each of those human forms shared the same characteristics &amp;ndash; what drove you crazy, what turned your life upside down, what made you do things you regret. There is no greater mystery in human relationships than your attraction to the Soulsucker. If Mansy doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize the signs after the third one, he&amp;rsquo;s doomed to be tortured by Soulsuckers for the rest of his life. In this episode: why you are attracted to what&amp;rsquo;s bad for you; why Mansy is most vulnerable in his twenties; why Soulsucker #2 appears different from the first but is exactly the same; why mishandling the fallout from Soulsucker #3 could affect the rest of your life. As always, this starts with Mansy ignoring his intuition. As always, this starts with the bedrock of American Mansy &amp;ndash; fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The same applies to sex. Men don&amp;rsquo;t know how to say No. They should know how to say No. But if they do &amp;ndash; women think there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with them. In this episode: being selective and what it says about you to you; knowing what you don&amp;rsquo;t want more important than what you do want; not settling for second-rate &amp;ndash; expect only the best. Why Men Are Afraid To Sexually Reject Women. Be smart. Be selective. Just say No.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The relationship is over. But nobody wants to admit defeat. Battle lines are drawn, and both sides dig in and stand their ground. So what becomes the weapon of choice? High-octane, turbo-charged, Mansy-Ass Baiting. In this episode: women bait men in fear of pulling the trigger to leave; men bait women in desperation and impotence to not let her go; did Dave fake a lawsuit or a visit to a hospital to keep a girl around? BONUS: the bait men use that they won&amp;rsquo;t speak of and that women don&amp;rsquo;t know about. Are You The Baiting Mansy? It&amp;rsquo;s time to get some balls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The purpose of life is to evolve &amp;mdash; to change; to become better, smarter and more focused. It takes balls to make significant change in your life; it takes guts to sustain this change. New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions, however, are Mansy. They&amp;rsquo;re Mansy because nobody sticks to them, they&amp;rsquo;re easy to declare, and worse than that, they cause cancer.

Everyone has insecurities. It's part of being human. Insecurities don't define you; it's how you choose to handle them that define you and your character. Facing and accepting your shortcomings is bravery. Controlling women because of your own insecurities is not only cowardly, weak, and a lack of self-control &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s 100% Mansy. He needs a trophy because he has nothing else to back it up. In this episode: accepting being ordinary; a follower, not a leader; self-loathing and narcissism. Mansy Controlling Guy.

Should you have been behind the wheel of a marriage at 24 after that last keg stand? Marriage isn&amp;rsquo;t taken seriously in America anymore. Why would Mansy be any different?

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This week: Dave The Masshole interviews Uncle Todd! In society, it has been unacceptable for people to decide to stay single or to be alone into their late 30s or early 40s. Society looks at this decision as if you are a hermit or someone who&amp;rsquo;s married to their job. But for these people there are questions. Has time passed you by? And at 40 &amp;ndash; what now? Do you have everything you want? Or have you lived in fear? In this episode: the stigma of being an unmarried man; pressure from society to have a family; living on your own terms. Have you ever said to yourself that I&amp;rsquo;m Thirty-Nine Years Old, No Kids, No Wife &amp;ndash; What Now?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You're a grown man. Blaming your past is Mansy &amp;ndash; an easy way out of accountability. But examining the origins of Mansy helps to cure Mansy. And the Disney animated movies you grew up with may have brainwashed you into a 21st Century Mansy. In the 1940s, these movies sentimentalized animals; in the 1950s, they sentimentalized people. In this episode: faceless, nameless princes; deception through transformation; and what evil stepmothers and mother-in-laws have in common.

In this episode: are you just afraid to be alone?; how long should you wait; what men won&amp;rsquo;t admit when it comes to &amp;lsquo;soul mates.&amp;rsquo; In a new relationship, observe early, observe often, and accept the truth about Why Sexual Compatibility Is Non-Negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a huge difference between having manners and Mansy. Having manners is having common consideration; Mansy is being an around-the-clock, always available, indentured emotional Sherpa. Women like strong men. Prince Charming has it backwards. Soft, pliable, and at-the-ready, this is the last thing a woman wants. This syndrome rewards bad behavior and has given American women a sense of entitlement. In this episode: when not to confuse generosity with Mansy; how not to overwhelm women; how not to live in a fairy tale.

                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In America, it is considered weak for men to talk about grief and loss. Not here. Without getting touchy-feely New-Agey Mansy, we offer sound, logical advice on the six distinct stages a man goes through after a serious breakup or divorce. Many American men are unaware of what the Mansy Deep Six is; they might be in the middle of it right now. And mishandling grief will make you prone to serious mistakes with women in the future. We discuss regaining control over your life; setting attainable goals; when selfishness is a virtue; and how confidence is a fundamental skill that you&amp;rsquo;re not born with, but something you build over time. The rewards are high, but nothing worthwhile happens overnight. The Mansy Deep Six &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s always a way out, there&amp;rsquo;s always a light at the end of the tunnel, there&amp;rsquo;s always a way out of Mansy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Trixie peaks in high school; the Dork peaks during the playoffs &amp;ndash; life &amp;ndash; when it counts. In the bedroom and in life, the Trixie is into herself; the Dork is into you. The Trixie has had everything handed to her; Dorks have learned to survive on their own &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;ve earned it, and are more confident, self-possessed, interesting women. The Trixie is a job that requires an application; the Dork is the purest form of a real American woman. The Trixie is an unattainable, annoying waste of your time; the Dork is the new normal in Twenty-First Century America. Run With The Dorks &amp;ndash; and learn Why Dorks Are The Greatest Women In America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
