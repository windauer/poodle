                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a four-man cast this week, Emdee and Draeno once again by Charles of &lt;a href="http://thehappinesspatrol.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Happiness Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and fellow cohort Malcolm. The topic list appears to have been thrown out as is known to happen when more than three people take part in the podcast. Topics for the bounce all over because of this from convention illness or diseases much worse, the President signing the cell phone unlocking bill, random government policies, issues with flying, Apple&amp;#8217;s deal with Beats closes with a weird commercial, Bose suing Beats in Texas, virtual assistants, Nokia and Microsoft protests in China, Microsoft suing Samsung over Android licensing fees, Apple&amp;#8217;s e-book case, Aereo&amp;#8217;s woes and television issues, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; and other superhero issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware this episode talks briefly about &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; at the 62-minute mark. There are spoilers, so listeners pay attention for the warning!&lt;/p&gt;

Going for more of a free-form episode because of the slow news week, the duo focus mostly on various topics in the gaming world. Starting off with the unboxing of the Ogre board game and its aircraft carrier sized box and board game piles of shame, the team talks about PAX South, gaming news including Gearbox&amp;#8217;s Battleborn, the 2K Humble Bundle and gaming sales for classic games, animation and the Robotech Kickstarter, the ethics of a minimum payment for Humble Bundle codes, games purchased during the Steam sale, issues with Humble Bundle activations for Emdee and the changing tide of the game publishing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;#8217;s episode of 20 Sides of Nerd, Emdee and Draeno welcome Justin Korthof (SixOkay) of &lt;a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/"&gt;Robot Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; for a return visit to the show. As Justin is the community manager for the company, the team spends some time talking about Robot&amp;#8217;s next iteration of the &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die!&lt;/em&gt; series, &lt;a href="https://www.orcsmustdie.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die! Unchained&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The team talks about some of the differences in the game from the previous ones, including some multiplayer mayhem. Afterward, the Aereo Supreme Court decision is debated before moving into the area of comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into some passionate territory, the future of the DC Universe is talked about, including Batman vs. Superman, Fox&amp;#8217;s Gotham, the New 52 comics, the future of films with Warner Brothers and how a fan could see them going. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a comic&amp;#8217;s discussion if they didn&amp;#8217;t talk about the effect on digital comics the change in Comixology&amp;#8217;s ownership will have. Make sure to check out SixOkay&amp;#8217;s post on &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.sixokay.com/2013/11/23/man-of-steel-isnt-about-superman/"&gt;Man of Steel isn&amp;#8217;t about Superman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; for some reference.&lt;/p&gt;

Forgoing the usual nerd and news talk of the week, everyone jumps on board to talk about the news in Sirlin&amp;#8217;s world. Since Sirlin&amp;#8217;s last appearance as a guest on the cast, he&amp;#8217;s has shipped a new gambling game called Pandante. His biggest game, Yomi, has also made its way to &lt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yomi/id594630025?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Delving into the happenings of the last two years, the team talks game development and the problems it faces, the challenges of balancing, how Sirlin got his start in games, some talk on Hearthstone, Kickstarter and the mentality around it, and much more. Fans of Sirlin&amp;#8217;s work will be happy to hear that there is some news and development insight on Codex in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget to check out Sirlin&amp;#8217;s latest Kickstarter, a new run and expansions for the &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sirlin/yomi"&gt;physical version of Yomi&lt;/a&gt;!

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;#8217;s episode of 20 Sides of Nerd, Emdee and Draeno make some discoveries that could haunt the automotive industry for some time to come. For that, they wish to say they are very sorry for the pain they have inflicted on car buyers in the future. Outside of allowing DLC practices or Project $10 coming to your next compact car, the team covers component swaps in Kingston and PNY solid state drives, Emdee&amp;#8217;s Orge purchase, the perks of getting large review shipments, E3, the idea of Nintendo moving away from consoles, Amazon&amp;#8217;s Fire Phone, Steam&amp;#8217;s Summer Sale, the Far Cry series, Apple&amp;#8217;s new inexpensive iMac, T-Mobile&amp;#8217;s announcements and issues, the end of Cosmos, and some other smaller topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as they should, the team closes with another apology for the money you&amp;#8217;ll end up paying to automotive corporate overlords to drive cars.&lt;/p&gt;

A pile of odd topics was gathered before the podcast hosts this week, marking yet another banner week in the sphere of nerd interests. Topics for the week include the rumor of Apple&amp;#8217;s purchase of Beats Audio, Amazon&amp;#8217;s patent award for photography against a white background, commentary on the Samsung Galaxy S5 which includes a recent poll from Korea, FCC commissioners voices concerns of net neutrality proposal, Google cuddling with the NSA, Mediabridge threatening legal action against an Amazon reviewer, the reality of aging harder, recent cancellations and renewals of television shows including some time on Rockne S. O&amp;#8217;Bannon creations and some brief talk on Bungie and the cost of Destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

While things a little more low key on the cast this week, Draeno and Emdee take a spirited go of the highlights of the week. Things they talk about include some of the happenings with the Apple versus Samsung verdict, Amazon changing &lt;a href="https://www.comixology.com/"&gt;Comixology&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; in-app purchases on iOS, Star Wars casting and casting bias, ex-Google employee states AdSense funds being pocketed instead of paying out, confirmation of the Atari ET game burial, brief talk on programming languages, the new Call of Duty announcement, Oculus VR&amp;#8217;s fight against ZeniMax over VR work done by John Carmack, and some talk of  actors in genre television and recent cancellations. Look forward to the next cast early this week!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nerd rage abound! This week on the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast Draeno and Emdee are joined by Charles from the Doctor Who podcast &lt;a href="http://thehappinesspatrol.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Happiness Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.crustyoldwave.com/"&gt;Chas&amp;#8217; Crusty Old Wave!&lt;/a&gt; podcast. In full swing about the recent news over the treatment of the Star Wars Extended Universe, the team goes on at length about the impact the change will have on the world going forward before falling down a black hole of other Star Wars. Other topics for the case include a short conversation about Brannon Braga that sparks more conversation on Cosmos, sciences and the metric system, more on Apple versus Samsung, Aereo and forgetting laws, some crazy things going on in America, the changes in media consumption, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, crazy talented people with money issues and Xbox One looking towards Halo for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

Gox and cryptocurrency, Google quarterly results and the craziness of how people indicate financial disappointment, Draeno&amp;#8217;s experience with the Samsung Galaxy S5, more on Apple vs. Samsung, and what the team is doing in their spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Another week in the books with Draeno and Emdee on the 20 Sides of Nerd Podcast. The team talks about some of the events surrounding bathrooms at PAX East 2014, MMOs including Wildstar and Elder Scrolls Online, some of the perks of next generation consoles, Condoleezza Rice joining the Dropbox board, Charter Cable&amp;#8217;s bid on Time Warner Cable, Windows XP support being discontinued except in China and the United Kingdom, the trend in mobile operating systems and generations, Sim City 4 for Mac, Cosmos and the Borderlands pre-sequel. The guys talk a little about what they have going on what and what they are playing recently as well.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on 20 Sides of Nerd the team is joined by The Quantum Cat as the tackle the issues in tech and geekdom. Topics include a child exposing Xbox Live vulnerabilities, the end of Gamespy servers, a short branch out into the past of online gaming services, Draeno talks about his time at Emerald City Comic Con 2014, another round of Apple/Samsung lawsuits, Kindle Fire TV, Metacritic on Amazon, Titanfall on 360, PC game demands and indie games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew spends a good chunk of time on the Brendan Eich and the Mozilla CEO debacle. It is a touchy subject sure, but braving it is important for both Internet culture and geeks worldwide. Thus, 20 Sides of Nerd needed to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Welcome a new podcast this week as Draeno and Emdee keep the streak alive! The duo talk about the audacity of Mark Zuckerberg talking to the President of the United States over privacy concerns, Titanfall on OSX, Simcity and DRM concerns, age and changing gaming habits, the trouble with game advertising especially on Crunchyroll, television renewals and remakes, Cosmos, Draeno&amp;#8217;s experience with the new Evil Dead film in theaters, Apple wanting $20 per Samsung phone, the trouble with lawsuits becoming fiscal policy for corporations, Comcast, Target, and some other topics that bring out the grumpy in the pair. The cast gets a little into the &amp;#8220;get off my porch&amp;#8221; territory and a little into politics, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be 20 Sides of Nerd without at least some grumpy nerd talk. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week Draeno and Emdee tackle the odd issues again. The team talks a little about the latest Community episode which spins off into a brief touch on Scud: The Disposable Assassin before trailing off into older science fiction and the current state of science fiction shows including the new developments regarding the production of Neil Gaiman&amp;#8217;s American Gods. Emdee goes over his current re-watch of Battlestar Galactica which leads the guys trying to figure out what work the crew has done since the show ended. Draeno speaks a little on anime Kill la Kill which is turning into one of his favorites. Other topics include Star Wars: Clone Wars, the departure of Jack Trenton from Sony Entertainment, Titanfall, the proposed Halo 2 update, Mini Metro, the Delta Six Controller, a return to Dr. Who internet outrage, and Draeno gets lost in a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Draeno and Emdee are back for season three of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast! It&amp;#8217;s been awhile, so there has been a bunch of things that have happened since our last recording over a year ago. Expect some of the same banter, antics, and complaints as before as we continue to talk about all things nerdy. The guys hit the gamut of topics trying to catch up on some of the things that have been happening. Topics for the cast include Titanfall, Samsung vs. Apple, the economy of indie sales, Candy Crush, All New Marvel Now, digital books, Dungeons &amp;#038; Dragons, Project Ara, Netflix, and much more. Seriously, they talk about a bunch of different things. Welcome them back to a new wave of podcasts!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>Draeno and Emdee are back for season three of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast! It’s been awhile, so there has been a bunch of things that have happened since our last recording over a year ago. Expect some of the same banter, antics, and complaints as before as we continue to talk about all things nerdy. The guys hit the gamut of topics trying to catch up on some of the things that have been happening. Topics for the cast include Titanfall, Samsung vs. Apple, the economy of indie sales, Candy Crush, All New Marvel Now, digital books, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Project Ara, Netflix, and much more. Seriously, they talk about a bunch of different things. Welcome them back to a new wave of podcasts!</itunes:summary>

Even better, it was someone that was right in their wheelhouse. Author &lt;a href="http://alexirvine.blogspot.com"&gt;Alexander Irvine&lt;/a&gt; was gracious enough to join Draeno and Emdee this week to talk about a laundry list of topics. The group talked about what it is like to be a writer, how does someone handle being handed the keys to a popular TV franchise, what it is like to work on comic books, and much more. While the episode was recorded some time ago, it is still worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rumors started circulationg earlier last month when The Hollywood Reporter announced that the Russo Brothers were in the final stages of negotiations to take the reigns of the &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; sequel. The sequel due in theatres April 2014 will pick up its story with Chris Evans reprising his role of citizen turned super soldier Steve Rogers in a modern day setting. Marvel has had a tough time nailing down directors for their upcoming projects &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thor 2&lt;/em&gt;, but thought that the Russos were the right team for this job. Marvel did have another pair of directors in Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the pair responsible for the &lt;em&gt;Crank&lt;/em&gt; series, &lt;em&gt;Gamer&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Jonah Hex&lt;/em&gt;) on the Columbia Pictures &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&lt;/em&gt;, so you can see why there may be some hesitation by critics of accepting the Russos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there shouldn’t be cause for concern. While there probably aren’t many people that are clued in to just what the Russo brothers are responsible, I assure you that they are some projects that make for a good pedigree. Their only film directing credit may be for &lt;em&gt;You, Me, &amp;#038; Dupree&lt;/em&gt;, but their television background is what needs to be looked at for consideration. The most notable of which is directing for shows such as &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Arrested Development&lt;/em&gt;. If those series don’t convince you that &lt;em&gt;Captain America 2&lt;/em&gt; is in good hands, I don’t think that anything will.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t think the slasher genre of horror films was dead, you most certainly will now. Michael Ausiello of TV Line is reporting that MTV has gained the rights to turn Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson’s reinvigorating film series &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; into a weekly scripted series for the network. While nothing has been said about what direction the show is going to take, as it has yet to find its writer, there are many questions about how the show will translate to a television audience given the content of the films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly holding out hope for &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; to turn into a decent television show in the hands of MTV. The network may have success with the re-envisioning of &lt;em&gt;Teen Wolf&lt;/em&gt;, but it definitely isn’t a show for everyone. Even though Williamson created a solid script and characters for the film to work with, I have to hold onto hope that MTV won’t involve him in anyway. Given that Williamson has been a producer and writers for teen hormone oozing shows like &lt;em&gt;Dawson’s Creek&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Vampire Diaries&lt;/em&gt;, this isn’t a show that I’ll be waiting by my TV to see if they do give him a call.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At least it appears that &lt;a href="http://www.syfy.com"&gt;Syfy&lt;/a&gt; is keeping some of its scripted television around, even if it is a show that they don’t actually produce themselves. Earlier this month the cable channel announced that it was renewing the broadcast rights for the supernatural crime drama, &lt;em&gt;Lost Girl&lt;/em&gt;, for its 13 episode third season. The announcement had been made months prior by the Canadian company Showcase, causing Syfy to hold out until it was clear the next season was in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with &lt;em&gt;Lost Girl&lt;/em&gt;, it revolves around Bo, a succubus that discovers that she feeds off the life force of others, or more pointedly, their sexual energy. As one would guess, this is a struggle as the world of who she thought she was clashes with who she will become. Unaware of her powers at a young age, she now has to cope with being identified as a Fae. She becomes entangled in an underground world as she tries to figure out who she is and what her place is in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syfy is moving the show from Mondays at 10:00PM to the same time slot on Friday when the show returns on July 20th. It is unclear why the move was made to the Friday night death slot, especially when it had a 1.64 million viewer average from the second season. Hopefully this wasn’t done with the intent of killing off yet another scripted show to replace it with more reality shows. Time will tell though.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It appears that Ubisoft isn’t messing around when it comes to bringing &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; to the big screen. After a lengthy shopping process for the franchise that would grant Ubisoft an unprecedented amount of control, Sony finally ended up in negotiations with the gaming studio to develop the title. However, it looks like it may end up handled solely by Ubisoft Motion Pictures. Better yet, the actor slated to play Desmond/Altair/Ezio will have a hand in producing the film as well through his company DMC Film Ltd. Who is it that is going to play our genetic memory assassin? None other than current Hollywood hot shot, Michael Fassbender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Julien Baronnet, CEO of Ubisoft Motion Pictures, confirmed that “Michael Fassbender was our first choice” in an interview with &lt;a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118056333"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Michael (Fassbender) is an extremely smart, talented, versatile and committed actor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truer words could not be spoken when you look at his range of films from &lt;em&gt;X-Men: First Class&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way you look at it, an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; marks a major development for the gaming studio turned large scale entertainment producer. &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt; has a diehard following that could easily make or break the franchise with a feature film. Ubisoft has had a property turn sour after a flop on the silver screen. Even with the series creator, Jordan Mechner, penning the story for the film. Ubisoft looks to avoid this by securing outside financing to help the startup picture studio keep creative control on the film rather than having the film studio twist it to their desires. As this was the plan all along, it gives hope that finally we may have a good video game adaptation to film. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you were paying attention to some of the announcements coming out of E3, you might already know that PowerA was developing cases for the iPhone 4/4S that might have caught your geeky eye. The first wave in a limited series of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; inspired cases have been launched from the vendor &lt;a href="http://www.powera.com/StarWars"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, and are set to be available through Best Buy on July 22nd. With four now available, two from the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Collector Case Series and two from the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Saga Cases collections, it is going to be interesting to see how this series pans out both in sales and durability. The hair on the Chewbacca Collector Case Series does certainly raise a bunch of questions on a phone case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to  John Moore, vice presedent of product development and marketing for PowerA, &amp;#8220;These are indeed the iPhone cases you are looking for.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the cases have been officially announced in the series, but pictures surfacing from E3 would lead us to believe that the Collector Case Series will round out with C-3PO and Darth Vader versions. The Saga Cases collection is only limited to the droids and &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt; poster art at this time, but it seems like more will be coming our way. To the development team for PowerA, I&amp;#8217;ll make a quick suggestion. If you are planning to be Jar Jar Binks on any of the cases, you better make it a ruggedized version. Many a iPhone will be thrown in rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/powerastarwars002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/powerastarwars002.jpg" alt="PowerA, Star Wars, poster, droids, Chewbacca, R2-D2, iphone, cases, 4, 4S" title="powerastarwars002" width="505" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case securely snaps into place. No Force powers required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limited edition case fit for the most avid Star Wars collector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look closely to see the engraved details in this premium case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chewbacca fur keeps this case cozy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officially licensed &lt;em&gt;Star Wars™&lt;/em&gt; product developed by PowerA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone sold separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What would a &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; film be without a game being released as a merchandising tie right before its debut? As &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on July 3rd, and the game coming out next week (June 26th), it comes as no surprise that some more details would come out to whet the pallet of potential fans. I think Beenox and Activision hit it big with the release of the newest behind the scenes trailer of the game. This new video features the voice behind the boastful tutor and challenge setter, The Extreme Reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Extreme Reporter, Campbell returns to a role similar to the ones he provided for the game spin-offs from the Sam Raimi directed trilogy of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films starring Toby Maguire. Campbell brings back his signature comedic styling that taunted the previous incarnation of Peter Parker. From the skies the reporter, a former MMA fighter that gained his glory though trash talking his opponents according to Campbell, uses his attitude and mouth to set Spider-Man on various challenges and objectives throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Extreme Reporter is very similar to me in that it&amp;#8217;s the intelligence and the wit that is the same. So really we have a lot in common. We&amp;#8217;re really simple people that who don&amp;#8217;t think that highly of ourselves other than the fact that we&amp;#8217;re &lt;em&gt;awesome,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; says Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that Campbell would have been able to play another cameo part in Mark Webb&amp;#8217;s reboot of the series, but at least we see him return to a familiar role in the game. Don&amp;#8217;t forget to check out the film when it hit theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we go again. &lt;a href="http://www.syfy.com"&gt;Syfy&lt;/a&gt; has cancelled yet another one of their scripted television series. After four seasons with the network, &lt;em&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/em&gt; has been put to an end by the genre favorite network. This is an announcement that I’m sure really didn’t come as a shock to anyone, especially if you&amp;#8217;ve been following how the network has been treating the show since bringing the show to the network from its first home on the web. According to TV by the Numbers, the show has been averaging a 0.4 viewership average in adults 18-49 since it returned in the fall. Given how low that is for the cable network, even on a Friday, you can imagine that this was along time coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://20sidesofnerd.com/news/no-renewal-for-sanctuary/attachment/syfy-tweet/" rel="attachment wp-att-911"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/syfy-tweet.jpg" alt="" title="syfy-tweet" width="554" height="204" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were hoping that the show was going to get a wrap up after the ending of season four, I&amp;#8217;m sorry to disappoint you. Given the low ratings share, I doubt that even an aggressive fan campaign would bring a favorable outcome. I guess all we can hope for is for &lt;em&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/em&gt; to return to the web to bring a conclusion to the series. Sad day for sure given the advances this show provided for CGI filming.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Recently, one of my favorite comics has decided to take a different path in the type of content it releases. Since Brad Guigar's return from &lt;a href="http://www.emeraldcitycomiccon.com"&gt;Emerald City Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;, he has announced an experiment in which all of April's strips for &lt;a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased before the strips run their course. While Guigar is known to work far ahead in his work, partially due to newspaper time frames, this foray into a new aspect of the online comic model pushes him to work even further in the future. Mr. Guigar was kind enough to take some time out of his busy schedule to sit down with me to answer a few questions.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of my favorite comics has decided to take a different path in the type of content it releases. Since Brad Guigar&amp;#8217;s return from &lt;a href="http://20sidesofnerd.com/video/eccc12-interview-with-brad-guigar/"&gt;Emerald City Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;, he has announced an experiment in which all of April&amp;#8217;s strips for &lt;a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be &lt;a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/forums/stains/9135/"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; before the strips run their course. Packaging this all up into a neat PDF (or MOBI for you Kindle users), the document features an arc of Dr. Muskiday running from April 2 to April 28. While Guigar is known to work far ahead in his work, partially due to newspaper time frames, this foray into a new aspect of the online comic model pushes him to work even further in the future. Mr. Guigar was kind enough to take some time out of his busy schedule to sit down with me to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for taking a moment to sit down with me, Brad. I know that you&amp;#8217;ve probably got your hands full right now. First I have to know, what stirred up the idea to sell a months worth of comics prior to posting them on the &lt;em&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/em&gt; website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I wanted to do for a long time. I wanted to offer a digital download, but offering stuff that was readily available on my site didn&amp;#8217;t seem to make sense. Neither did competing with my print book sales. I maintain a significant buffer &amp;#8212; partially out of the necessity of giving Ed Ryzowski time to color the strips, and partially out of wanting to make sure that the comic isn&amp;#8217;t interrupted by unforeseen events. So it kinda dawned on me that this might be a fun thing to experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; How did Ed (colorist Ed Ryzowski) take the news when you told him the plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; Ed is unshakeable. He has a completely can-do, confident attitude. He&amp;#8217;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of workload has pushing out the strips this far ahead added to your plate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve been slowly building up this buffer for months now. The extra workload hasn&amp;#8217;t been huge. I just nibbled away at it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Was the $1.50 price an arbitrary number that you plucked out of the air or was there some logic to it? Does it go along with the idea of making it accessible, similar to selling buttons or stickers at a convention at a low price point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to make it low enough for an impulse buy without making it seem cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the response of your fans, is this something that you will keep doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; The response has been very strong. My goal is to release the May edition during the last week of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; You mentioned that you may raise the price to $2 or $3. Do you think that price range will still be in that area? Even with it being a similar price to picking up a comic issue at your local shop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; I think $2-3 is the sweet spot for digital downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you think this will have a negative or a positive effect on your book sales?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t think it will have any effect on my book sales. The books have a completely unique hook. They&amp;#8217;re graphic novels based on the daily strip. I use the individual panels of the daily comics to lay out a graphic novel. And where I have always used narration boxes and panels that were not part of the original Web presentation to smooth out the storytelling, the next &lt;em&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/em&gt; book is going to raise that experience to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Would you say there has been a difference in net traffic of ad revenue over the previous month by creating an avenue for fans to read the story instead of visiting the site daily?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; This has had no discernible effect on traffic or ad revenue. Both have stayed at their regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you thought of using this as a way to arrange gift copies to other people that may not be regularly able to read the strips? For instance, military personnel stationed in various areas, people in lands without stable internet, hermits in caves with iPads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but that&amp;#8217;s a dandy idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; In creating a digital file for distribution, do you worry about potential piracy issues? I know that it isn&amp;#8217;t a big issue since the comics are posted online to begin with. There is that small window where you may miss out on some revenue though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#8217;s always a worry, but I didn&amp;#8217;t want that to keep me from trying this idea out. To a large extent, I trust my readers. They&amp;#8217;ve been incredibly supportive of me for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno&lt;/strong&gt;: You mentioned in your announcement that you were excluding the Saturday strips. Since you do these strips &amp;#8220;on the fly,&amp;#8221; as you put it, for the newspapers do you have any future plans for them as a separate release?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#8217;re full of great ideas, aren&amp;#8217;t you? &lt;img src="http://20sidesofnerd.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /&gt;  I just might!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, are they any numbers thus far that you could share up to this point? I think people are curious about how successful this has been. I know I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; I never share numbers. It&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m secretive. It&amp;#8217;s just that there&amp;#8217;s no real context for numbers in a case like this. No matter what number I give you, one person could say, &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s astounding,&amp;#8221; and the next person could say, &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s not a third of what I thought it would be.&amp;#8221; And there&amp;#8217;s no way to prove either one of those people right or wrong. So I&amp;#8217;d rather not talk numbers. The response was strong enough for me to commit to a May release by the end of the first day. And surprisingly, as of ten days into the month, people are still downloading the April issue. That&amp;#8217;s a very positive response to this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;d like to thank you Brad for taking the time out of your schedule to answer a few questions. I know that putting out a product like this for &lt;em&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/em&gt; will do more for keeping readers like me able to catch up on big chunks of story amidst our busy live. I really hope that everything goes as well, if not better, than planned with this next step on getting &lt;strong&gt;Evil Inc.&lt;/strong&gt; out there. Just don&amp;#8217;t kill Ed, OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks again for the opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://20sidesofnerd.com/blog/getting-ahead-of-evil-inc/attachment/evil-inc-digital002/" rel="attachment wp-att-888"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Evil-Inc-Digital002.jpg" alt="Evil Inc., interview, Brad Guigar, comics, digial downloads" title="Evil-Inc-Digital002" width="500" height="293" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the project did end up being enough of a success for Brad to put out &lt;a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/forums/stains/9166/"&gt;May&amp;#8217;s edition&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April. I&amp;#8217;m excited and interested to see how this trend goes into the future. The price is so low, that it is perfect for the impulse buy as he had intended. Better yet, with the May edition he only bumped the price point up $0.50. Hopefully, Brad will be able to keep pushing these monthly volumes out as time goes on. Given how naturally far ahead he works, I don&amp;#8217;t see how keeping up will be a problem. When you consider how this has become a full time job recently, it makes you want it to succeed that much more. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Hey, remember these guys?  If you don't remember the team, they're the head nerds at the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast. Contrary to public opinion, Emdee and Draeno aren't not dead, nor retired. They are just busy in real life! Join them for the regular insanity. They discussed Halo 4's launch date, a discussion about what they know about it (which isn't much), small nuclear reactors and why they are heartily approved, &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; upcoming comics, Fringe (before we knew it was renewed), mandatory car black box incident reporting, and 80's musician-hosted reality programming.</description>

Through a truly unfortunate sequence of events transpired and he was able to cast. The bonus is that now he gets to tell everyone about the events that stopped him from attending on the biggest conventions of the year in this 11th episode of the season. In more on topic matters, the podcast covers &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3's&lt;/em&gt; ending and the possible future of the franchise, EA being the worst company on the planet, airline scheduling snafus, &lt;em&gt;Super Monday Night Combat&lt;/em&gt; and other normal randomness.</description>

To hell with him then! Instead, Emdee brought Snorkle aboard from the &lt;a href="http://www.geek-republic.com/"&gt;Geek-Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Dragging him from a back back alley, a bag was put over his head to smuggle him into the 20SON studios to record this week's Draeno-free podcast. Together they talk about Best Buy's collapse, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;'s ending and why it's really not an issue, genre TV, and a couple of other random topics.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Draeno will be back either during or after PAX, don&amp;#8217;t worry. It&amp;#8217;s just not the same without him.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few folks have been asking lately, &amp;#8220;Where&amp;#8217;s the podcast?&amp;#8221; Currently Emdee has been tied up in some real life matters that he has been unable to pull himself away from. Due to this, we haven&amp;#8217;t been able to record a new cast. Fear not though, we will return once he gets all of that squared away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, Draeno will be attending Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle this weekend! If you see a guy with a bunny around his neck, feel free to say hello! He will be onsite conducting interviews and other footage while attending the con. Won&amp;#8217;t be able to catch him there? Don&amp;#8217;t worry. He&amp;#8217;ll be at PAX East 2012 the following weekend with Front Towards Gamer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, you smell that in the air? It&amp;#8217;s convention season!&lt;/p&gt;

The next wave of performance enhancements for serious console gamers is always sitting on the horizon. Some companies create useful products that can be used every day, while others craft questionable attachments that leave people scratching their heads. The market is a mixed bag of random ideas that are thrown out there to see what sticks. Most hit the market place dead on arrival, but a few gems pop up from time to time that have consumers questioning if they are worth their gaming buck. &lt;a href=" http://www.kontrolfreek.com/"&gt;Kontrol Freek&lt;/a&gt; came out with a series of thumb stick extensions for various game types that had me pondering if they were worth taking a look at. Considering the fact that their products have a bit of science behind them makes it worth investigating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-771"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_777" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-006/" rel="attachment wp-att-777"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-006-e1331154084596.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-006" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-777" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Simple aren&amp;#039;t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kontrolfreek.com/FPS/KontrolFreek-FPS-Freek.asp"&gt;The FPS Freeks&lt;/a&gt; claim to have a 40 degree increase in &lt;a href="http://www.kontrolfreek.com/The-Science.asp"&gt;range movement&lt;/a&gt;. Kontrol Freek says that this improvement offers the “closest feel to a mouse possible on a console without an internal controller mod or cheat.” There is logic behind the statement. If you think about the extension of the analog sticks, the length allows for smaller movements in the controls versus the shorter throw of the standard controller&amp;#8217;s sticks. In comparison to the standard stick, these micro movements can give the player a feeling of fine tuning their aiming. This can result in fewer missed opportunities from overshooting the targets by simply putting too much pressure into the move. This improvement is done in a way that keeps them still legal in tournament settings like the &lt;a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/"&gt;MLG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_772" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-001/" rel="attachment wp-att-772"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-001-e1331154824791.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-001" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-772" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There isn&amp;#039;t much take away from the natural grip of the Xbox controller. From a distance you would just think they were a natural part of the construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimalist packaging houses the two extenders that use their joined snaps to anchor them to a plastic card. Pulling them from the package you find that they are fairly light weight. In theory this shouldn’t affect the balance of the Xbox controller, nor one that of the lighter battery pack free PS3 controller. Inspecting the extensions closer you can plainly see that the pieces are injected molded plastic, with a rubberized coating on the head. Small bumps appear at the top offering a reference for your skin to grab onto in the concave dome shape your thumb will rest in much the same way that the bumps on the F and J key provide a reference for finding the home position for typing. The head feels a bit more comfortable on the thumbs than the standard rubber on the Xbox controller. Moving down you see the feet or snaps that would be placed on the analog stick of your choice. These little feet grab onto the head of your analog stick on your controller and wrap around underneath to secure themselves.* They can require a bit of force to pop on if you try to mount them straight on. I found it was easier to sit part of the adapter on one side and tilt it to force on fewer points at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_776" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-005/" rel="attachment wp-att-776"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-005-e1331154868133.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-005" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-776" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The extenders don&amp;#039;t add on as much height as one might think. As you can see in comparison, there isn&amp;#039;t really much gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is, “Are the FPS Freeks practical?” Indeed, they are. They offer a little more comfort to a player’s hand without putting your thumbs too far away from a standard configuration. More than that, they aren’t some gadget of the month type of doo hickey that adds unnecessary clutter to an already crammed playing space. They are easy to install and even easier to use. How much performance is gained is an altogether different question. The gains from either end of the spectrum (casual to hardcore) will be very different. A casual player might find that he or she is able to tolerate playing shooters for a little longer. The enhanced gaming endurance is not only due to the reduction of thumb fatigue thanks to the now shorter moving distances with less hunting for the sweet spot, but also because from a lesser feeling of frustration. Hopefully it will help eliminate the slow panning movements that often plague the unfamiliar or ‘sometimes’ player. For seasoned, “All I do is play X game every day, all day” type of players, they can easily benefit from the quicker snaps to aiming. Focusing on the tighter scoped shots become much more of a twitch reaction than a conscious movement. Even the trivial task of movement was made easier, leading to more fluid motions and quicker turn arounds. I found myself somewhere in the middle, as my hands aren’t conditioned from hours upon hours of player per day. However, my PC experience kicked in with higher sensitivity levels I was able to set to because of the increased leverage of the Freeks. Either way the learning curve isn’t huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the Freeks through vigorous testing in both &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt; was definitely a different experience than normal. Not so much as it was when I did &lt;a href="http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2012/01/22/ftg-nerd-review-penguin-uniteds-eagle-eye-converter-for-xbox360/"&gt;my review of the Eagle Eye&lt;/a&gt;, but different enough that it took a little bit of time to get used to. It felt incredibly easier to actually aim for my target in each of these games. &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; saw a larger benefit as the game itself no longer felt like a slug traveling across my TV when I tried to gun someone down but it still wasn’t the natural mouse feeling that I’m used to. The nubs provided a better adjustment than the &lt;a href="http://www.penguinunitedstore.com/eagle-eye-converter-3-0-for-xbox360/"&gt;Eagle Eye&lt;/a&gt; did as well. Where with the converter box I had to max out all sensitivities, &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; still allowed me some leeway this time around. &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; only felt like a slight improvement. I found myself stopping and changing the sensitivity often as I couldn’t find a good balance between the run and gun and the hide mechanic. Though, I could tolerate the Retro Lancer a little better with than without the Freeks. I did notice that panning from side to side was improved as I could pick off incoming hordes a little quicker. Shifting up and down to focusing on those shooting above at distance was a slicker experience as well. I would like to think that there was improvement in my game, but there was no quantifiable statistics other than I won a few games in Reach (which rarely happens outside of team play) and I was actually able to enjoy &lt;em&gt;GoW3&lt;/em&gt; instead of bitching at the mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_781" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-010/" rel="attachment wp-att-781"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-010-e1331154899442.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-010" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-781" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The arms pictured here give an example of the concern with the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the good the adapters do in games, they have some problems outside of them. The biggest issue is the polish of the units themselves. Small sprue remnants can be seen along the diameter of the head and plastic base from the molding procedure. The seams from the mold halves coming together are also predominately visible when looking at them. While the seams don’t bother me much in the final product, the little remnant bits could have been cleaned off a bit better before leaving the assembly line. The rubber coating seems to have an inconsistent joint with the plastic base as well, causing some places of them to not evenly meet up. At the place where the rubber coating and plastic meet, there are uneven bits. The molded feed or snaps are also a point of concern in regards to overall longevity of the parts. Each one of the addons I received were different in one way or another. Extra bits hung on, pieces seemed to be cut off in error. One of them I even wondered about the structural integrity. It just looked as if it was going to snap when I put it on. Thankfully it has survived multiple on/off scenarios. I must voice my annoyance at using the Freeks while doing normal tasks on the Xbox as well. Using them for navigating applications like &lt;a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiHome"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; feels a little awkward. Fixing that is done by popping them off or using Kinect Voice navigation though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_782" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-011/" rel="attachment wp-att-782"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-011-e1331154939991.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-011" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-782" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Oh yes, I broke out the micrometer. Thickness of the rounded head came in at 0.8 and 0.792. Height was measured at 0.437 and 0.444, excluding the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, brace yourself for the cost. Models start at $9.99 before rolling up to $13.99 if you buy them straight from the company. Better yet, those are the best prices you can get on them. Free shipping enters the room at a certain price point, so it does make it worth it to look at their other products. Kontrol Freek does offer different styles and limited releases for their FPS line of extensions if you are into changing the look or feel. If you don’t like the concave feel of the standard models that feature the Xbox styling, don’t worry. There are some FPS models that have been made to mimic the dome shape that PS3 players would be familiar with. In addition to the changes to the base structures, shapes in tribute to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; have been used in the past as grip points for the nodules. They even make shorter attachments marketed as the CQC model. The company’s website even offers bundles of various kinds of the Freeks, causing the price to dip further if you were considering getting some for different titles or even mixing and matching sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_773" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fps-freeks/attachment/freeks-002/" rel="attachment wp-att-773"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Freeks-002-e1331154967603.jpg" alt="Kontrol Freek, FPS Freeks, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, controllers, extensions, Xbox, PS3" title="Freeks-002" width="500" height="333" class="size-full wp-image-773" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;They look damn sexy on those Reach controllers, don&amp;#039;t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some quality time with these little nubs of plastic, I have to say that Kontrol Freek makes a solid product. I can’t firmly confirm the science that they claim with the motion range, but at face value any average person can see that there is some level of truth to it. My only wish was that the company spent a little more time on the finish of their products. The uneven joints and inconsistencies of the molded feet turn me off a little. For a flagship product, I’d want to put some pride into each any every piece that goes out the door. This letdown doesn’t kill the product for me though. You simply can’t ignore the fact they work, and they work well. For the cost, even having to replace these every six months still factors in at a good value for the improvements they’ll make to your game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*It’s worth noting that the FPS Freeks don’t attach to the &lt;a href="http://www.razerzone.com/minisite/onza"&gt;Razer Onza&lt;/a&gt; because of the resistance dials on the Onza.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>To nobody's surprise, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced the new iPad. Note that it's not the iPad 3, nor the iPad HD, or any InterCap variation of same. It's just the iPad. With a new technological iteration comes some improvements to the base device. My issue as it has always been is will the promises and marketing speak live up to the hype, and what's the reality behind the raw numbers.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-analysis-3rd-generation-ipad-announcement/attachment/resolutionary/" rel="attachment wp-att-785"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/resolutionary.jpg" alt="" title="resolutionary" width="700" height="453" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To nobody&amp;#8217;s surprise, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced the new iPad. Note that it&amp;#8217;s not the iPad 3, nor the iPad HD, or any InterCap variation of same. It&amp;#8217;s just the iPad. With a new technological iteration comes some improvements to the base device. My issue as it has always been is will the promises and marketing speak live up to the hype, and what&amp;#8217;s the reality behind the raw numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-784"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Retina Display&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While I&amp;#8217;m not sure I buy the grandiose claims of indistinguishable pixels made by Apple when touting their retina display, I do agree that they are very nice displays. At 2048 by 1536 pixels, Apple made a big deal pointing out that it was more pixels being pushed than on a 1080p television that many of us have sitting on our entertainment centers. While I&amp;#8217;m pleased about this generally, and I feel that it will greatly enhance marathon eBook and PDF reading sessions, I&amp;#8217;m not convinced it&amp;#8217;s a good thing all around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re now in a situation where developers have the choice of supporting four different resolutions, depending on what devices they wish to fully support. Original iPhones through the 3gs have displays running 480&amp;#215;328. The iPhone 4 and 4s are 960&amp;#215;640. The original iPad and iPad 2 are 1024&amp;#215;768 displays, and now the 3rd generation iPad sports the previously mentioned 2048 by 1536 pixel density. To accommodate the screen doubling feature so iPads can run iPhone specific apps, iPhone developers have to support 328&amp;#215;480 displays. So-called universal applications support at least 480&amp;#215;328 and the iPad&amp;#8217;s native 1024&amp;#215;768. Retina display utilization on the iPhone 4 or 4s add a third resolution. What are we going to call support of a 3rd generation iPad&amp;#8217;s much higher resolution? I feel that fragmentation of the app store is going to get worse, not better, with this. The 2012 iPad does in fact use the retina display graphics if available for resolution doubling of iPhone only applications. A side effect of the higher resolution on the new iPad is app size increasing. While vectorized text and PDFs won&amp;#8217;t get any bigger to support the higher resolution, graphical assets that can&amp;#8217;t be mathematically scaled will increase in size, and this in turn leads to larger app sizes. Given that the storage capacities on the iPad hasn&amp;#8217;t changed, this may prove to be a problem going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The camera on the back of the iPad is now a 1080p capable camera versus the 720p capable device in the 2nd generation iPad. As before, I think this is extra and not truly necessary. If it came down to having it versus not, and the price remaining the same, obviously, keep the camera. I just don&amp;#8217;t see where it&amp;#8217;s necessary in this class of device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The A5X processor&amp;#8217;s existence was leaked a few weeks before the event. Speculation was that it was still a dual core processor, just faster. In fact, Apple stated that the A5X is a quad core processor. It reality it may not be- there is some discussion that it&amp;#8217;s a dual core processor with a quad core graphical sub processor on die. With it brings a higher power demand, but Apple has managed to keep run time to 10 hours with the new iPad. Not every application will benefit from the 4 cores. In fact, most will see modest speed gains, if any. For sure, applications that need 3D acceleration for gaming will benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whither Siri?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the iPad has a dictation feature, I don&amp;#8217;t currently see any mention of Siri (the voice recognition and interpretation technology found on the iPhone 4S). The dictation feature may prove to be quite handy with journalists, but time will tell what applications will leverage this technology to it&amp;#8217;s fullest extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new iPad sports 4G wireless technology and some impressive benchmarks and demos were shown at the presentation. Two models supporting AT+T and Verizon will be available. I&amp;#8217;ve never had much of a use for even 3G on an iPad, as any kind of portable use I&amp;#8217;ve needed has been more than adequate on an iPhone, but different users have different needs. As always, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pending Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the event, an Apple employee stated that the iPad had &amp;#8220;more memory or screen resolution than either the xBox 360 or PS3.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;d like to think that this means that the iPad has a full gigabyte of application RAM, versus the 512 megabytes that the iPad 2 has. Breakdowns of the iPad by third parties has revealed 1 gigabyte of application RAM. I did wonder where Siri was in all this earlier, and that question stands. As an interesting aside, the iPad 2 will still be available in the product line at $399, putting a lot of pressure on the the other companies trying to make a tablet to successfully compete with the iPad. It will be interesting to see what this does to the tablet market as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay or Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just as with the iPhone 4S debacle, if you can call it that, this iPad revision is iterative, not revolutionary. More, faster, better. I&amp;#8217;m not sure there&amp;#8217;s a compelling reason to upgrade from an iPad 2 to a 3rd generation iPad, unless your eyes scream for mercy after reading e-books on the iPad 2 for a while. If you&amp;#8217;re in the market, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty impressive improvement over the original iPad. Should your budget trend a bit lower, the iPad 2 is still available new and I&amp;#8217;m sure there will be some fairly compelling deals on Craigslist before not very long on people itching to upgrade to the new shiny Apple-spawned tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>The Playstation Vita is Sony's answer to a question nobody asked. "Can we make a handheld console that provides a home console experience for gamers on the go?" Sony needs to convince the gaming public this is something they want, something they need. This is no small challenge, particularly with the Nintendo 3DS already entrenched in the dedicated handheld market and given the increasing prominence of smartphone/tablet gaming. 
</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/1-playstationvita/" rel="attachment wp-att-754"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/1-PlaystationVita.png" alt="" title="1-PlaystationVita" width="600" height="271" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Playstation Vita is Sony&amp;#8217;s answer to a question nobody asked. &amp;#8220;Can we make a handheld console that provides a home console experience for gamers on the go?&amp;#8221; Sony needs to convince the gaming public this is something they want, something they need. This is no small challenge, particularly with the Nintendo 3DS already entrenched in the dedicated handheld market and given the increasing prominence of smartphone/tablet gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-753"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony wants to appeal to the most hardcore of gamers, the casual market be damned. To this end, they&amp;#8217;ve assembled an impressive bit of hardware. It has just about every feature a gamer could ask for, and several no one asked for. It aims to be the most flexible console on the market, handheld or otherwise&amp;#8211;and it has done a fairly good job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable feature of the Vita is its size&amp;#8211;at 3.3 inches tall and 7.2 inches across, it is the largest handheld on the market. It achieves this size without significant bulk. At 0.73 inches, it is no thicker than a PSP-3000, and weighs a  little less than 10 ounces. It feels study and it&amp;#8217;s comfortable to hold, even through extended gaming sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_755" style="width: 497px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/2-size-comparison/" rel="attachment wp-att-755"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/2-Size-Comparison.jpg" alt="" title="2-Size Comparison" width="487" height="255" class="size-full wp-image-755" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Left to Right, iPhone 4/4S, Nintendo 3DS, PSP-3000, PS Vita&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this space is dedicated to its gorgeous 5 inch OLED capacitive multi-touch screen.  With a qHD resolution of 960 x 544, it boasts 220 pixels per inch. While it doesn&amp;#8217;t quite match the iPhone4&amp;#8242;s retina display (326 ppi), it is still crisp and detailed. The colors are rich and compared to it, the PSP and 3DS&amp;#8217;s displays look horribly pixellated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touch screen is responsive and accurate&amp;#8211;as good as any smart phone. The large amount of screen space helps offset the relative lack of precision from using fingers instead of a stylus. Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be oleophobic. Light fingerprints are largely invisible while the system is in use. However, a slight rainbow effect occurs on the heavier smudges over the course of an extended session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the touchscreen, the system boasts a wide array of control options.  It has the same basic control options as its predecessor&amp;#8211;a d-pad, 2 shoulder buttons, and 4 face buttons.  It also has a rear touchpad, six-axis motion sensing (3 axis gyrometer, 3 axis accelerometer),  a front camera, a rear camera, and most importantly&amp;#8211;dual thumb sticks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thumb sticks are small and squat, with the familiar convex tops and slightly rubberized surfaces. They&amp;#8217;re responsive and feel very natural, although I can&amp;#8217;t shake the feeling they&amp;#8217;re about to slip out from under my thumbs&amp;#8211;although they have yet to do so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rear touchpad is somewhat bewildering. I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure what it&amp;#8217;s for and I&amp;#8217;m not sure game developers know either. I&amp;#8217;ve yet to see an implementation in a game that wasn&amp;#8217;t completely shoe-horned in. Of course, I said something similar about the Nintendo DS&amp;#8217;s touch screen at first&amp;#8211;perhaps some inventive developer will rise to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-axis motion sensing is an interesting touch. While it&amp;#8217;s largely ignored and shoehorned in when it isn&amp;#8217;t, there are potentially useful applications for it. Its use in Uncharted: Golden Abyss bears special mention: you can move the system to shift the reticule. While this alone would be a horridly awkward way to go about aiming, it is superb in conjunction with the thumb sticks. Using the sticks to aim, then moving the system slightly to make fine adjustments quickly becomes second nature&amp;#8211;to the point you wonder how you got along without it before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cameras are 1.3 megapixels.  The Vita won&amp;#8217;t take the place of, well, anything when it comes to home photography. They&amp;#8217;re not without purpose, though. The back camera allows for &amp;#8220;Augmented Reality&amp;#8221; games, which use the real-life background as a backdrop for the game. The front camera features face detection and head tracking capabilities, although I&amp;#8217;ve yet to see a game that makes use of them.  Last, but not least, the conventional controls are comfortable and about what anyone familiar with a PSP would expect. It&amp;#8217;s worth noting the d-pad isn&amp;#8217;t as stiff and the face buttons are noticeably smaller when compared to the PSP&amp;#8217;s. The Vita also features Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth, microphone, stereo sound, a headphone jack, and slots for game cards and its proprietary storage. For $50 more, you can opt to have 3G in addition to Wi-Fi. It is worth noting the game cartridge compartment has a door that&amp;#8217;s infuriatingly difficult to jimmy open with short fingernails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_756" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/3-top/" rel="attachment wp-att-756"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/3-Top.jpg" alt="" title="3-Top" width="625" height="95" class="size-full wp-image-756" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Note the really small slots for port opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software&lt;br /&gt;
The Vita&amp;#8217;s interface is quick and clean. It eschews the XMB for a phone-like home screen&amp;#8211;it  displays 10 icons per page, which are only navigatable via the touch interface.  Swiping up and down navigates you through your installed apps, and swiping left and right cycles through your open applications. Whenever you insert a new game card, it &amp;#8220;installs&amp;#8221; the game, adding a new icon to the menu that persists even after the card is removed. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a list option, so the menu might get fairly bloated as one&amp;#8217;s library grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_757" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/4-icons/" rel="attachment wp-att-757"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/4-icons.jpg" alt="" title="4-icons" width="480" height="272" class="size-full wp-image-757" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;PS Vita home screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_758" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/5-active/" rel="attachment wp-att-758"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/5-active.jpg" alt="" title="5-active" width="480" height="272" class="size-full wp-image-758" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;	Pressing the PS button again from the home screen brings up a list of currently open apps, which you can also see as a small row of icons on the top margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vita has apps for most of the things you would expect on a portable handheld&amp;#8211;Friends list, PS Store, Trophies, Remote Play, Settings, etc. It also has apps you would commonly see on smartphones&amp;#8211;Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Maps, and a web browser. There are a few apps that warrant special mention. Unlike the PSP or PS3, the Playstation Vita supports both party voice chat and group messaging through PSN, via the Party and Group Messaging apps, respectively. While neither are mandatory additions, party chat is a godsend if you want to talk to friends (and only your friends) while playing online.  It also comes with a quirky app called Near, which shows you what people are playing nearby. I&amp;#8217;ve seen it extend out to about a mile around me, with their positions relative to where I am. At the time of writing, it has found 38 Vita owners within half a  mile of me. Never fear, if you desire privacy, you are not obliged to disclose your location or activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-playstation-vita/attachment/6-near/" rel="attachment wp-att-759"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/6-near.jpg" alt="Players local to the author." title="6-near" width="480" height="272" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a gaming system, through and through. While it makes a nod toward expanded functionality, it is merely a token effort&amp;#8211;there is no reason not to include those functions if the device can perform them.  While activities like Netflix and Twitter are perfectly pleasant using the Vita, it is not designed to be a smart phone replacement and is merely usable when it comes to web browsing. The virtual keyboard is nice, but it lacks an autocorrect function (for good or for ill)&amp;#8211;and personally, my hands are too small to conveniently reach the middle keys. Similarly, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t use the system for its music player, video player, or camera functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony has set out to create a console that can play almost any kind of game and they have succeeded admirably. From &amp;#8220;phone games&amp;#8221; to first person shooters, it can do it all. The importance of dual thumb sticks on this system cannot be overstated. It was a revolutionary concept when it came to home consoles, and it similarly expands the range of games available to the PS Vita&amp;#8211;essential when attempting to recreate the home console experience. The Vita is flexible and powerful, and successfully imparts the home console experience on the go.  Unfortunately, the Vita price point is also similar to home consoles- $250 for Wifi only or $300 with Wifi and 3G connectivity.  The proprietary memory is also prohibitively expensive, ranging from $20 for a 4GB card to a whopping $100 for a 32GB card. If you avoid downloading retail titles, you can probably get by with a 4GB or 8GB card. If you want a purely digital library, be prepared to pay dearly&amp;#8211;each retail game takes up 2-4GB. 3G service isn&amp;#8217;t free either&amp;#8211;the cheapest plan is $15 per month, with a cap of 250MB.  Overall, the Playstation Vita is a truly impressive piece of hardware with a lot of potential but with its price and added costs, will be a hard sell at these price points no matter how many shiny features it has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>In 2011, Amarillo Design Bureau and Majestic 12 games adapted the Starmada system to the Star Fleet Universe. We've already declared Starmada to be an excellent fleet and squad level starship combat system, but do the peculiars of the Star Fleet Universe translate well to the Starmada system?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-klingon-romulan-and-alien-armada/attachment/klingon-armada-cover/" rel="attachment wp-att-752"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Klingon-Armada-cover-e1330581003775.jpg" alt="" title="Klingon-Armada-cover" width="660" height="241" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; as a gaming system has a long and dramatic history. It&amp;#8217;s replete with licensing issues, deviations from Star Trek canon, supplier problems, player discontent, and a plethora of revisions. It&amp;#8217;s quite a tale, but through it all the complexity and detail of the system has remained. Complexity is simultaneously it&amp;#8217;s greatest strength and biggest weakness. &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent small scale engagement simulator, but even the most adept of players has a hard time fielding more than a small handful of ships. As such, large fleet actions are very difficult to orchestrate and play. Until recently, large fleet actions were only abstractable in &lt;em&gt;Federation and Empire&lt;/em&gt;, an operational level game involving entire empires and the fate of the galaxy in the balance. In 2011, Amarillo Design Bureau and Majestic 12 games adapted the &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; system to the Star Fleet Universe. We&amp;#8217;ve already declared &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; to be an excellent fleet and squad level starship combat system &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20-sides-of-nerd-review-starmada/" target="_blank"&gt;in this very website&lt;/a&gt;, but do the peculiars of the Star Fleet Universe translate well to the Starmada system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-749"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    We&amp;#8217;ve already &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20-sides-of-nerd-review-starmada/" target="_blank"&gt;thoroughly reviewed the Starmada system&lt;/a&gt;. In summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Starmada is just a wonderful game.The rules are easy to learn, the cost is extremely reasonable, and the only limit to how you play is how much time you want to invest. Games can take a little as an hour if you wanted an extremely casual game or days if you built up massive, customized fleets. Majestic 12 was even kind enough to give you all the printable resources you could need, in terms of play board, ships, and even tokens to keep track of your ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    As far as general mechanics go, very little has been added that wasn&amp;#8217;t already present in the &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; core book or rule annex. A couple of different &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; products have been harvested for &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; to bring you what you need to get started in the Star Fleet Universe. That&amp;#8217;s not to say that if you want to play in this particular universe that you shouldn&amp;#8217;t get &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; if you already have both books. There is a great deal of universe specific text with the ruleset that you won&amp;#8217;t have if you just have the core books. There are also about 40 Star Fleet Universe ships included per volume of the Armada series which you also wouldn&amp;#8217;t get with just the core &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; book. It is important to note that the &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; system has a significant departure from normal starship combat games. Power allocation is an important factor in the original source material, but in &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; as in &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; there is no power allocation phase. If it&amp;#8217;s installed on your ship and not damaged, you can use it. Power allocation for perhaps dozens of ships on one side would prove to be problematic and extraordinarily time consuming, so this isn&amp;#8217;t a flaw of the system. Rather it is a design choice and a nod towards simple and fast play rather than the epic level of detail found in other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_751" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-klingon-romulan-and-alien-armada/attachment/star-fleet-battles-training-module/" rel="attachment wp-att-751"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/star-fleet-battles-training-module-1024x744.jpg" alt="" title="star fleet battles training module" width="640" height="465" class="size-large wp-image-751" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is essentially the Enterprise from Star Fleet Battles, in it&amp;#039;s simplest form.  It&amp;#039;s normally a full 8.5 x 11 page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    There are four books in the Star Fleet Universe Armada series. The &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; book includes the Klingons, Federation, Tholians, Orions and Kzinti. &lt;em&gt;Romulan Armada&lt;/em&gt; includes more Federation ships, and adds the Romulans and Gorn to the play field. &lt;em&gt;Alien Armada&lt;/em&gt; includes more Tholians, more Orions, and adds the Neo-Tholians and Seltorians. &lt;em&gt;Distant Armada&lt;/em&gt; adds the Hydrans, WYN Cluster, Lyran Empire, and Lyran Democratic Republic. All of these books are stand alone and don&amp;#8217;t require any other products in the series to use. You could get just the &lt;em&gt;Distant Armada&lt;/em&gt; book if you were so inclined and still have a complete product with everything you need to play. If you&amp;#8217;re a Trek purist, many of these names are foreign to you. The variant of the Star Trek universe that &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; lives in diverged from the &amp;#8220;main&amp;#8221; Trek fictional universe at about the time of the original Star Trek movies. Licensing issues are a bitch sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; universe has a few different scales of play as I alluded to before. Strategic Level is handled by &lt;em&gt;Federation and Empire&lt;/em&gt;. Single and small number of unit skirmishes are best handled by &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; itself in ridiculous system level detail. One on one duels are best handled in &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Federation Commander&lt;/em&gt; has two scales which speeds play a bit at the expense of some detail. Small squads of ships are best handled in either scale of Federation Commander. The gap between &lt;em&gt;Federation Commander&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Federation and Empire&lt;/em&gt; is now filled with the Armada series which allows for truly epic levels of fleet engagements. Even though the Armada series of products isn&amp;#8217;t quite &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt;, the customizability of the base &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; system has allowed for the game to still mostly feel like and play similarly to the basic Star Fleet Battles system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_750" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-klingon-romulan-and-alien-armada/attachment/klingon-armada/" rel="attachment wp-att-750"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/klingon-armada-210x300.jpg" alt="" title="klingon armada" width="210" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-750" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is the same ship as above, just in Starmada.  Perhaps somewhat less flashy, but only half a page.  The two pictures are essentially to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    While an overall success, the Armada series isn&amp;#8217;t perfect. If you&amp;#8217;re a veteran &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; player, you likely have a large notebook filled with official starship ship system displays from the designer. While &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; has a robust starship construction system allowing you to make your own ships, there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy set of instructions to convert your existing ships to the new system. There just isn&amp;#8217;t a 1:1 conversion. Furthermore both &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; system have a point system to balance combats, but the numbers don&amp;#8217;t quite add up. In &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt;, the standard &lt;em&gt;Constitution&lt;/em&gt; class Heavy Cruiser (the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) has a slight advantage over a Klingon D-7 cruiser. In &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt;, the point total is tipped slightly towards the D-7. This isn&amp;#8217;t a major difference and we&amp;#8217;re only talking a few percentage points in any event, but it is enough to make a veteran scratch their head a bit in confusion. Also, if you have an early revision of the &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; rulebook a critical rule is missing. Specifically, the range based rate of fire rule governing how phasers work isn&amp;#8217;t present. This is easily obtainable on the &lt;a href="http://www.mj12games.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Majestic 12 website&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;ve got a PDF version from Steve Jackson Games&amp;#8217; webstore &lt;a href="http://e23.sjgames.com/" target="_blank"&gt;E23&lt;/a&gt;, the version currently available for download has the rule properly included. I&amp;#8217;m a little concerned about Majestic 12&amp;#8242;s announcement that there is a new Starmada system in the works and due very soon. I have reached out to the developers for more details about the new version of Starmada&amp;#8217;s interoperability with the existing Armada series of products.  At press time I haven&amp;#8217;t received a response. However, in the Majestic 12 forums there is a post that states that there will be a method to &amp;#8220;up convert&amp;#8221; existing Starmada Admiralty Edition ships. If this is in fact the case, the Armada series ships will still be compatible with that ruleset but not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;em&gt;Klingon Armada&lt;/em&gt; and it&amp;#8217;s sister publications in the series share a solid background based on a flexible game engine. The PDFs are comparative in price to the paper version of the rules, running about $12 per complete ruleset. Your $12 purchase contains both the rules for that iteration and an additional book of starships that utilize those rules, but both are available separately if you just need one or the other for some reason. The dead tree version runs $14 or so assuming you can even find a friendly local game store near you. The battle for the idea of a One True Star Trek has waged in nerd circles for years with no end in sight. Pocket Star Trek universes exist in everybody&amp;#8217;s mind and we all have a tendency to disregard what other people have to say about what&amp;#8217;s in their Star Trek. The &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; universe is pretty far from Trek&amp;#8217;s normal as it stands today. The flavor of this universe is firmly grounded on mostly retconned out of existence original Star Trek, the Star Trek animated series, and the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Starfleet-Technical-Manual/dp/B000PKYX7Q" target="_blank"&gt;Franz Joseph Technical Manual&lt;/a&gt;.  A disregard of Paramount official canon in the Star Fleet Universe shouldn&amp;#8217;t discourage you from playing the Armada series.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve done a bunch of podcast episodes.  Sometimes in our unending search to find cool crap for you, we find or mention stuff that may or may not get linked and we get all smartassy and tell you to google it.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d take a few minutes and link you to some of my favorite free-ish stuff that I&amp;#8217;ve found.  Some I&amp;#8217;ve mentioned, some I haven&amp;#8217;t.  Keep in mind that my particular bent is old school style gameplay and turn based strategy.  Most of these picks skew in that direction.  Almost all of this stuff is Windows compatible.  I&amp;#8217;ll specifically mention if they run on OSX as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-737"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_740" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/stscsgfx/" rel="attachment wp-att-740"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/stscsgfx-1024x819.jpg" alt="" title="stscsgfx" width="640" height="511" class="size-large wp-image-740" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Representational but functional.  Par for a turn based game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ststcs.slightlysilly.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Trek Starship Tactical Combat Simulator &amp;#8211; Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, FASA had the license for Star Trek.  By back in the day, I mean just before Star Trek: The Next Generation launched.  The tale differs somewhat on what caused the end of the FASA license, but the all-powerful wikipedia says that two Next Generation supplements weren&amp;#8217;t fully vetted by the licensing gods at Paramount.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, there is a small but devoted following of the Star Trek Starship Combat game &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~ststcsolda/" target="_blank"&gt;online to this day&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the rules from the final edition of the ruleset are implemented Jason Robinson&amp;#8217;s version of the game for windows.  Given all the Paramount official material published since the original rules for this game was released, this is in no way canon, but rather a quick and fun way to get involved in the very old school war-game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit &amp;#8211; March 30, 2012.  To get the game running in Windows 7 (and probably 8) you need to install the Visual Basic DLL located &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q180071/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; prior to running the executable.  &lt;a href="http://subodeon.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=Forward&amp;#038;action=print&amp;#038;thread=2128" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_743" style="width: 860px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/megamek/" rel="attachment wp-att-743"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/megamek.jpg" alt="" title="megamek" width="850" height="646" class="size-full wp-image-743" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Remember that &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot; thing I spoke of in the previous picture?  Yeah, more of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://megamek.info/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megamek &amp;#8211; Java, cross platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, okay, I was a FASA whore when I was a young man.  FASA&amp;#8217;s other major property in the eighties was Battletech, and I penned a bit of a &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommendation-battletech/" target="_blank"&gt;love letter to it&amp;#8217;s modern interpretation here&lt;/a&gt;.  For the last 10 years, there&amp;#8217;s been an unofficial Java version of it called Megamek.  The bot for single play is decent, but this version really shines online versus other humans.  Various mech construction programs like the one we linked to from Solaris Skunk Werks will export to Megamek, making the game about infinitely customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/alien-assault/" rel="attachment wp-att-739"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/alien-assault.jpg" alt="" title="alien assault" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-739" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.teardown.se/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alien Assault &amp;#8211; Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a small group of programmers got together, and pounded together an excellent verbatim implementation of Space Hulk for the computer.  The program befell some legal difficulties with finger pointing between major corporations complicating the issue.  Such are the complications of a third party development of a licensed property.  Long story short, some graphical assets had to change, but the gameplay remained the same.  With a persistent campaign and easily moddable assets, Alien Assault deserves a bit of your time if you&amp;#8217;re a fan of turn based strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_744" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=744"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/babylon5ships.jpg" alt="" title="babylon5ships" width="1024" height="768" class="size-full wp-image-744" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This isn&amp;#039;t Babylon 5, but it came from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://b5warsvault.wikidot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advent of Galactic Wars &amp;#8211; PDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another licensed property that went beyond the rim is the Agents of Gaming product Babylon 5 Wars.  Similar to the very complex Star Fleet Battles, AoG&amp;#8217;s ruleset simulated ship to ship combat in the Babylon 5 universe to exacting detail.  The game was pretty well balanced and presented fairly well, but AoG lost the license when Warner Brothers decided that they &lt;a href="http://worldsofjms.com/usenet/post/020929a.htm" target="_blank"&gt;weren&amp;#8217;t doing anything to enhance the license&lt;/a&gt;.  Since then, Mongoose published their own ruleset, but that&amp;#8217;s gone now too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of fans banded together to protect the work, and released the Advent of Galactic Wars ruleset.  It&amp;#8217;s basically all the rules from the Babylon 5 Wars rulebooks and supplements with the Babylon 5 color text and graphical elements removed.  This manipulation doesn&amp;#8217;t make it any less of a good game, though, just be prepared for lots of rule references as you play!  The linked source also includes ships from other universes, just in case you wanted to run a Robotech versus Star Trek versus Babylon 5 scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_738" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/time-lord/" rel="attachment wp-att-738"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Time-Lord.jpg" alt="" title="Time Lord" width="500" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-738" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The rather plain original cover for Time Lord&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.torsononline.com/hobbies/timelord/main.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timelord : Adventures Through Time and Space &amp;#8211; PDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, back in the day, there were two Doctor Who roleplaying games.  Time passed, and so did the Doctor Who franchise, so into the vortex they went seemingly never to return.  One of the two games was Timelord.  Originally published in a large paperback format rather than the industry conventional 8.5&amp;#215;11 size, I think the game suffered a bit because of it.  In 1998, the game was released for free on the internet.  There are no character creation rules to speak of, but it&amp;#8217;s fairly well fleshed out, at least for classic Who.  Since the new official Doctor Who RPG from Cubicle 7 doesn&amp;#8217;t really acknowledge the earlier series other than some passing mentions, this is the only way to get your classic Who on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_741" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/renegade-legion/" rel="attachment wp-att-741"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/renegade-legion.jpg" alt="" title="renegade legion" width="630" height="298" class="size-full wp-image-741" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;21st century graphics for a 20th century game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.madcoyote.com/kannik/rpg/rl/rl-index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renegade Legion &amp;#8211; PDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When FASA dissolved, their properties went all over the place.  The most egregious treatment after the breakup was Night Shift Games&amp;#8217; handling of the Renegade Legion franchise.  Technically, the license is held by Topps who seemingly has no interest in the product.  The old post FASA Night Shift Games work is available with a fan produced supplement for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, specifically fighter and tank damage are very flowchart oriented.  For fear of sounding old and cantankerous, they don&amp;#8217;t seem to make games like this anymore.  With a unique armor widowing mechanic as well as the wiring diagram damage flowchart, it&amp;#8217;s worth a play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_742" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/battlefleet_gothic/" rel="attachment wp-att-742"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Battlefleet_gothic-1024x692.jpg" alt="" title="Battlefleet_gothic" width="640" height="432" class="size-large wp-image-742" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is one of the most ornate space ships I&amp;#039;ve ever seen, from Battlefleet Gothic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?community=&amp;#038;catId=cat1290319&amp;#038;categoryId=1100007&amp;#038;aId=4300022&amp;amp;_requestid=1122152" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battlefleet Gothic &amp;#8211; PDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one confuses me a great deal.  Games Workshop jealously protects it&amp;#8217;s intellectual property, and even old versions of the Warhammer franchises aren&amp;#8217;t readily available online.  In a notable exception, their own starship combat rules are, and have been since 2008.  It&amp;#8217;s a good game, if a bit ponderous, but most starship combat games are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_748" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommends-free-gaming-stuff/attachment/lastnightonearth/" rel="attachment wp-att-748"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/lastnightonearth-1024x797.jpg" alt="" title="lastnightonearth" width="640" height="498" class="size-large wp-image-748" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Last Night on Earth in the Vassal Engine.  Looks more complicated than it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VASSAL &amp;#8211; Windows, OSX, and Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, if we wanted to play a war-game we&amp;#8217;d have to get a bunch of players together, find a sufficiently clean large flat surface, and break out the million pieces of cardboard or multi-thousand dollar miniature armies.  With the advent and ubiquitousness of fast internet connections, there has to be a better option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a better option.  Founded in 2003, VASSAL is a universal game engine limited only by the ability of the module programmers.  There are &lt;a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Category:Modules"&gt;over 800 games&lt;/a&gt; with modules available for VASSAL.  Some are official, some not so much, and some are straight out &lt;a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Warhammer_40,000" target="_blank"&gt;forbidden by the game designers&lt;/a&gt;!  You still have to have a functional knowledge of the rules for whatever game you&amp;#8217;re playing, but VASSAL will provide everything else you need for a smooth internet play session.  A modicum of technical knowledge is required for proper use- if you can&amp;#8217;t open and redirect ports on your router, then you shouldn&amp;#8217;t serve a game.  Otherwise, if you&amp;#8217;ve got the ability to understand war-game rules, then you can use VASSAL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="attachment_760" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=760"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/urquan_320x240.png" alt="" title="urquan_320x240" width="320" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-760" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Ur-Quan Masters.   One of the best games of it&amp;#039;s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sc2.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Star Control &amp;#8211; The Ur-Quan Masters&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Windows, OSX, and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest video games ever was Spacewar.  Two players duking it out on a single screen for control of the galaxy.  Almost 20 years later the Star Control series was very popular for a number of computers.  In August 2002 Toys for Bob, the developer of the 3D0 released the source code for Star Control 2 to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of the Ur-Quan Masters takes assets from all the games and combines them into one mega-game.  Graphically, the game is dated, but the gameplay is excellent with an outstanding Rock Paper Scissors mechanic and fantastic balance between the factions.  Good for either a campaign or a quick deathmatch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added 2/29/2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_761" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=761"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/mechwarrior.jpg" alt="" title="mechwarrior" width="640" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-761" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Double barreled action, from Mechwarrior 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mektek.net/projects/mw4/" target="_blank"&gt;Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries Free download &amp;#8211; Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechwarrior 2 may have been ubiquitous, but Mechwarrior 4 was a much better game!  Yes, the game is 10 years old, but there is still a vibrant community that stands behind and maintains the game to this day.  Featuring a branching storyline and a robust online contingent of gamers this game is a must play even now, 10 years after release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this whets your appetite a bit.  I intend on this being a living document- as I find more cool stuff in this vein, I&amp;#8217;ll add to it!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>I knew about the comic while the show was airing, but didn't pay it much attention at the time. With the announcement of Terry O'Quinn appearing for two episodes this coming season, I looked back at some of the &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; media, and thought I'd give &lt;a href="https://digital.darkhorse.com/profile/182.falling-skies-1/"&gt;the comic&lt;/a&gt; a chance.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-falling-skies-comic-by-dark-horse/attachment/falling-skies-logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-706"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-706" title="falling-skies-logo" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/falling-skies-logo-e1329975069946.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="239" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genre television isn&amp;#8217;t hard to find. Every year there&amp;#8217;s something produced that tries to tap into our elusive nerd market. Some of it is good, some of it not so much. In the summer of 2011, &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; starring Noah Wylie debuted on TNT. I thought it was mostly good, but I thought it had a ways to go. Too many tropes. Magic BBs causing major plot advancement. I thought it was about as good as &lt;em&gt;Star Trek : The Next Generation&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; first season. In a nutshell, promise unrealized, but there nonetheless. Nobody on the writing staff quite seemed to know who the characters were beyond the main man- Wylie&amp;#8217;s portrayal of history professor Tom Mason. I knew about the comic while the show was airing, but didn&amp;#8217;t pay it much attention at the time. With the announcement of Terry O&amp;#8217;Quinn appearing for two episodes this coming season, I looked back at some of the &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; media, and thought I&amp;#8217;d give &lt;a href="https://digital.darkhorse.com/profile/182.falling-skies-1/"&gt;the comic&lt;/a&gt; a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-701"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-falling-skies-comic-by-dark-horse/attachment/fallingskies1/" rel="attachment wp-att-702"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-702" title="Fallingskies1" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Fallingskies1.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="485" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technologically, the comic uses the Dark Horse portable reader JAVA and html applet. No flash is in use making the reader cross platform and usable on Windows, OSX, iOS, Linux, and most flavors of android. Bookmarks are stored server-side if you have an account, so you can easily pick up reading where you left off even if you used a different device previously. The default page size is somewhat enormous, requiring you to zoom in a bit to see the entire page on one screen but that&amp;#8217;s just my preferred reading method. I tested the website&amp;#8217;s usability on an iPhone 4, an original iPad, and a Macbook Pro running both OSX Lion and Windows 7. The user interface was clear and precise in every iteration of hardware and operating system. I will say though, that a phone isn&amp;#8217;t an optimal platform for comic consumption, so I really don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8217; recommend it. I&amp;#8217;m not sure that any screen smaller than the nearly 10&amp;#8243; diagonal iPad screen is optimal, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have any 7&amp;#8243; devices to test my theory on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-falling-skies-comic-by-dark-horse/attachment/fallingskies2/" rel="attachment wp-att-704"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-704" title="fallingskies2" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/fallingskies2.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="485" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artistically, the comics have a certain grit to them, reflecting the post apocalyptic setting of the show. Most panels I had a pretty good grip who was who. It&amp;#8217;s hard to get a likeness of somebody real exactly right and recognizable panel after panel, angle after angle, page after page. I only had a &amp;#8220;huhwha?&amp;#8221; moment every once in a while. The context of the dialog was consistent, so it was pretty clear who was who by dialog if not always the art. Scaling of sci-fi elements was done well- this is a pet peeve of mine. Skitter ships were consistently large. The aliens themselves were imposing and threatening. Perspectives were done well. Human weapons were easily recognizable as what they were, and for the most part, portrayed accurately with no more artistic license than Hollywood itself uses. As a quick note to comic writers and Hollywood- there are a lot of military members looking for work. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t kill you to hire one or two as advisors if even part time for consultation on such matters like if you can reload anti-tank weaponry or even simple military tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-falling-skies-comic-by-dark-horse/attachment/fallingskies3/" rel="attachment wp-att-703"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-703" title="Fallingskies3" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Fallingskies3.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="482" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a story perspective, the comic takes place before the series itself starts. The invasion is over, the aliens occupy Earth. Militia are forming the Second Massachusetts regiment and with any luck, an organized resistance can be formed to help keep humanity alive. The four issues of the comic (which are contained in the trade paperback, should you go the dead tree route) cover Tom Mason&amp;#8217;s discovery and subsequent joining of the militia and the 2nd Massachusetts regiment. As a primer to the TV series, the bases are covered. Tom &amp;#8220;discusses&amp;#8221; what&amp;#8217;s going on with the world and the invasion in the form of diary entries bookmarking chapters of the comic, giving historical perspective to the &amp;#8220;current&amp;#8221; time. The Skitter and mech threat to the survivors is made abundantly clear by the body count which mounts page after page, as it likely would in the end phases of an alien invasion. In the beginning of every militia formation, you need to find guns, food, and shelter. These realities of post-apocalyptic survival are just touched on in the comic, saving the deeper and heavier implications of humanity teetering on the edge of extinction for the television show. The webcomic, then print comic, is part of the &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; extended universe. While a logical start to the story it may be rendered non-canon by future television episodes, as is often the case with comic adaptations or extensions of other media. The comic is free and fun to read, so no further spoilers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-falling-skies-comic-by-dark-horse/attachment/fallingskies4/" rel="attachment wp-att-705"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-705" title="fallingskies4" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/fallingskies4.jpg" alt="" width="311" height="478" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comic is free on &lt;a href="https://digital.darkhorse.com/"&gt;Dark Horse&amp;#8217;s digital comics web portal&lt;/a&gt;, only requiring a no-cost account be made. Our normal value equation is a little difficult to include here. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in seeing how Tom Mason and family got involved with the 2nd Mass, here&amp;#8217;s where you start. If you&amp;#8217;ve got no interest in &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt;, then this comic&amp;#8217;s not for you. The fact that the Dark Horse comic reader is so nimble on multiple platforms and operating systems should be considered while you figure out what your path is for digital comic distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Civilization V is the latest turn based strategy game in the legacy of Sid Meier. Chances are you’ve heard of, or played, one of the great games in this series. By some awkward chance you haven’t heard of this pentalogy of games (like me), let’s give it a brief run down.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-civilization-v/attachment/civvlogo/" rel="attachment wp-att-729"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729" title="civvlogo" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/civvlogo-e1329974929285.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="239" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, leaders have risen and fallen. As one goes down another must come to power. Have you ever wanted to have a rule remembered in time as your own? I can’t really help you with that. What I can provide is something to allow you to live vicariously through the great leaders of our past. I present to you Sid Meier’s Civilization V by Firaxis. Civilization V is the latest turn based strategy game in the legacy of Sid Meier. Chances are you’ve heard of, or played, one of the great games in this series. By some awkward chance you haven’t heard of this pentalogy of games (like me), let’s give it a brief run down. The Civilization series of games place you in a world with other prominent figures of our past. Through methods of expansion, science, money and diplomacy you navigate the world in search of your ultimate society of victory. This time around, the navigation of the game is built upon a hex grid for movement, with basic stats and strength checks to determine the outcomes of battles. Victory is made by whichever path you choose to take. Of those, there are many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-727"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I must disclose a little here. Turn based games and I have never really got along. Time was always a factor in our arguments. It always seemed like the genre of games was too demanding of my time to get anything accomplished. For that reason, RTS games always were granted my favor. Truth be told, the last even sort-of turn based games that I granted any sort of time were the original Fallout games. After those, these seemingly slow time mongers never even were a blip on my gaming radar. After spending time with Civilization V, henceforth know as Civ 5, I think that perhaps I may have dismissed turn based a bit hastily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Civ 5 is a simple game to jump right into. The game menus are crisp and to the point. In this age of too many options, this is a blessing. Want to jump into a random game? Done. Want to tweak the settings, like your fabled leader, number of players, world type or starting technological age? You can do that too. Never having played a Civilization game in the past, I appreciated the fact that it spelled everything out for me. Not once did I feel lost about what I was jumping into. The objective of the game, well, that was something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon venturing forth in my first game, I was happy to find that everything was continuing to hold my hand. Every building, research project, combat unit and upgrades tell you exactly what their attributes are and what they can do. As your civilization grows, more and more things become available to you. There hasn’t been a thing in any game I’ve been through that left me scratching my head as to what the hell it did. If you ever run into one, let me know. There just wasn’t anything confusing that I could see. Per chance of you arriving at a point where you may be lost on how to progress your piece of earth, it even has you covered there. Advisors are there to provide you guidance on how to grow. Icons are even places next to suggestions on which path to take per that advisors&amp;#8217; specialty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_728" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-civilization-v/attachment/rocketartillery/" rel="attachment wp-att-728"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-728" title="rocketartillery" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/rocketartillery-1024x623.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="389" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ranged combat is a little different this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditions of Victory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some time has passed since there has been a game I played in which you could win in other fashions than slashing or shooting your way to the end. Total world military domination is an option if you choose and you are going to have a hell of a time doing it! You remember that I wasn’t too sure on the objective of the game? That came into play when I went head first into my first challenge- I had no idea how to win. Sure you could check your progress once you figured out where that was (I’ll save you some time. It’s a small circle with the drop down menu on the upper right). It doesn’t really come out and say what you are working towards though. Nor does it ever warn you about the 500 turn limit which would have been nice. There’s a manual I could have read but who does that now though? Given my past with real time strategy games, I figured that pummeling my enemies out of the gate would be the best course of action. Oh, how I was wrong. After ignoring all requests for aid, agreements and open borders from the city-states around me, I knew it was my time to strike. My army was a decent size and ready to take on opponents. I ended up being on the receiving end of an ass beating with only myself to blame. Game number one was done in less than 200 turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next go around, I thought perhaps it would be wise to pace myself a little bit, maybe flow with the events of the game. Going with the flow seemed a better choice than allowing the computer to murder my civilization. While there were no proclamations announcing me supreme ruler of the world, I was able to learn more. My previous attempt at world domination may have been a bit short sighted. Let me explain why- if advances are made on the scientific, economic and political fronts, you military might could crumble even if you have superior numbers. This was a fatal flaw that was embedded in my mind from all those days playing RTS games. Unfortunately, that idea was forcefully extracted from my cranium after my terrible, terrible loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fret not, as there are other conditions under which I could achieve victory. By achieving victory, I really mean avenging my honor. And by avenging my honor, I mean taking my sweet revenge. My eyes were opened to the paths of science and culture. Instead of an arms race, it quickly boils down to a resource balancing act. Build and research as fast as you possibly can. Tailor your next move to maximize whatever value you are looking to win by. There is a catch though. Your army and expansion can’t suffer while you keep working. If either shows any sign of weakness, the other leaders will call you on it. And they mock you. They will let you know just how pathetic you are. In my opinion, I think that most people would fit into this play style though. It is a much easier path to balance to victory. Plus, you don’t have to act as reactionary, withering away your resources when your attack squads start falling. Diplomacy is another option. It is by far the hardest route in which to win. Your world has to be coupled with such a bustling economy to pull it off. Don’t let that detour you if you want to try it. It is possible to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the end, if a decisive victory cannot be won through any of the fore mentioned options, the battle will come by points. This is perfect if you want to play a balancing game with your eyes on the long road. Whichever way you craft your vehicle to subjugation weighs heavily on how you will play the game. Please, try them all. You’ll be surprised just how fun each method can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_730" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-retro-review-civilization-v/attachment/civ5iso/" rel="attachment wp-att-730"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-730" title="civ5iso" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/civ5iso-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This time, hexes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Audio and Visuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Expectations for Civ 5 were actually low for me on the graphic side of things I must admit. It wasn’t to say that it couldn’t look good. It was more of a thought as to if it needed to be. That said, this game is quite the looker. While there isn’t anything brand spanking new or revolutionary, it is still very pretty. This is a good thing considering the amount of time you’ll spending looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I was particularly impressed by were the animations of the individual units. Each unit has a specific animation that it carries out to fulfill its purpose. For example, when you get to the artillery cannons, they have to setup before firing. Upon each initiation of an attack, little people walk up to the heavy guns and set up the legs to brace the force of the shot. Afterwards, when the recoil is all said and done, the gun is reloaded and the legs are put back into place for movement. Each time you call an action, the unit must perform. All animations are fluid and seem to be purposely crafted to the action. Another example that I rather enjoyed were the workers shoveling or raking in unison when working land tiles. For some reason it is enthralling to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any time a world leader interaction occurs, you get a CGI representation speaking to you in their native tongue. It gives a personal touch as if you were having a one on one meeting. While I do like this, I would have appreciated a little more variation in it. Each leader has only a few phrases and small variety of expressions and gestures. Also, each has a different backdrop that never seems to change. No turning of the seasons or different camera angles to pull you deeper into your experience. To add another sour note to the leaders, I have to add something about the CGI itself. All of them just appear to be really cartoony and overly smooth looking. I’d prefer that they looked just a little more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nitpicky graphical complaint is that I wish the images shown once you complete a world wonder looked more appealing. As they stand now, all the pictures look rough, not unlike a painting. While I like the idea of drawing attention to completing one and letting the whole world know, I’m just not a fan of the way these look. There is too much contrast between them and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly on the graphics side, I must warn of some of the issues in this game. I don’t know in my case how much of it was on my end, but this game locks up a lot. For me, it mostly seemed to happen in my interactions with other known leaders. While I’ve read a fair amount about this, there are many people with issues far worse than that. Patches are coming though! And please, look up how to disable the intro video once you’ve watched it. Otherwise, it’ll annoy you as it randomly seems to select when it is done playing if you try and prompt it. I still advocate that it is great to look at though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is something that really must be brought up about this game when it is talked about. Frankly, it is fantastic. Each culture has a different score that progressed as you advance. The greatest thing about it is that it’s all very ambient. Most of the music just lightly adds to the overall atmosphere. Sure, there are events that trigger heavier tones, for instance battle. However, even those sounds fit the mood. Subtle soundtracks are much appreciated as you tend to envelop yourself in this game. More times than not, a game will possess an overpowering soundtrack that just kills the end user experience. Civ 5 is not one of those at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You didn’t need to go anywhere for a while, right? Matches can take a few hours or even days in Civ 5. From my trials a game lasting six hours was not uncommon. You can make this quicker in the settings, but the step down just doesn’t feel the same. If you are a brave soul, turn it to the slowest setting. Descriptios claim that one turn could last the length of a standard speed game to end. Think about that for a second. One turn would be one whole game. To put some perspective on that, during my six hour games each turn would take roughly 45 seconds. Now, amp that up a little to six hours a turn. I am not a brave soul. Frankly, turning the game to that speed intimidated me. I think that is for the best. If it was still a 500 turn game, with the time table I had above it would take 125 days to complete. If I ventured out to do that this review still wouldn’t be done and I might have some serious hygiene concerns I’d need to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All joking aside it is very easy to lose long amounts of time to Civ 5. You get so engrossed in it that you begin to stop tracking things. Take note though, as it is easy to pick up again from where you left off once you are able to pry yourself away. Everything is tracked for you. Because of that, it is very easy for your brain to disconnect. Trouble is you have to want to break away. Just make sure you keep an eye on a clock. (Editor’s Note- Draeno cursed me and Civ V out one day during the review process because it took too much time out of his schedule!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Closing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I was very impressed with Civilization 5. It changed my perceptions of turn based games. Really, it makes me sad that I didn’t approach any other game in the series in the past. From here out, there is a strong possibility that I would pick up another turn based title in the future. As for buying the game, I whole heartily recommend it. Especially I’d say if you were a fan of previous outings or just a fan of the genre. Perhaps if you were on the fence about the purchase, I’d even say snatch it up at a $39.99 price point. As I stated, my own experience may have been crippled by my dying machine. I maintain that Civ 5 killed my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civilization 5, thumbs up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note &amp;#8211; This review was written by Draeno about 14 months ago. Nothing has really changed about the review with patches. We thought it would be relevant considering that there&amp;#8217;s a new expansion for Civ V due soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Back in 2011 Double Fine released Iron Brigade, a playful giant stomping robot of destruction game crossed with tower defense that didn't take itself too seriously. Honestly, it's on a very short list of my favorite games of last year. When we last left our heroes the melodramatically sinister leader of the Signal Vlad lay defeated at the hands of the valiant trench pilots. The mobile trench carrier USS McKinley steamed off into the sunset with our heroes aboard. A great deal has happened since we left our victorious heroes. In our world, a legal challenge forced the game's name to change to Iron Brigade. With the name change came a survival/horde mode. In their world, Vlad has apparently survived and rocketed off to Mars in a 400 point downloadable content called Rise of the Martian Bear. Should you spend the 400 point premium to continue the valiant effort against the tube menace, or should Vlad be left to attack humanity from Mars?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-rise-of-the-martian-bear-dlc-for-iron-brigade/attachment/rmb2/" rel="attachment wp-att-726"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/rmb2.jpg" alt="" title="Rise of the Martian Bear" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 Double Fine released &lt;del datetime="2012-02-17T20:23:20+00:00"&gt;Trenched&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;Iron Brigade&lt;/em&gt;, a playful giant stomping robot of destruction game crossed with tower defense that didn&amp;#8217;t take itself too seriously. We reviewed it &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/review-trenched-by-double-fine/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and honestly, it&amp;#8217;s on a very short list of my favorite games of last year. When we last left our heroes the melodramatically sinister leader of the Signal Vlad lay defeated at the hands of the valiant trench pilots. The mobile trench carrier &lt;em&gt;USS McKinley&lt;/em&gt; steamed off into the sunset with our heroes aboard. A great deal has happened since we left our victorious heroes. In our world, a legal challenge forced the game&amp;#8217;s name to change to Iron Brigade. With the name change came a survival/horde mode. In their world, Vlad has apparently survived and rocketed off to Mars in a 400 point downloadable content called &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear&lt;/em&gt;. Should you spend the 400 point premium to continue the valiant effort against the tube menace, or should Vlad be left to attack humanity from Mars?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-723"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, there isn&amp;#8217;t a lot of elapsed time from the end of the core &lt;em&gt;Iron Brigade&lt;/em&gt; game and the Rise of the Martian Bear. After discovering his emaciated body in the core of the blasted Earth broadcast center, Vlad transferred his consciousness to the Signal itself. Needing to manifest himself physically once more, he outfitted his pet bear with a grand mustache and set forth to enslave humanity again from the cold reaches of space. Over the course of five missions, you have to protect the &lt;em&gt;McKinley&lt;/em&gt; from attack while it&amp;#8217;s being outfitted to travel into space. After blasting off, you spend some time on the moon before reaching your ultimate destination- Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_725" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-rise-of-the-martian-bear-dlc-for-iron-brigade/attachment/rmb1/" rel="attachment wp-att-725"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/rmb1.jpg" alt="" title="Martian Bear 1" width="1280" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-725" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mayhem on the Red Planet.  Blast them Tubes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a gameplay perspective, &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear&lt;/em&gt; is hard, even with a level 10 pilot fully ranked from the original title. I don&amp;#8217;t think I can stress this enough. &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear&lt;/em&gt; is hard. It&amp;#8217;s designed as such. My first attempts at the DLC review were solo, as just about everybody this week is playing the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; demo. This left my regular squad unavailable. I must have thrown myself at the first mission 11 times before I beat it. When I finally did, it was by the skin of my teeth. The second mission took 18 times, the third, 19 times. I was way too frustrated to count how many times I played the fourth mission before beating it. For fear of blowing a gasket I still haven&amp;#8217;t completed the DLC solo. There was no real trial and error process. There was just way too many very powerful enemies including some new ones raining down entirely too much fire on my position to have any success. Iron Brigade&amp;#8217;s combat mechanics are very much a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock" target="_blank"&gt;rock/paper/scissors(lizard/Spock)&lt;/a&gt; kind of situation. No matter what you have on your trench something else always seems like it will work out a bit better at some point in the onslaught of enemies facing you on any given level. You just can&amp;#8217;t carry enough towers and have enough firepower to do the job in single player. The problem is all of the missions have wide-spread objectives you need to protect simultaneously. As I alluded to before, I think this is by design, not by accident. I finished the original game co-op with a full squad, so I never played the last few levels solo. As an experiment I went back to the Pacific Theater from the core game and tried some of those levels by myself. The last few levels before the final confrontation with Vlad were also very hard single player. It&amp;#8217;s pretty clear that the game was designed with opposition tailored towards requiring all the firepower that multiple players can muster to defeat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear&lt;/em&gt; adds a great deal of replay value to the core game. Two new survival levels are added to the game bringing the total to three. There are three new bad guys added that appear in the DLC campaign levels and all of the survival missions. More importantly, 80 new pieces of gear have been added including some very welcome new emplacements. I found that the best testing ground for new equipment was in survival as you&amp;#8217;ll see every enemy type at least once. Assuming you survive long enough you can collect some new loot in the process! I didn&amp;#8217;t see any new trench chassis types, but they do seem to have received a helpful health upgrade at some point. If you&amp;#8217;re into total overkill, bringing some of the epic weaponry you receive in Rise of the Martian Bear or survival back to the core game will drive up your kill counts for the glory of yourself or the enrichment of your squad. After the thrashing you receive over and over in the DLC, going back to the core game with mega-weaponry can be cathartic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_724" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-rise-of-the-martian-bear-dlc-for-iron-brigade/attachment/rmb3/" rel="attachment wp-att-724"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/rmb3.jpg" alt="" title="Martian Bear 2" width="1280" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-724" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The landscape of Mars is foreign.  Use it to your advantage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical standpoint Iron Brigade is as solid as it&amp;#8217;s predecessor. I didn&amp;#8217;t experience any real bugs or issues other than some currency of the game (scrap) being stuck behind a girder or in a hole or other such obstruction from time to time. Frame rates with one exception were solid. I had a minor hiccup when I received a beacon from someone on my friend&amp;#8217;s list who signed on and wanted me to play Halo. even though he was playing something else.  Beacons are a new feature of xBox Live where somebody on your buddy list sets a game that they want to play.  You get notification of this desire from this person, even if the buddy isn&amp;#8217;t playing that game at the time.  The response to beacons isn&amp;#8217;t the fault of &lt;em&gt;Iron Brigade&lt;/em&gt; nor of &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear&lt;/em&gt;, but rather the new OS on the xBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rise of the Martian Bear is more of the same gameplay and experience you&amp;#8217;d expect from Iron Brigade. That&amp;#8217;s both good and bad. There&amp;#8217;s nothing here that will attract a player dissatisfied from aspects the first game as core gameplay is basically unchanged. If you feel you&amp;#8217;ve extracted maximum enjoyment out of the core title more of the same isn&amp;#8217;t a draw. However, if more survival levels and better gear appeal to you or you want to revisit gameplay style from the core &lt;em&gt;Iron Brigade&lt;/em&gt;, then 400 Microsoft Points is a very low price to pay. You get arguably 10 or more hours of gameplay added to the title. Whether you do or don&amp;#8217;t help me rid the world of the evil Tubes, I&amp;#8217;m getting my ass back to Mars to finish this fight.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>As we mentioned a &lt;a href="http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2011/11/21/the-walking-deads-hunger-grows-season-3-renewal/"&gt;few months ago&lt;/a&gt;, the show was able to pick up a third season. Since then we’ve learned that &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; has a little more in store for viewers. Even amidst rumors of cast departures, story changes, and ownership lawsuits, AMC increased the season order from 13 episodes to 16.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/season-3-of-the-walking-dead-gets-more-episodes/attachment/walkingdeadmoreeps/" rel="attachment wp-att-716"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/walkingdeadmoreeps.jpg" alt="Walking Dead, AMC, episodes, season 3" title="walkingdeadmoreeps" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the heels of an episode marathon and a mid-season premiere, fans of &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; have even more to look forward to other than the rest of the season. As we mentioned a &lt;a href="http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2011/11/21/the-walking-deads-hunger-grows-season-3-renewal/"&gt;few months ago&lt;/a&gt;, the show was able to pick up a third season. Since then we’ve learned that &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; has a little more in store for viewers. Even amidst rumors of cast departures, story changes, and ownership lawsuits, AMC increased the season order from 13 episodes to 16. This is good news for an hour long drama that has nothing but increase its episode order every season (6, 13, 16 respectively). In a time where shows are approaching and sticking to the 13 episodes mark it is good to see in a genre show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we going to see the tale of the soldier in the tank that Rick ran into during season 1? Are the writers going to try and line up the series to be more like the comic? Will we see the rumored web series have new life in the extended episodes? We can all wonder, but in the end it’ll come back to the road of survival. I’m certainly not going to argue against seeing more of this great show. If we get more episodes like last night, we could just see a 20 episode order for a season four. Check out the summary below.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>It seems that &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; just hasn’t done enough to change MMOs or video games as we know it. I guess they felt the need to topple the tabletop industry with a makeover for some of our most beloved games. Getting their first play through at the New York Toy Fair Blizzard is bringing to life &lt;em&gt;Monopoly: World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Risk: Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; in a venture with &lt;a href="http://www.usaopoly.com/"&gt;USAopoly&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; just hasn’t done enough to change MMOs or video games as we know it. I guess they felt the need to topple the tabletop industry with a makeover for some of our most beloved games. Getting their first play through at the New York Toy Fair Blizzard is bringing to life &lt;em&gt;Monopoly: World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Risk: Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; in a venture with &lt;a href="http://www.usaopoly.com/"&gt;USAopoly&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly these are a “fresh takes on two classic board games” according to Blizzard’s press release. Both titles bring the worlds to players’ hands from properties renamed in lieu of Warcraft zones or bringing Protoss, Terran, and Zerg players to the battle front. Blizzard is even getting potential players involved with the production of the games by having them vote for the &lt;em&gt;Monopoly&lt;/em&gt; player pieces via Facebook. Make sure to at least cast your vote for Murky &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/questions/10150584585744034/?qa_ref=ssp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that these aren’t the first &lt;em&gt;Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; tabletop games we’ve seen either. They are the first to take the form of some of the classics though. What do you think? Is it bad enough that Blizzard is taking your $15 a month for &lt;em&gt;WoW&lt;/em&gt;? Is it really necessary to retcon some of the staples in table gaming? I guess we’ll find out when they hit the shelves later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look forward to &lt;em&gt;Monopoly: World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; to be released in May 2012 at price point of $39.95, while &lt;em&gt;Risk: Starcraft&lt;/em&gt; will be out later this summer at $49.45.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>About two weeks ago, we &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/s02e03-jordan-weisman/" target="_blank"&gt;interviewed Jordan Weisman&lt;/a&gt; for the show. I made a flippant remark about how he was responsible for most of my gaming purchases over the years, and we all had a nice laugh about college funds. I thought about it a bit more. While I'm sure my personal contribution to the college fund was pennies rather than dollars, I do have a favorite game of his that I keep poking at year after year. We did allude to it in the podcast- I love me some &lt;em&gt;Battletech&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago, we &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/s02e03-jordan-weisman/" target="_blank"&gt;interviewed Jordan Weisman&lt;/a&gt; for the show. I made a flippant remark about how he was responsible for most of my gaming purchases over the years, and we all had a nice laugh about college funds. I thought about it a bit more. While I&amp;#8217;m sure my personal contribution to the college fund was pennies rather than dollars, I do have a favorite game of his that I keep poking at year after year. We did allude to it in the podcast- I love me some &lt;em&gt;Battletech&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I like &lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mech Commander&lt;/em&gt; on various operating systems and consoles, but nothing really compares to some tabletop mech stomping destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-707"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_711" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-recommendation-battletech/attachment/battledroids/" rel="attachment wp-att-711"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-711 " title="battledroids" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/battledroids.jpg" alt="Battledroids circa 1984" width="520" height="420" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is what $14.99 got you in 1984. Yeah, it was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke out my 1984 vintage &lt;a href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Battledroids" target="_blank"&gt;Battledroids&lt;/a&gt; box set that I purchased as a teenager from a game store &lt;a href="http://www.sci-fi-city.com/_orlando_files/history.htm" target="_blank"&gt;that still exists to this day&lt;/a&gt;. How times have changed. The box still had the rubber bases for the cardboard chits, a brief rulebook, some graphical representations of some lifted from anime stomping robots, and to a 14 year old brain, a world of possibilities. As a first iteration of the rules, the equipment sets were rudimentary yet well balanced between weight for construction, heat, and damage. In this day and age, the level of rules as presented then approaches the beer and pretzels threshold. Good balance, simple mech construction, and easy gameplay. The initial sets didn&amp;#8217;t even have rules for buildings, cities, air cover, or other armored vehicles- those were entirely different boxed sets that arrived much later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an assortment of company closures, license swaps, and intellectual property purchases, about seven years ago Fanpro published &lt;a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=24642&amp;#038;it=1&amp;#038;affiliate_id=384297" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total Warfare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;- the modern equivalent of my decades old boxed set for the battle tech enthusiast. It assumed a certain level of rule familiarity as well as other publications in the purchaser&amp;#8217;s hands for play, such as technical readouts with mech specifications. The rules, just the rules, and nothing but the rules, all in one tome. This one book covered the rules of warfare all the way from infantry up to aerospace units. Construction of all these units lives in the &lt;a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=24750&amp;#038;it=1&amp;#038;affiliate_id=384297" target="_blank"&gt;Technical Manual&lt;/a&gt; now, a discrete tome for the customizer and totally optional. If you&amp;#8217;re so inclined, a free cross platform design tool can be downloaded from the &lt;a href="http://www.solarisskunkwerks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Solaris Skunk Werks page&lt;/a&gt;.  Sure, there&amp;#8217;s even more rules that have been introduced since &lt;em&gt;Total Warfare&lt;/em&gt; was originally published, and there&amp;#8217;s more construction options than presented in the Tech Manual, but that&amp;#8217;s how the game industry works. The &lt;em&gt;Battletech&lt;/em&gt; universe suffers less from &lt;a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=81896&amp;#038;affiliate_id=384297" target="_blank"&gt;game play upgrades&lt;/a&gt; than most other games, so the incremental changes over the years in other source books are both optional and not a problem to integrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, my entire $14.99 purchase from 1984 is a free PDF now modernized for the 21st century. To entice you into the world Catalyst Game Systems, the current license holder, &lt;a href="http://bg.battletech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/BattleTechQuick-Start-Rules.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;has a starter download&lt;/a&gt; to get you up to speed with the universe and basic game play. If you&amp;#8217;re accustomed to the &lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior&lt;/em&gt; computer games the universe is familiar, but game play is a bit different by nature of the media change. Plus the price is right. For the big price of free, you get the details on how to play the game, a handful of mech specs, a few tanks, and some infantry. More of a role-player? They&amp;#8217;ve got a &lt;a href="http://bg.battletech.com/download/QSR_ATimeOfWar.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;basic free PDF for that too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year or so will see a resurgence of the battlemech on consoles and the PC. There&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://www.mechwarriortc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior&lt;/em&gt; title coming out for the iOS&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.mwomercs.com/" target="_blank"&gt;free to play game due shortly&lt;/a&gt;. I alluded to a free &lt;a href="http://www.mektek.net/projects/mw4/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; release in a review the other day. That&amp;#8217;s a fantastic game too, if a bit dated by modern standards. You owe it to yourself to see where all this started. Even if you don&amp;#8217;t buy the rulebooks, download the PDFs, grab a couple of buddies and play.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Lately Dungeons of Dredmor by Gaslamp Games has grabbed my attention. Gameplay is decidedly old school. The graphics and game mechanics are in a similar vein. I know I can make the time to enjoy a Roguelike dungeon crawler, but should you?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeons-of-dredmor-and-the-realm-of-the-diggle-gods/attachment/dredmorbanner/" rel="attachment wp-att-699"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-699 aligncenter" title="dredmorbanner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/dredmorbanner.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to be attracted to titles that rekindle an old interest. First, there was &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-logic-factorys-ascendancy-for-the-ios/" target="_blank"&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/a&gt;. Next came a slew of other remakes and re-imaginings for various operating systems including the free release of &lt;a href="http://www.mektek.net/projects/mw4/" target="_blank"&gt;Mechwarrior 4&lt;/a&gt;. Lately, though, Dungeons of Dredmor by &lt;a href="http://www.gaslampgames.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gaslamp Games&lt;/a&gt; has grabbed my attention. Gameplay is decidedly old school. The graphics and game mechanics are in a similar vein. I know I can make the time to enjoy a Roguelike dungeon crawler, but should you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-685"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The term Roguelike has been coined to describe a genre of games that are typically turn based with a text-based graphical interface. They are a throwback to the single digit megahertz days where graphics took an exacting toll on game performance and the mechanics of the game were primary over presentation. It can be argued that the original Dungeons and Dragons gold box games drew inspiration from early Roguelikes. Dungeons of Dredmor is certainly a roguelike- it has most of the characteristics; randomized dungeons, an assortment of items (some random in nature) and turn based gameplay. It does eschew the ASCII based presentation for a whimsical graphical display, but that&amp;#8217;s not a strike against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_688" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeons-of-dredmor-and-the-realm-of-the-diggle-gods/attachment/dredmordead/" rel="attachment wp-att-688"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-688" title="dredmordead" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/dredmordead-1024x789.jpg" alt="It gets a little crazy in Dredmor." width="640" height="493" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In roguelike death is death. Don&amp;#39;t take it too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with a dungeon crawl, the basic formula is simple. Generate a character by whatever means the game allows, saddle up and smash some bad guys. Collect, craft, or buy better gear as you descend into the depths and sell the crap to further finance the expedition. Dredmor takes the skills as attributes method of character development. Basically, whatever seven skills you pick from the pool determine your starting attributes. A subset of calculated attributes based off the primary attributes are calculated from there. I&amp;#8217;m going to brace you for the cold hard truth. Even if you&amp;#8217;re a veteran of the roguelike battlefield you&amp;#8217;re going to die a lot. In most roguelikes, death is permanent. If your character dies, that&amp;#8217;s it. Dredmor&amp;#8217;s default setting is perma-death, as having retrievable game saves is generally considered cheating in this genre. There is mercifully a check box to allow game saves to be used, which I consider a great addition in games like this for the more casual berserker types like yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is, well, roguelike. You take your shot, then everybody who can take a shot at you takes theirs. Anyone familiar with traditional RPGs should know this concept. There are three general classes of weapons- melee, ranged, and thrown. Melee weapons have traditional breakdowns like mace, staff, sword, and axe. Ranged weapons are in the form of an equippable crossbow and bolts, some with area effects or other special attacks. Thrown weapons range from softballs, through bolas, up to grenades and other area affect weapons. &#160;There are no specific class prohibitions per se on any class of weapons. What you wield is chosen by the skill set you select during character creation. Want a sword swinging Gandalf mage? Fine. Rather play a vampiric duel axe wielding Viking? That&amp;#8217;s fine too. Your approach to combat will vary depending on what you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_687" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeons-of-dredmor-and-the-realm-of-the-diggle-gods/attachment/dredmorzoo/" rel="attachment wp-att-687"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-687" title="dredmorzoo" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/dredmorzoo-1024x641.jpg" alt="Dungeons of Dredmor, Diggle, Gods, Gaslamp Games, Review, Roguelike" width="640" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It gets a little crazy in Dredmor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was not well during my (admittedly continuing) playtime with Dredmor. My initial purchase of the game was with an Indie Bundle and all was going fairly well. A patch came out, and all of a sudden, save games didn&amp;#8217;t seem to function by hard crashing the game on load. This was fixed and seems to be limited to players on OSX Lion. The smaller population of users inflicted by this is makes it not a large, all encompassing bug by any means. I&amp;#8217;ve had a periodic random crash but since I&amp;#8217;m not playing on perma-death mode, that doesn&amp;#8217;t bother me a lot. Gaslamp Games has issued a fair amount of bug fixes and promise more content in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, here&amp;#8217;s the bottom line. If you hate turn based games, and just can&amp;#8217;t play them, then Dungeons of Dredmor isn&amp;#8217;t for you. Everybody else can and should play this well crafted humorous take on the rogue like genre. Dredmor&amp;#8217;s regular price is $4.99 on Steam. There is also an expansion that adds more monsters, items, and generally more content for another $2.99. I consider both the main title and the expansion to be what you want to purchase here and it&amp;#8217;s the state I reviewed the game. The combination costs all of $7.98 combined when not on sale. We&amp;#8217;ve all spent a lot more for a lot less, movie tickets, large creme drinks at Starbucks, or what have you. The dollar to hour of entertainment equation weighs heavily towards Dredmor rather than you keeping your paltry stack of cash, so go buy it now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the title and expansion were purchased by the reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Reports are coming in that Terry O'Quinn has been cast In TNT's &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; in the role of a history professor and mentor to Tom Mason, as portrayed by Noah Wylie.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/terry-oquinn-headed-to-tnts-falling-skies/attachment/oquinnfallingskies/" rel="attachment wp-att-698"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/oquinnfallingskies.jpg" alt="John Locke, Terry O&amp;#039;Quinn, Falling Skies, Miracle BB, Tom Mason, Noah Wylie" title="oquinnfallingskies" width="275" height="393" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-698" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You may not know his name, but I bet you know his face.  He&amp;#8217;s played Admirals both Starfleet and U.S. Navy, Generals, Colonels, and Majors. He&amp;#8217;s currently portraying a Lieutenant Commander ex-Navy Seal on &lt;em&gt;Hawaii Five-0&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps his most popular role in the genre is John Locke on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/"&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Moving back to our genre, &lt;a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/02/03/terry-oquinn-heading-to-tnts-falling-skies-exclusive/"&gt;Entertainment Weekly reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642368/"&gt;Terry O&amp;#8217;Quinn&lt;/a&gt; has been cast in the role of a history professor and mentor to Tom Mason, as portrayed by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001864/"&gt;Noah Wylie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you miss &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt;? In a unique spin on the genre, &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; portrays an American resistance against an alien invasion which is all but complete. Humanity survives on it&amp;#8217;s wits alone and scavenges to survive. The end of the first season series ended with a miracle RPG shot fired by Tom Mason, disabling part of a alien base from much farther away than I thought possible. On the way back to the base after the miracle BB, Mason ends up voluntarily leaving the resistance and flying off with the aliens at their &amp;#8220;invitation&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not clear yet what specifically O&amp;#8217;Quinn&amp;#8217;s character&amp;#8217;s role is on the second season of &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; beyond &amp;#8220;mentor&amp;#8221;. Time will tell, as &lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt; second season debuts sometime this summer.  &lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you just need another special edition console to go along with your &lt;em&gt;Halo Reach&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 3&lt;/em&gt; Xboxes? Whatever the reason is be prepared to force sprint to your favorite retailer to shell out $449.99 for the new &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Bundle.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/kinect-star-wars-bundle-and-game-to-be-released-april-3rd/attachment/star-wars-xbox-solo/" rel="attachment wp-att-693"&gt;&lt;img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-693" title="star-wars-xbox-solo" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/star-wars-xbox-solo.jpg" alt="Xbox 360, Star Wars, Kinect, R2D2, C-3PO, release date" width="300" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Missed out on the R2D2 edition of the &lt;a href="http://support.verizonwireless.com/system_update/droidr2d2.html"&gt;Motorola Droid 2&lt;/a&gt; a few years back? Have you been drooling for another piece of boxy, technological modeled after the world’s favorite astromech droid (or his copper counterpart)? Maybe you just need another special edition console to go along with your &lt;em&gt;Halo Reach&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 3&lt;/em&gt; Xboxes? Whatever the reason is be prepared to force sprint to your favorite retailer to shell out $449.99 for the new &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Bundle. When you might ask? It appears that Xbox Live’s Major Nelson let the proverbial bantha out of the bag today. The console and &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; will be dropping from hyperspace to arrive on shelves on April 3, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few breadcrumbs of new information about &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; were also detailed in the release. Are they something to get really excited about? I’ll let you be the judge of the list below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With five dynamic modes – Jedi Destiny: Dark Side Rising, Podracing, Rancor Rampage, Galactic Dance Off and Duels of Fate – &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; makes it possible for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans of all ages to delve into immersive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; experiences. In addition to the previously announced Jedi, Podracing and Rancor modes, Xbox 360 and LucasArts have today unveiled new additions to the game, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New experiences within Jedi Destiny Mode, including:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space battles: As you travel the Galaxy to face an evil that threatens to undermine the fabric of the Republic, you’ll engage with forces of the Empire in intense space battles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeder Bikes and Landspeeders: Pilot iconic Speeder Bikes and Landspeeders on your epic journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New duels: Battle opponents like Count Dooku and Darth Vader on your journey to become a Jedi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Duels of Fate mode, a battle-by-battle experience to sharpen your Jedi skills against the Dark Side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Galactic Dance Off mode loaded with Star Wars-themed pop tunes where those still honing their Jedi skills can take a break to battle Darth Vader on the dance floor or bust a move “Solo style.” (&lt;em&gt;Note: Buyers of the special console will have the ability to play C-3PO in this mode.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think this is promising to shape up to be a must have for Star Wars and Xbox fans alike? Is this another cash grab by &lt;a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/"&gt;LucasArts&lt;/a&gt;? Was the dance mode really necessary? Why didn’t they throw in a &lt;em&gt;Cantina Band&lt;/em&gt; mode as well? I know I won’t personally be buying it as one special edition is enough for this household. Will you?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>It’s been some time since I have checked on the fast paced, mech fighter &lt;em&gt;Hawken&lt;/em&gt;. It appears some very welcome news has given us something to look forward to with the &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt; powered game.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/hawken-beta-and-release-dates-announced/attachment/hawken-release/" rel="attachment wp-att-691"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Hawken-release.jpg" alt="Hawken, free-to-play, mech, release, beta, Adhesive Games" title="Hawken-release" width="300" height="375" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-691" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s been some time since I have checked on the fast paced, mech fighter &lt;em&gt;Hawken&lt;/em&gt;. It appears some very welcome news has given us something to look forward to with the &lt;em&gt;Unreal&lt;/em&gt; powered game. Sign-ups for the closed beta have finally opened up for participants! If the trailers have inspired you, it would be wise to submit your intent to play as soon as possible. As it stands right now, &lt;em&gt;Hawken&lt;/em&gt; is advising possible players to invite friends in order to reserve your chosen callsign before the actual launch. According to an e-mail received after signup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PILOTS WANTED.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Soldier.&lt;br /&gt;
You have elected to take part in the Hawken closed beta.&lt;br /&gt;
Enlist three friends by sharing the link below and we&amp;#8217;ll reserve your callsign before training begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are free to fight 12.12.12.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only have beta signups started for &lt;em&gt;Hawken&lt;/em&gt;, but two greatly important pieces of information have been released as well. First, the announcement has been made that the game is going to go into the free-to-play model. A wise move on the part of &lt;a href="http://www.adhesivegames.com/"&gt;Adhesive Games&lt;/a&gt;, as that is becoming the go to model for online games these days. The second is perhaps the biggest announcement of all, a release date. Slated for 12/12/12, the game is looking to make an impact before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could 2012 be the return of the mech? Need some video to remind you why? I can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-shortcode"&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="600" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://www.hawkengame.com/blog/"&gt;Hawken website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro Tip- &lt;a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/piezo/" target="_blank"&gt;Piezo by Rogue Ameoba&lt;/a&gt; is currently not compatible with the X.7.3 patch to OSX Lion to record Skype.  &lt;a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/" target="_blank"&gt;Audio Hijack Pro&lt;/a&gt; is, but you have to insure the &amp;#8220;instant capture&amp;#8221; extension is installed!  Knowing is half the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though you like us, I know you&amp;#8217;re really staying for the last half or so of the podcast with Jordan Weisman. Yeah, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Weisman"&gt;Jordan Weisman&lt;/a&gt;, directly responsible for bringing you Crimson Steam Pirates, Crimson Skies, Battletech, the original FASA Star Trek Roleplaying Game and loads more.  &lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/everquest-goes-free-to-play-in-march-2012/attachment/eq-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-675"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/EQ-banner.jpg" alt="" title="EQ-banner" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-675" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In an announcement that brought out the inner school girl in me, Sony Online Entertainment announced today that the ageless MMO &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; will be headed to free-to-play status in March. Calling for current players to look ahead in the next step of online play, as well as sounding the trumpets to players of yore, SOE looks to inject life into older world of Norrath. What makes this announcement even more special is that it will be going free-to-play in the month that marks its 13th year running. Think about that number for a moment, 13. That is a staggering number for any game, especially considering that it was one of the founding games to truly craft what we know as massive multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking on many of the traits that its sibling &lt;em&gt;EverQuest 2&lt;/em&gt; took on, &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; is headed towards a tiered system of play options. While still paying $15 a month will grant you everything you had in the game before, playing for free will limit you to &lt;a href="http://www.everquest.com/free/"&gt;fewer options&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be limited in character slots, available classes and races, spell tiers and others playing factors. I highly doubt my &lt;a href="http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1235346"&gt;Iksar Beastlord&lt;/a&gt; will be one of the character races and classes that will be available as free on launch. However, the one thing that won’t be restricted is content. Players can elect to pay the $5 upgrade fee to silver in order to bump up various things. Older raiders will laugh that silver only bumps you to 1000 alternate advancement points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; producer Tom “Phathom” Terrazas had some kind words about the upcoming changes. “Free-To-Play is the best fit for &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; and we are looking forward to supporting the game and our dedicated fans for years to come. This is a great year for everyone associated with &lt;em&gt;EverQuest&lt;/em&gt; and SOE. We think you&amp;#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised at what&amp;#8217;s coming in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to change my pants.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in an interesting time in my life where my regular food avenues aren&amp;#8217;t routinely available.  Right now, I&amp;#8217;ve got a nice microwave, a small hotplate, and that&amp;#8217;s about all.  Not up to exactly Iron Chef or Top Chef spec.  There are routine and decent food delivery options available to me, but they run out of appeal after a while.  No matter how good, the same options day in and day out just aren&amp;#8217;t appetizing after a while.  While working, in the background I heard an ad for Burger King delivery on ye olde television.  So, I thought I&amp;#8217;d give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-667"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:07 : Found the &lt;a href="https://www.bkdelivers.com/#!welcome" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.  Minimalistic design, but functional.  Took a minute to figure out how to not get tomatoes on my sandwich, but after locating the &amp;#8220;customize your order&amp;#8221; button the process was simple.  Nothing a bigger checkbox wouldn&amp;#8217;t fix.  The service requires an $8 minimum order, and adds a $2 delivery fee.  Have you seen fast food prices lately?  It takes very little effort to get to $8 so this isn&amp;#8217;t an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:11 : Decided to write this review.  Hit submit on a custom Whopper, fries, 20 oz coca-cola product, and a pie of some sort.  Got an email immediately confirming my order.  Estimated time of delivery read &amp;#8220;ASAP&amp;#8221; which was a bit troubling, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d ride it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#8217;s where it goes to crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:02 : No order.  Called the convenient 800-adjacent number to wonder what the deal was.  Got put on hold for about 20 seconds before speaking with a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:05 : Finished conversation with &amp;#8220;Michael&amp;#8221;, the handy operator at BKdelivers.com.  He said he&amp;#8217;d call the store and somebody would be in touch on the phone in a few minutes.  No call arrived.  However&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:22 : Food arrives.  The food wasn&amp;#8217;t in quite the same Burger King containers, but rather in cardboard for the fried products with adequate venting to prevent steam from making the food soggy.  Nice touch.  The whopper itself was in a styrofoam container vaguely reminiscent of the intentions McDLT container of old- you know, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTSdUOC8Kac" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#8220;keeps the hot side hot, the cold side cold&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.  The meat and bottom bun were in one pocket, and the vegetables, topping, and top bun were in their own compartment of the same container.  The lettuce was fast-food fresh and amazingly still crisp.  I would have been more pleased with the temperature of the food if it wasn&amp;#8217;t apparent that the food was only made after my call fifteen minutes prior, but it beats the food being an hour old and showing up late, so that&amp;#8217;s kind of a wash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;71 minutes from order to delivery.  I&amp;#8217;m not super-pleased about that, but the service is only in testing and in limited areas.  It was also pretty clear that the call from corporate to the store preparing the order shook the order loose, and got it to me within 20 minutes of making the &amp;#8220;where&amp;#8217;s my food&amp;#8221; call.  With time, I&amp;#8217;d like to see the delivery time at 30-45 minutes, and that&amp;#8217;s what the phone operator said the normal delivery time was.  A quick internet search has revealed that people in my area are experiencing about hour-long delivery times, so my experience wasn&amp;#8217;t out of the ordinary by any stretch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve got to have a Whopper and can&amp;#8217;t get out, then the delivery service or something like it is the only game in town.  Right now, it&amp;#8217;s hard for me to recommend it without qualifications unless you&amp;#8217;re okay with waiting an hour for your food to arrive&lt;/p&gt;

Did your family embrace your geek side this holiday season, but didn’t know what to get you? Instead did they give you some gift cards or a certificate for our favorite &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com"&gt;online retailers&lt;/a&gt;? If they didn’t give you enough for a fancy &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; product or if &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/blog/2010/12/our-magical-unicorn-customs-ad.html"&gt;canned unicorn meat&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t look all that appealing to you, I might be able to help you out. Do you like board games? How do you feel about zombies? What if I told you that there is a board game out there that pairs the two of those together in one fun, cheap package? It sounds great, right? Let me tell you about &lt;em&gt;Oh No…Zombies!&lt;/em&gt; then.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-649"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_653" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-starting-out/" rel="attachment wp-att-653"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Starting-Out.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Starting-Out" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-653" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The board is pretty easy to setup for Oh No&amp;#8230;Zombies! Everything is marked to make the game start off with little time wasted setting up complicated scenery or units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most things in zombie filled situations, the object of &lt;em&gt;Oh No…Zombies!&lt;/em&gt; is to stay alive. Imagine that you and your friends are trapped in a small shack with no way to reach help because your radio lacks battery power. There are four stores in the area that would most likely have what you need. Going outside of the cabin presents a small problem. Your disheveled hovel is surrounded by a graveyard that just happens to be full of the risen undead. I don’t think anyone knows how they got there. Everyone has to admit that it is a pretty bad situation. Someone must venture out to get the batteries otherwise you’ll surely perish once the zombies figure out how to get inside. Two to four players will have the pleasure of maneuvering across the field of the dead. Hopefully you will make it back without being bitten. How complicated could that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_654" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-trapped/" rel="attachment wp-att-654"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Trapped.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Trapped" width="480" height="720" class="size-full wp-image-654" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In typical undead uprising fashion, you and your friends have found yourselves trapped in a shed with no way of contacting help. Why would you need help? Because the shed is in a graveyard of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it really isn’t that hard. &lt;em&gt;Zombies&lt;/em&gt; is quite possibly the easiest game I’ve played in a tabletop setting. Obviously there are more mechanics to it than &lt;em&gt;Don’t Break the Ice&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Operation&lt;/em&gt;, but this isn’t a kiddy game folks. Though, I can certainly see my daughter being able to grasp the concept. In the box you’ll find three dice, six zombie figures, eight player figures (four human and four zombies), game board, weapon and battery cards and a stack of action cards to draw from when players encounter a zombie. Playing the game is actually pretty simple. The player whose turn it is rolls one of the dice (all are D6s) to determine how far they will move. Whoever the player is to their immediate right rolls the other normal die, plus the six-sided die with shades of green squares on all sides. The idea here is to determine which zombies will move on that turn. Zombies get turns after every player turn, but only the shade of undead that match the rolling result. As a way to keep players from playing favoritism towards their own piece, zombies must move towards the closest player at all times. It is a mob mentality after all. This just supports what people commonly think of how zombies will act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rolls keep playing out through the course of the game. There is only one action that supersedes movement rolls, and that is fighting. If a player or a zombie ever comes to occupy the same square on the board, combat must take place to resolve it. This could be in the middle of your movement or even at the start of a zombie’s. Combat is resolved in one of two fashions. The first is through the drawing of action cards that will determine the outcome. Sometimes the humans will be able to run away, sometimes they can kill a zombie, but they also risk the chance of becoming a zombie themselves. From playing, it does seem like there are more opportunities to get away than turning into a creature from beyond, but remember it is chance. The cards do have a wry sense of humor that makes the end result comical no matter the result. During one turn I was able to kill a zombie by kicking it. I thought that was pretty entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_651" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-cards/" rel="attachment wp-att-651"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Cards.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Cards" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-651" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The cards can play as terrible outcomes or humorous getaways. Who knew you could kick a zombie dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second option in getting away presents itself with the weapons scattered around the game board. Whenever you land on one of the spaces you occupy, you can pick the weapon up to use against a zombie should combat arise. Shovels,cricket bats and torches can be used one time to dispatch your brain hungry attacker in order to run away. Once used, they return to the board to have the chance to be used again. There is a more exclusive weapon, the coveted zombie slayer itself- the shotgun. If you were lucky enough to enter a store with batteries, a shotgun lies in wait. Be careful how you use it though. Once used it does not return to the board. You only get one shot to fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_652" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-store/" rel="attachment wp-att-652"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Store.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Store" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-652" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Getting to the store is only half the battle! Good thing for this player, the batteries and a well needed shotgun were inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do get turned by undead it doesn’t mean that you are out of the game. Being undead does have its perks in Oh No. After being nommed on, the player can replace their human player piece with the zombie piece of the same color. You retain your turn without interfering with the existing zombie turns, but with a slight difference. You are now out to eat the other players. The rules for moving a zombie are the same as when you started- you must move towards the closest player going to battle whenever you make contact. The great thing about being turned is you can still win the game as an undead player. All you need to do is be the actual zombie that eats the last man standing (sorry ladies, all the figures are men). Otherwise winning is just done by getting back to the shed with the batteries. Though, an interesting mechanic in that is you must roll exactly the number of spaces to get back in. None of this rolling over stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_655" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-winner/" rel="attachment wp-att-655"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Winner.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Winner" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-655" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This player was able to win with ease as the zombies were busy shambling after another player that had managed to find one of the stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the good in the game, there were a few bad things about it. In the copy that was provided to me, the playing board was severely warped. I don’t know if this was because of shipping or manufacturing, but the first few games did see some zombies falling over. It can be fixed though, so it isn’t a game breaking matter. The biggest issue of all was how quick the games could be. Depending on how you see this, this could be considered a win. Tabletop games to me are part of a greater culture that has people gather at the table, entertaining each other with the game being the tie that binds. While it does accomplish that, it doesn’t do so for long. Our first run was literally only a few minutes long. That brings me to the next point as well. Much like Steve Jackson Games&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;Cthulhu Dice&lt;/em&gt;, it is possible that there is no winner at the end of &lt;em&gt;Oh No…Zombies&lt;/em&gt;!. The original zombies can just chomp on everyone and simply end the game. You do have to balance odds you face when considering number of foes. I guess that could be a good reason for it to end fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_650" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-oh-no-zombies-tabletop/attachment/zombies-board-warp/" rel="attachment wp-att-650"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Zombies-Board-Warp.jpg" alt="Oh No...Zombies!, zombies, survival, shotgun, Thinkgeek, tabletop, Archie McPhee" title="Zombies-Board-Warp" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-650" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As you can see the board was clearly warped. Sad thing is, as it came out of the box like this, the other side had a mirrored flaw as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh No&amp;#8230;Zombies!&lt;/em&gt; is a game was will be easy for anyone to get into. If zombies were actually a &amp;#8220;thing&amp;#8221; that I could keep from gnawing at my skull for a short duration, I’m pretty sure that they would be able to play. I really won’t like to be the one to test the theory, but you get the idea. It might be a little offensive to them, but they are fictional so who cares. Come to think of it, is the politically correct term for zombies “life impaired?” At any rate, given a cost of $21.99 it isn’t that bad when considering how fun it is. The simple play and short list of rules will make it a game that anyone can get into. However, I do feel like the shortness of each played game will subtract some of that value for most players. Knocking $5.00 off the price would put it in a better range for most people to respond to. Though, you have to consider this isn’t a game you can exactly walk down to your local big box store and snag up either. There is usually nerd luxury taxes applied to these sorts of things. &lt;em&gt;Oh No…Zombies!&lt;/em&gt; is worth that little extra cost of admission. Especially if players are looking for something that everyone can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game provided by Thinkgeek.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You might be thinking to yourself, "Wait, did they jump from 43 to 45?" Yes, you'd be right. Episode 44 starring Tim Fields from Certain Affinity has been delayed.

                    <itunes:summary>We'll keep this one short and simple for the sake of all our lives in this hectic part of the year. You might be thinking to yourself, "Wait, did they jump from 43 to 45?" Yes, you'd be right. Episode 44 starring Tim Fields from Certain Affinity has been delayed. We could blame a combined assault by Krampus and other evil 2011-based spirits, but the truth is much more mundane. We'll address it when episode 44 actually goes live. Our last episode of our inaugural season is here for you to listen to! Guest starring Mr. Meyagi and Leetum, broadcasting from an undisclosed location, we cover the Penny Arcade/Ocean Marketing drama, a nephew's terrible Best Buy trade-in experience, the "new" Wii lack of Gamecube controller plugs, and Draeno's and our guests' thoughts on Star Wars: The Old Republic.

As gamers, sometimes we just want something to kick back with that doesn’t involve tedious strategy or the competition of shooters. Every now and then we need something that allows us to cool off, but still be entertained. For some it could be a simple puzzle game like &lt;em&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/em&gt;. Others will kick back and hit some flash games to pass a few minutes. What do I like to do when I get to that point? I love to throw in a racing game. Something about them clears my mind and brings on a sense of calm. Plus, who doesn’t love a good looking car? Generally I’ll stick to a car racing game of sorts, but recently &lt;a href="http://www.digitalreality.eu/"&gt;Digital Reality&lt;/a&gt; put out an interesting title that I thought was just different enough. Swap cars for planes. Race others around on tracks. Blow up the competition if they get in your way. Add those up and you get &lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-639"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you thinking that &lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt; is nothing more than a racing/exploding airplane game, I have some news for you. It’s a little more than that. With three racing modes (speed, elimination and power) in single player, each stage you play gives you a little variety in what you need to pole at in order to move on to the next. In speed mode, rings are placed in sequences around the track that you need to use to maximize your speed. Elimination puts you at odds with others around you as when the timer reaches zero the last place flyer meets an unfortunate end. Power gives you the guts of the game. You get to fly over power ups, defensive and offensive, in order to dogfight your way to first place. Think of it as a more grown up version of tossing turtle shells at others in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;. Another interesting piece is that there are eight planes to race with that you unlock as you progress. Each has a different strength or weakness be it the ability to fend off more gunfire, hit higher top speeds or have gross power in the afterburner department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_642" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-skydrift-pc/attachment/skydrift-speed-blur/" rel="attachment wp-att-642"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Skydrift-Speed-Blur.jpg" alt="SkyDrift, Digital Reality, racing, planes, jets, rockets, Moto Racer, Daytona USA, Crusin&amp;#039;, arcade" title="Skydrift-Speed-Blur" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-642" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Speed is key in all aspects of SkyDrift. The real fun of controlling a plane begins when you go super sonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt; really hit a sweet sport for me when it came to presentation. I don’t know what it is, but I have always loved racing games that have an arcade feel. Be it the SEGA games of old like &lt;em&gt;Daytona USA&lt;/em&gt; or even the mass of &lt;em&gt;Crusin&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt; games, the look and feel made me take them in non-serious manners. For this style of game it is a great mindset to have. It is quick to jump into and easy to play. The graphics are slightly cartoony and shiny, but create unique takes on what you’d expect to see in reality. The planes in &lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt; are a great example of this with their outlandish paint jobs and multiple wing layouts. Some planes even have both jet propulsion and propellers. The great part about &lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt; is that it keeps you pumping as you pull through the twists and pulls with your plane of choice. It really reminds me of how &lt;em&gt;Moto Racer&lt;/em&gt; felt for me as a kid. I don’t even remember the hours I logged in that game. You know, minus shooting rockets at other racers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_643" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-skydrift-pc/attachment/skydrift-stunts/" rel="attachment wp-att-643"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Skydrift-Stunts.jpg" alt="SkyDrift, Digital Reality, racing, planes, jets, rockets, Moto Racer, Daytona USA, Crusin&amp;#039;, arcade" title="Skydrift-Stunts" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-643" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stunts are also another important part of your success. As you complete more skills such as overtaking, drifting or hugging the ground, your meter for speed boosting energy grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some problems with the game that were hard for me get over at first. Mostly, the default keyboard controls bothered me quite a bit. The Xbox 360 origins of the title are clearly there so if you do have a wired Xbox controller, it will allow you to use it. I highly recommend that you go the controller method. While it is perfectly possible to play that game with just the keyboard, trying to navigate with tighter turns and maintaining basic controls while maneuvering while using boost is troublesome at best. Invisible walls don’t help either. If you turn late and try to roll to the sky in order to keep off the walls, you are promptly shoved back into the “track.” This generally results in a crash anyway as you were still trying to fly out of it in the first place. Then there is the length and re-playability of the game. While I can personally get miles out of a title like this, the average gamer will dump it after finishing the campaign. After 33 races, I can see that being a stopping point since the play is rather repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_644" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-skydrift-pc/attachment/skydrift-waiting/" rel="attachment wp-att-644"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Skydrift-Waiting.jpg" alt="SkyDrift, Digital Reality, racing, planes, jets, rockets, Moto Racer, Daytona USA, Crusin&amp;#039;, arcade" title="Skydrift-Waiting" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-644" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trying to play multiplayer matches turned up a lot of situations like this. People that want to try it out, but end up leaving their computer after being frustrated by the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn’t to say there isn’t a few more options for the game. Multiplayer is available to pit you against other wannabe pilots. Problem is, you really can’t tell the difference than if you were playing the single player racers. Without a new experience players are left shrugging off the multiplayer. Creating a situation where you potentially burn out your gaming audience before even getting to the player versus player battles leaves the queues empty. However, there were two DLC packs put out to help ease the problem. The first, the Gladiator Pack, introduced deathmatch and team deathmatch modes into the multiplayer. With this, six new arenas were introduced to go head to head with your sky ace rivals. They are off course based off of the existing maps in the game, as is standard for multiplayer spaces these days. It is worth noting that these modes are only available in multiplayer. Digital Reality did wise up a bit and give players a reason to step back into the head to head portion. The second pack dubbed the Extreme Fighters Pack, added three new planes that are unlocked to use in any race. The Vanguard, Sparrow X1, and Triwing Vintage are actually some of the more fun planes to race with, so kudos to the developer for putting those out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_640" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-skydrift-pc/attachment/skydrift-dlc-planes/" rel="attachment wp-att-640"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Skydrift-DLC-Planes.jpg" alt="SkyDrift, Digital Reality, racing, planes, jets, rockets, Moto Racer, Daytona USA, Crusin&amp;#039;, arcade" title="Skydrift DLC Planes" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Extreme Fighters DLC added easily the most enjoyable planes to pilot. Now if they would have included a tower to buzz&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take stock of all the time you spend in the skies, you’ll look at it in a very polarizing manner. Either you will have fun just racing around and chasing down other planes, or you’ll curse the game for being so simple and short. The perk of the PC version of the game in that regard is the price tag. At a cost of $9.99 ($6.69 on Steam currently) vs. 1200 MS points, the sting can be reduced a bit if you purchase it on Steam rather than Xbox Live. The player will have to determine if the cost savings is actually worth it though. Personally while I prefer most things on PC, the lack of players on Steam in multi modes is a huge issue. I acknowledge that it is a problem of the platform. The DLC prices are low ($2.99 vs 400MS points for the Gladiator Pack and $1.49 vs 160 MS points for the Fighter Pack), but if you aren’t going to be able to play with others purchasing one of those doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Giving a recommendation on this title is a rather touchy thing to do. My gut says to bite the bullet as I had a lot of fun with &lt;em&gt;SkyDrift&lt;/em&gt;. It looks great and didn’t give me one bit of trouble ever being able to just jump into it. If you like a simple, fast paced racer that gives you the bonus of mowing down your fellow flyers, you will love every minute of it. If not, I hear there is a major American pizza chain that will sell you a pie for as much as you’ll spend here.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Without add on software, Mac OSX users were out of luck streaming media to the xBox or DLNA devices. &lt;a href="http://www.yazsoft.com" target="_blank"&gt;Yazsoft&lt;/a&gt; has a solution for this dilemma in &lt;a href="http://www.yazsoft.com/products/playback/" target="_blank"&gt;Playback&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-playback-for-osx/attachment/playback-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-634"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/playback-banner.jpg" alt="Playback, Yazsoft, Mac, Apple, Xbox 360, PS3, transcoding, H.264" title="playback-banner" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-634" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, video streaming in the home has become a bit easier. Not all that long ago it was a mishmash of applications, transcoders, and frustration. There have been a few products and software packages to facilitate watching video on assorted and sundry home devices, &lt;em&gt;AppleTV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Roku&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GoogleTV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20son-review-stream-to-me-iapp-and-server/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stream To Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Airplay&lt;/em&gt; just to name a few. Some out of the box solutions are available as well, such as Windows Media Server to the xBox 360 or other DLNA devices. Without add on software, Mac OSX users were out of luck streaming media to the xBox or DLNA devices. &lt;a href="http://www.yazsoft.com" target="_blank"&gt;Yazsoft&lt;/a&gt; has a solution for this dilemma in &lt;a href="http://www.yazsoft.com/products/playback/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-625"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt; is a small, lightweight application that runs quietly in the background. If you&amp;#8217;re sharing the videos that lurk in your iTunes library, it&amp;#8217;s two-click simplicity. Alternatively, if you&amp;#8217;d rather share a folder of videos, photos, or music, that&amp;#8217;s pretty simple too. Click once to enable this feature, then navigate to the folders in question using standard OSX GUI conventions. Simple. Any DRM restricted files won&amp;#8217;t play using &lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt;, naturally. That&amp;#8217;s not a limitation of the software, but rather the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_628" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-playback-for-osx/attachment/main-config/" rel="attachment wp-att-628"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/main-config.png" alt="Playback, Yazsoft, Mac, Apple, Xbox 360, PS3, transcoding, H.264" title="main config" width="506" height="388" class="size-full wp-image-628" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As you can see, Playback offers a straight forward user interface that anyone looking to stream videos at this level should understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the heavy lifting is done underneath the hood. It doesn&amp;#8217;t really do any transcoding. Instead &lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt; repackages existing video without transcoding so it&amp;#8217;s compatible and quickly available to the device that it&amp;#8217;s going to be played on. As such, there are periodic compatibility issues. For instance, movies with a file size of over 4 gigabytes in size won&amp;#8217;t play on the xBox 360 because of a 32 bit storage address limitation on the console. Nor will H.264 video work with any other audio selection that isn&amp;#8217;t simple stereo. Simply, 5.1 and 7.1 audio mixes aren&amp;#8217;t supported by the uPnP H.264 video playback codec on the xBox 360. I&amp;#8217;m not sure there&amp;#8217;s a technical reason for this, but rather apathy. The Microsoft xBox codec available on xBox Live hasn&amp;#8217;t been updated since 2007. I can think of no reason why the codec shouldn&amp;#8217;t technically support it as the xBox itself supports surround sound in hardware. In fact, videos in the marketplace can be purchased that have 5.1 and 7.1 mixes. Neither the file size nor the audio mix limitations apply to other DLNA devices that we were able to test such as the Playstation 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_629" style="width: 506px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-playback-for-osx/attachment/video-sharing/" rel="attachment wp-att-629"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/video-sharing.png" alt="Playback, Yazsoft, Mac, Apple, Xbox 360, PS3, transcoding, H.264" title="video sharing" width="496" height="519" class="size-full wp-image-629" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Most of the options you should need for a home theatre situation should be covered for streaming options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt; does one thing and it does it well. Any limitations to the software are more a function of the playback hardware rather than the software. What you serve to your DLNA device using Playback effectively depends on what hardware you&amp;#8217;re using to display it with. This even extends to whether or not you&amp;#8217;re willing to transcode video that doesn&amp;#8217;t comply using &lt;em&gt;Handbrake&lt;/em&gt; or other such tool. At $15, it&amp;#8217;s a decent deal if you need the functionality. It is the right tool for the right job after all. At press time, Yazsoft has two promotions running- if you just buy &lt;em&gt;Playback&lt;/em&gt;, you get two other utilities free. Alternatively, they have a December &lt;a href="http://store.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=7NT_LIVE"&gt;Megabundle&lt;/a&gt; sale running where you get multiple licenses for just about all of their software for use or for gifting including the very useful Sharetool 2. If you&amp;#8217;re using a Playstation 3 or other device listed on the Yazsoft compatibility list other than the xBox 360, it&amp;#8217;ll handle just about anything you want to toss at it smoothly. Large files, or files with surround audio, don&amp;#8217;t stream will to the xBox 360. Again, that&amp;#8217;s not the fault of the software. If you stick with using .AVI files on a xBox 360, then you&amp;#8217;re set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application provided by developer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Syba has a PCI (not -X or -E) card called the SD-SATA2-2E2I. Positioned as a budget card, is it a wise purchase or should you spend the $35 or so on a newer machine?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-syba-sd-sata2-2e2i-pci-card/attachment/syba-banner-20/" rel="attachment wp-att-630"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Syba-banner-20.jpg" alt="" title="Syba-banner-20" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-630" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While old PCs don&amp;#8217;t have feelings of despair when they are replaced by newer gear, even machines nearly a decade old can have some utility. Sometimes, there&amp;#8217;s issues with the chipsets, only allowing 128 gig or smaller drives (LBA48 compliance). Other times, even with LBA48 support, only Parallel ATA drives can be installed natively. At first glance, this may be a deal breaker for resuscitating older hardware. This doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be the case. &lt;a href="http://www.syba.com/index.php?controller=Default&amp;#038;action=En"&gt;Syba&lt;/a&gt; has a PCI (not -X or -E) card called the SD-SATA2-2E2I. Positioned as a budget card, is it a wise purchase or should you spend the $35 or so on a newer machine?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-621"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
SATA is the (current) wave of the future as the replacement for PATA. If the benefits were just limited to fewer individual conductors per cable, much higher peak data rates, and reduced cost SATA would be the clear choice. With the addition of the E-SATA (External Serial ATA) protocol, overall the SATA protocol is plainly superior to even casual observers. The 2E2I card has two internal SATA ports, as well as two E-SATA ports, allowing for ease of both internal and external applications. When utilizing an older piece of hardware, this allows for two large capacity internal drives as well as some RAID cases, allowing a truly tremendous amount of drives to be added for applications like a home media or backup server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_632" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-syba-sd-sata2-2e2i-pci-card/attachment/2e2iunboxed/" rel="attachment wp-att-632"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/2e2iunboxed.jpg" alt="" title="2e2iunboxed" width="700" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-632" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The 2E2I in all its unboxed glory. Were you expecting much else for a SATA card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran some tests on the 2E2I card on newer and legacy hardware to determine it&amp;#8217;s applicability for older hardware as well as some slightly newer equipment. A Pentium 4 2.4 gigahertz system running Windows XP was used for the older hardware. A Core 2 Quad 9550 system running under Windows Vista, OSX, and Gentoo Linux was also utilized for testing. This card isn&amp;#8217;t intended for high-end utilization or RAID subsystems for speed, rather it seems positioned for inexpensive data warehousing. After a little bit of BIOS fiddling (specifically, setting the PCI clock rate for 33 MHz), the drives popped up immediately for formatting under Windows XP. Transfer speeds seemed limited to SATA I speeds and peaked at about 44 megabytes per second, rather than coming close to the advertised SATA II speeds. Windows XP will either migrate or be installed on a drive installed using the card as an interface, but won&amp;#8217;t boot the OS. As I mentioned before, perfect for a data warehouse on an older machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the card was moved to the Windows Vista system, the card wasn&amp;#8217;t immediately recognized by the operating system. After flashing the card to a newer firmware revision, the drives were spotted by the hardware wizard and installation completed normally. On the newer machine, speeds exceeded the SATA I max theoretical speed routinely, and came within 30% of the peak theoretical SATA II speeds in bursts. This suggests that the data transfer on the older system was either CPU or bus-limited. When two drives were installed in a striped RAID configuration (RAID 0), the transfer speeds didn&amp;#8217;t increase, suggesting a bus speed data transfer limitation from the 33mhz vanilla PCI bus. It is important to note that if you have a PCI-X system, installing a vanilla PCI card will slow down the entire bus, which may be a problem depending on your hardware expansion needs. Both Vista and Linux machines booted from a clean install on a drive using the card as the interface. Migrated existing OS installs weren&amp;#8217;t tested, but I see no reason why they wouldn&amp;#8217;t work, given that the fresh OS install did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no native support under OSX of any flavor for this card. The system profiler will see a card freshly installed, but have no idea what the card is. The 2E2I card is a 3124-2 Silicon Image chipset based card. It adheres to the reference design closely enough that the chipset manufacturer has OSX drivers available all the way back to server X.3.9 and client X.4. In theory, you can install this card in a 5 volt PCI G4 based machine like the Mirrored Drive Door or xServe G4 running X.4 or X.5. However, our rather limited testing lab has no fully functioning machines of that vintage to test and be certain of the results. OSX wouldn&amp;#8217;t install on a drive installed through this card, and a migrated OSX install kernel panicked the machine. The vendor has no official support for this card in an OSX machine, so proceed at your own peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External SATA implementation is good. The card supports port multiplication, allowing for external RAID cases to be utilized with no issues. Hotswapping was tried with both single drive external cases, as well as RAID cases with four drives installed. Windows XP didn&amp;#8217;t care for the hot swap very much. We saw a couple of blue screens of death, but importantly not every time. More so no data was lost. Windows Vista and Gentoo Linux did very well with the hot swap. Not surprisingly, since the OSX driver wasn&amp;#8217;t written by the vendor, the test machine booted under OSX didn&amp;#8217;t perform perfectly during the hot swap test. While the OS didn&amp;#8217;t crash, both the RAID case and single drive refused to mount on the system after removal. Again, no data was lost. Following a reboot, both external drive cases mounted fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_623" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-syba-sd-sata2-2e2i-pci-card/attachment/2e2iclearance/" rel="attachment wp-att-623"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/2e2iclearance.jpg" alt="SYBA, 2E2I, clearance, SATA" title="2e2iclearance" width="700" height="452" class="size-full wp-image-623" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Note the tight clearance here.  This is worst case, another case I had had very slight improvement over this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a physical standpoint, I did have two minor problems with the card. As shipped, the metal bracket wasn&amp;#8217;t quite the right shape for either case I had to test it in. Some minor bending with a pair of needle nose pliers fixed the problem. More problematic was the location of the E-SATA ports- they were far too close to the edge of the card and there was some obstruction when inserting one particular E-SATA cable with a seemingly short plastic tab. Another cable I had with a slightly longer plastic tab was easier to insert and connection was made reliably. If the E-SATA ports were closer to the center of the card this wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been an issue. Either of these issues aren&amp;#8217;t show-stoppers. Frankly, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever installed PCI cards before then this kind of manipulation probably isn&amp;#8217;t that foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SYBA SATA2-2E2I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be considered a replacement for a high end PCI-E card, or even onboard SATA2 ports. RAID performance isn&amp;#8217;t fantastic, but is ideal for data storage or even a RAID 1 or 5 backup solution with or without parity. The retail price on this card is $54.99, but at the time of this writing, it&amp;#8217;s available at Amazon.com for $39.99 and at Newegg for $52.99. We&amp;#8217;re not Tom&amp;#8217;s Hardware- we aren&amp;#8217;t going to give you a hard number saying how fast or slow the card is- we review hardware the same way we review other products. Our reviews will tell you what the device is good for and what it isn&amp;#8217;t. There are cheaper SATA cards available, but few with the Silicon Image chipset. This card won&amp;#8217;t turn a five year old machine into an uncompressed video editing powerhouse, nor a speed demon. It&amp;#8217;s fantastic for a media server for something like a Roku box or an AppleTV, redundant storage, or just packing a older machine with storage well in excess of what it was originally intended to hold for whatever purpose you may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card provided by manufacturer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>As researcher for the GLaDOS development team, I would like to think that she was misunderstood. Thankfully after years on the shelf, the GLaDOS project received another chance. An order came from high up to transfer the project to &lt;a href="http://www.hiddenpath.com/"&gt;Hidden Path Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid their new development of &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid: You Monster&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

&lt;span id="more-609"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a former employee of &lt;a href="http://www.aperturescience.com/"&gt;Aperture Science&lt;/a&gt;, I never understood the contempt that ex-test subjects had for our AI &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLaDOS"&gt;GLaDOS&lt;/a&gt;. There might have been a few flaws in her programming that lead to some unfortunate accidents, but what piece of software doesn’t have a few bugs to work out? As researcher for the GLaDOS development team, I would like to think that she was misunderstood. She knew that in order to push the limits of our volunteers, sacrifices had to be made. It just so happened that most of those “sacrifices” happened to be the test subjects. Sure they tried to tell us that “she was crazy” or that “it was trying to kill them,” but this is a high stress environment. The team came to the conclusion that it might merely have occurred because she was out of her intended element. Thankfully, the order came from high up to transfer the project to &lt;a href="http://www.hiddenpath.com/"&gt;Hidden Path Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the new wing of their &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; initiative. After the unmitigated disaster of our last round with the AI, we were happy for another chance with &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid: You Monster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_616" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-defense-grid-you-monster-pc/attachment/defense-ym-unwinnable/" rel="attachment wp-att-616"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Defense-YM-Unwinnable.jpg" alt="Defense Grid, You Monster, Hidden Path Entertainment, GLaDOS, Valve, tower defense, testing," title="Defense-YM-Unwinnable" width="680" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-616" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In typical GLaDOS fashion, sometimes the things that she throws at you are just not winnable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our parent company, &lt;a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt;, leased GLaDOS out to be part of a new testing facility under &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; simulator codenamed &lt;em&gt;You Monster&lt;/em&gt;. As the old reliable AI, Entity, wasn’t providing enough challenge for the expectations of the shareholders, an outside team (my own) was brought aboard shortly after the project was launched. In fact it was a little awkward as we started to replace the existing team while a subject was in the middle of their testing run. Rather than let them know, we just kept on with our install and tried quietly to replace Entity with GLaDOS. For those who are not acquainted with the great strives that the team behind &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; has accomplish, I’ll fill you in a little as to why their work was so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_614" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-defense-grid-you-monster-pc/attachment/defense-ym-insult/" rel="attachment wp-att-614"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Defense-YM-Insult.jpg" alt="Defense Grid, You Monster, Hidden Path Entertainment, GLaDOS, Valve, tower defense, testing," title="Defense-YM-Insult" width="680" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-614" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It just wouldn&amp;#039;t be the same if GLaDOS wasn&amp;#039;t there to insult you ever step of the way. Don&amp;#039;t let her hurt your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; is an initiative based on protecting assets to ward off offensive agents from XF3125. Originally developed as an entertainment simulator to the people of the 21st century, the idea of the game was to protect the last remaining resources of a war torn world from alien invasion. These remaining resources or power cores remained in order to power the grid, but were endangered from the invasion forces coming back to claim them. The player’s job was to build a series of towers to exterminate these forces as they came to steal the power cores. Towers like machine gun to lightly chip away at passing aliens or concussion grenades to damage and disorient. Through strategy and cunning, the tester is gradually inserted into an escalating scenario in which he or she will be able to fend off the masses by placement and firepower. The intelligence was as accurate as could be, which turned out a rather difficult setting. Due to the success of the game, it was looked into for viability in a military setting. It would be launched later as part of a long distance space reconnaissance mission and developed into a full-fledged defensive platform in 4092.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_613" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-defense-grid-you-monster-pc/attachment/defense-ym-mocking/" rel="attachment wp-att-613"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Defense-YM-Mocking.jpg" alt="Defense Grid, You Monster, Hidden Path Entertainment, GLaDOS, Valve, tower defense, testing," title="Defense-YM-Mocking" width="680" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-613" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The AI will throw things at you at every turn. The new map designs make it a challenge to keep up with it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of all of this is that GLaDOS fell right into place with the program. Her humor was a good way to ease the existing test candidate into the new simulations. That was of course until she started to take the testing rooms as more than just what they were meant to be. There was great pride in creating Aperture labs that shared the same aesthetics and textures again in the new facility. The thought behind it was to help to keep GLaDOS in a familiar environment as to not shellshock her with new surroundings. The team did however take an opportunity to improve upon the towers and test subject’s interface used in each mission, and in turn all of the older products in the &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; catalog. The changes were subtitle, but helped create a more polished look. As the finishing touches took place on all the pieces, it looked right at home with the existing assets. Most importantly the unparalleled intelligence of GLaDOS offered an extraordinary new take on what it has in store for any volunteer that dares to step up to the challenge. To say she has a few surprises appears to be a gross understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_612" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-defense-grid-you-monster-pc/attachment/defense-ym-graphics/" rel="attachment wp-att-612"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Defense-YM-Graphics.jpg" alt="Defense Grid, You Monster, Hidden Path Entertainment, GLaDOS, Valve, tower defense, testing," title="Defense-YM-Graphics" width="680" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-612" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphics in the test chambers have been updated along with the aliens, but something looks very familiar about them..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there were steps that could have taken to make the trial a tad less forceful of the endeavor overall. GLaDOS has a personality that takes some time to warm up to. In only eight different testing scenarios that scale upwards in difficulty, you not only get her heartwarming personality to interact with over the duration, but also her full intellectual might. The idea behind adding her to the simulation was to use clone commanders in specific situations to result in no actual loss of human life. However, all tests came to the same conclusion. It doesn’t matter if it is a clone or an actual person going up against the system, the play of the &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; is exactly the same as it was before, only kicked up a few notches. Further testing would conclude that the level of difficultly would exceed what a clone could process therefore human subjects would have to remain. Comment cards indicated by the undamaged subjects that the testing did present itself as more tedious. To read the comments from one such card stated, “There was flair to the new facilities for You Monster, but in the end it was the same old thing. The only thing that added to the experience was that damn voice that kept trying to kill me. Seriously, why did you put me in a room with that thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_617" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-defense-grid-you-monster-pc/attachment/defense-ym-too-far/" rel="attachment wp-att-617"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Defense-YM-Too-Far.jpg" alt="Defense Grid, You Monster, Hidden Path Entertainment, GLaDOS, Valve, tower defense, testing," title="Defense-YM-Too-Far" width="680" height="425" class="size-full wp-image-617" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It seems that the testing might have gone a little to far at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve witnessed in &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; testing, it appears to have meshed very well with GLaDOS’ personality. While she still has some of the bugs to work out and presents some of the same personality issues that folks may consider “aggressive” or “borderline sadistic” I still think that she is undervalued. I will say that perhaps it may have been best if we had only made an add-on to the 21st century entertainment game to be sold to the general public. &lt;em&gt;You Monster&lt;/em&gt; ideally would have been be released as a downloadable content (or DLC) addition I’m told. Something around $4.99 would have been an appropriate price considering the economic times. There did seem to be an abundance of these “tower defense” entertainment simulators, but the &lt;em&gt;You Monster&lt;/em&gt; DLC would have only strengthened the value of the &lt;em&gt;Defense Grid&lt;/em&gt; game. Sadly, I don&amp;#8217;t know if we could have conveyed the complexities of what we&amp;#8217;ve accomplished in this timeline. It may have been simply more of the same. Even worse, GLaDOS may not have lived up to her potential. Sure, GLaDOS might have accidentally included real aliens that might endanger the colony planet in the case that things weren’t handled properly. I just think it was a small oversight. Stop overreacting about it already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is my professional opinion that w…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;CORRUPTION IN DATA FILE DETECTED&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8212;SWITCHING TO AUDIO LOG FOR CONLUSION&amp;#8212;&lt;br /&gt;

                    <description>Since release, &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; has had a strong grip on my household. However, there comes a time when players have to evaluate what the want to play. With &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; coming out, we had such a decision. While the die was cast against &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt;, there were a lot of the things &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion&lt;/a&gt; did right with it. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fronttowardsgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/trionlogo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-41658 alignright" src="http://fronttowardsgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/trionlogo.jpg" alt="Trion, MMO, developers, customer service, Rift" width="300" height="100" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere gamers turn there are different massively multiplayer games attempting to grab our attention and hold it. From the realms of free to play titles to the more costly pay per month models that we’ve been more accustomed to, with each new game comes a choice- either stand by your tried and true tested or give the new one catching your eye a chance. Sometimes the loser of the battle for time just has to be the game that you’ve put some significant effort into. It would be nice to play them all, but it just isn’t financially viable to do so in all cases. Recently for my household, the die of fate was cast bringing our time in &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; to a close in favor of the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;. Being the nerd that I am, there is a gravity well that surrounds anything &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; that just draws me in. I fell for it with &lt;em&gt;Galaxies&lt;/em&gt;, but here I go again potentially repeating my mistake. With the bulk of my friends heading to the game, it makes it hard to say no. &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; made one hell of a case though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-605"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since March, &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; has had a strong grip on my household. Having tinkered with it at &lt;a href="http://prime.paxsite.com/"&gt;PAX 10&lt;/a&gt; a bit, I didn’t walk away feeling that impressed. However, once my significant other started getting into the game, I started to notice just what was trying to be accomplished. It became a struggle for me to keep my distance from it as I was trying to stay away from another stint in an MMO. &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; managed to reel me in as I eventually succumbed to purchasing the collector’s edition. I even sprung for larger payment chunks instead of the month to month buy in that&amp;#8217;s my normal modus operandi. Both of us would go on to inspire others to play with the tales of how fun the game was and the new experiences it brought. She would go on to level four characters to the level cap, with one achieving rank eight PvP level. I would meddle about playing all the classes, but never having the time to max any of them out. The urge to come back and play in spite of my other responsibilities kept me at the game even if it was only for an hour here or there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the point of all of this, &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion&lt;/a&gt; sold me on &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; from launch. What I didn’t intend to see was how they strove to create and keep new players in the crowded online scene. Out of the gate &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; had a strong PR push. It seemed like most places I would turn would have some sort of banner, background or ad promoting the game. It didn’t stop there either. In a move that would appeal to the &lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; haters, TV ads were created calling out &lt;a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Azeroth"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Little things here and there tried to keep the title on the tips of potential players’ tongues. Things only got bigger and bigger over time. Moving from free to play weekends, quick price drops, perks for inviting friends to play and even free trials pretty soon, it was clear that Trion was putting their faith behind the title. And for good reason. The content was there to support the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YMTp38tG3zA" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the players there was only part of the game though. Keeping them there was a whole different thing entirely. Trion was pulling this off through the numerous events and content that it was providing. World events took place constantly that would add bonus quests and tasks for players to do. Specific rewards for each event would even help the casual player fill gaps that would usually take raiding to accomplish. Even better, content was being added to the game constantly for no additional fee. How many times can that be said for an MMO? Trion recognized that they had to compete not only with the big dogs, but also with the up and coming free to play games. Doling out everything they could, they reached over a million subscriptions. A significant portion of that was drawn from the biggest dog, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, if you are to believe what Trion claims as well as &lt;a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/?-"&gt;Blizzard&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; quarterly reports. I think the biggest success of all for the company was their customer service. Triton has done everything they can to respect their player base and that will go far in this industry. When closing out accounts, I was greeted with an e-mail that I didn’t expect. For me the following this sums up just how far Trion is going to go to be stand up with their players:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We&amp;#8217;re sorry to see that you&amp;#8217;ve recently canceled your RIFT subscription because you couldn&amp;#8217;t find people to play with. We understand that RIFT is a social game, and that it&amp;#8217;s more fun to have your friends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please accept this complimentary thirty day game time code which you and 5 of your friends can use to check out our most recent update &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;RIFT 1.6: From the Embers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you and your friends in Telara soon!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with this, I still have to wave goodbye to &lt;a href="http://telarapedia.com/wiki/Telara"&gt;Telara&lt;/a&gt;. Fear not, because in reality I don’t think it will be the last time we’ll meet. Trion has done far too much to earn my respect with their outstanding dedication to making &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; perfect and respecting their players. Actions that the developer has taken to work with consumers, especially with things like the above e-mail, just go to show that building a brand is better than doing it for the money. That is certainly a rarity in this world. For now, despite my love for you, &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt;, you should go out and meet other people. There are plenty of others out there that will like you for who you are. I have no doubt that you will continue to have a long, fruitful life. Don’t worry though, this isn’t goodbye for you and I- only see you later.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;a href="http://www.dynamite.net/htmlfiles/"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.topcow.com/"&gt;Top Cow Productions&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up in 2012 to bring forth a crossover that pairs two staples from their studios into one comic. Look forward to &lt;em&gt;WitchBlade/Red Sonja&lt;/em&gt; #1 to be hitting your favorite comic outlet in February 2012. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/witchblade-red-sonja-crossover-to-hit-shelves-february-2012/attachment/witchblade-red-sonja-cover/" rel="attachment wp-att-590"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Witchblade-Red-Sonja-Cover.jpg" alt="Witchblade, Red Sonja, comics, crossover, Top Cow, Dynamite" title="Witchblade Red Sonja Cover" width="333" height="500" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-590" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dynamite.net/htmlfiles/"&gt;Dynamite Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.topcow.com/"&gt;Top Cow Productions&lt;/a&gt; are teaming up in 2012 to bring forth a crossover that pairs two staples from their studios into one comic. Look forward to &lt;em&gt;WitchBlade/Red Sonja&lt;/em&gt; #1 to be hitting your favorite comic outlet in February 2012. With it comes the promise of something different that your typical cross over. Instead of combining two title characters to do nothing other than fight, writer Doug Wagner is bringing a more engrossing story to the book. The comic will instead put the two female leads together in a fight for humanity in their own ages, but connected over the vast difference in time. For either to fail could result in dire consequences for the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wagner states, “There&amp;#8217;s no time traveling, no merging of universes, no soul swapping, and no messages in a bottle. The first issue won&amp;#8217;t have the two heroes fighting against each other until they figure out who the real villain is. If that&amp;#8217;s what you&amp;#8217;re here for, you&amp;#8217;ve come to the wrong place. &lt;em&gt;WitchBlade/Red Sonja&lt;/em&gt; #1 is the beginning of a grisly trial for both characters. Red Sonja and Sara Pezzini are about to plummet into despair and hopelessness, both physically and emotionally. Their beliefs and courage will be tested, and it will take more than just either heroine brandishing their fabled weapons to overcome this threat. Humanity as they know it is at risk. And if one fails, they both fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be interesting to see how these two characters are brought together. Being from completely different eras of time, Sara Pezzini of modern times and Red Sonja of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyborian_Age"&gt;Hyborian Age&lt;/a&gt; makes this an interesting crossover to put together. The promise to drive the characters to the dark side of emotion and physical torment does have an interesting feel. In an interview with &lt;a href="http://www.comicvine.com/news/witchbladered-sonja-interview-with-doug-wagner/143960/"&gt;Comicvine&lt;/a&gt;, Doug Wagner teases that they are fighting a common foe, but that each character is doing it in their own period in time. That gives a whole ‘nother layer of complexity that should be ripe for some good writing. Hopefully this crossover only helps draw attention to both characters in their respective comics if only to bring more attention to the content rather than their looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://www.dynamite.net/htmlfiles/pressrelshow.html?display=PR11091130351"&gt;Dynamite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More political wrangling by turkey necks fires up your hosts again this week. Watch in amazement as Emdee and Draeno rail against the SOPA hearings last week (which are beginning again this week, oddly)! Gasp in shock as political reform is tossed about! Shudder with delight as we discuss the &lt;a href="http://www.orangeopc.com/"&gt;Orange OLPC amp&lt;/a&gt;! Squeal with glee as Draeno discusses his newest home decoration project! Giggle with mirth as we discuss Draeno&amp;#8217;s home state and a lightsaber assault in a Toys R Us! Exclaim great horror with us as we decry the &lt;em&gt;Evil Dead&lt;/em&gt; remake!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s more, but I&amp;#8217;m out of good verb/adjective combos. We also talk about &lt;a href="http://www.pvponline.com/"&gt;Scott Kurtz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/"&gt;Brad Guigar&lt;/a&gt; and their consultant initiative, Megaupload and random takedowns, and &lt;a href="http://www.mojang.com/"&gt;Mojang&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cobalt&lt;/em&gt;. Only one more podcast to be posted before 2011 comes to a close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Never mind the fact that 20th Century Fox grossed &lt;a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=riseoftheapes.htm"&gt;$481 million&lt;/a&gt; dollars with a prequel of a film our generation probably didn’t find relevant. Instead, let’s look at what it took to bring in that cash- the stellar acting of a primate. Through his eyes, we saw the birth of a revolution and the fall of a civilization. Eyes that oddly enough, have a strange human quality to them. Not because of any script or digital manipulation, but because there was actually a man behind the ape. I’m talking about none other than motion capture artist extraordinaire &lt;a href="http://www.serkis.com/"&gt;Andy Serkis&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Never mind the fact that 20th Century Fox grossed &lt;a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=riseoftheapes.htm"&gt;$481 million&lt;/a&gt; dollars with a prequel of a film our generation probably didn’t find relevant. Instead, let’s look at what it took to bring in that cash- the stellar acting of a primate. Through his eyes, we saw the birth of a revolution and the fall of a civilization. Eyes that oddly enough, have a strange human quality to them. Not because of any script or digital manipulation, but because there was actually a man behind the ape. I’m talking about none other than motion capture artist extraordinaire &lt;a href="http://www.serkis.com/"&gt;Andy Serkis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-596"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Serkis, for those unacquainted with the name, first came to our eyes through the vile, transformed hobbit know as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum"&gt;Gollum&lt;/a&gt;. Since then Serkis has gone on to be the go to man for action in front of the green screen. When it came to building a strong base to work upon for a primate to develop a hatred of humanity, there was no one else to turn to. Fortunately for Serkis, that turned into big bucks for him once Fox claimed it a winner for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nothing has been set in stone for the next installment of &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, Serkis was the first to be solidified when assembling the pieces. Agreeing to a salary in the range of seven figures, it became clear just how important he was to the studio. While the producers, writers and director had already signed into a contract for another film, Serkis had only signed on for the first flick. Incredibly smart move on his part as the film could have just as easily turned into a massive flop. Instead, on the back of his performance, he was able to have firm ground to stand on when negotiations started. Serkis is no doubt worth whatever fee he is asking for if for his flexibility to mold the illusion of another through his mannerisms. Hopefully he’ll continue to pave the way for this to become a standard for performances in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you had enough of &lt;a href="http://www.stephenking.com/index.html"&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt; media projects flying around lately? No? Well that’s good because it looks like &lt;a href="http://www.sho.com/site/index.html"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; is throwing another our way. DreamWorks will be producing the adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Under the Dome&lt;/em&gt; from book to TV for the cable channel. The acquisition came back in 2009 as it purchased the rights to the work shortly after release of the novel. What’s taken so long to get it going you might ask? Apparently, when the show was announced in &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/showtime-teams-with-steven-spielberg-and-stephen-king-for-under-the-dome-series/#more-164928"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that they had still been searching for a writer to cross the bridge from print to script. Luckily, it seems that they have found a good man for the job. &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/11/brian-k-vaughan-to-adapt-stephen-kings-under-the-dome-as-series-for-showtime/"&gt;Deadline&lt;/a&gt; reports that the chosen writer will be none other than multiple Eisner Award winner &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_K._Vaughan"&gt;Brian K. Vaughn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-594"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Vaughn, who isn’t a stranger to working with and respecting established properties, is seemly perfect for the task coming from a background in comics. For those of you that might be a little on edge about a comic writer taking the reins, really don’t worry. Telling the tale of humanity gone to hell for the residents of Chester’s Mill in the face of the unexplained is right in Vaughn’s ballpark. In his own master work, &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt;, Vaughn dug deep to show the sways of human emotion, punchy dialogue, and the know how to keep a story compelling. Couple this experience with his time as a writer on J.J. Abrams’ &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, and you can begin to understand just how his interpretation of King’s material will evolve into a thriller worthy of the horror author’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that as things progress we’ll hear nothing but good things coming into play for this adaptation. I must admit that I have al feeling that it could swing the way of the prematurely cancelled &lt;em&gt;Jericho&lt;/em&gt; did or even as high as &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Most of that will ride on how the frame work will be carried over and stretched from the novel to fit a long running series. The potential is there, but accelerating the original progression to move onto written for TV filler will easily cripple the entire production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wait for filming to begin, how about someone gets to making Vaughn’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man"&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into a film or TV show?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>If you are a big &lt;a href="http://www.bruce-campbell.com/"&gt;Bruce Campbell&lt;/a&gt; fan like me, we all know that there was a little light of happiness that kicked on for us when &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/"&gt;Sam Raimi’s&lt;/a&gt; next film was announced. When it was released that Raimi is directing a visit back to the world of Oz in &lt;em&gt;Oz the Great and Powerful&lt;/em&gt;, the wheels in my brain started churning.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/sad-news-for-campbell-fans-role-in-next-raimi-film-axed/attachment/campbelloz/" rel="attachment wp-att-576"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-576 alignleft" title="campbelloz" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/campbelloz.jpg" alt="bruce campbell, sam raimi, movie, spider-man, cameo, oz the great and powerful, removed" width="220" height="330" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you are a big &lt;a href="http://www.bruce-campbell.com/"&gt;Bruce Campbell&lt;/a&gt; fan like me, we all know that there was a little light of happiness that kicked on for us when &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/"&gt;Sam Raimi’s&lt;/a&gt; next film was announced. When it was released that Raimi is directing a visit back to the world of Oz in &lt;em&gt;Oz the Great and Powerful&lt;/em&gt;, the wheels in my brain started churning. It is a well-documented fact that Raimi often includes Campbell in his productions in a cameo facility. Most recently you might remember him as Peter Parker’s real nemesis in each of the &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; films. Going from ring announcer, to snooty usher, followed by maître d’, Campbell had the tasks of being just enough of a jerk to give Parker problems in his real life through trivial actions. As was the case with each of these cameos, Campbell brought his trademark brand of humor as a bright spot for the films (and narration of the video games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it looks like our hopes were dashed rather quickly when Bruce took to Twitter to let his fans know that his role had been cut from the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/sad-news-for-campbell-fans-role-in-next-raimi-film-axed/attachment/bruce-not-in-oz/" rel="attachment wp-att-575"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-575" title="bruce-not-in-oz" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/bruce-not-in-oz.jpg" alt="bruce campbell, sam raimi, movie, spider-man, cameo, oz the great and powerful, removed" width="521" height="108" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can ponder on just what kind of sass he would have brought to the film, but it appears that it just wasn’t meant to be. In the mean time, we still get to watch him as the unflappable Sam Axe in USA’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/burnnotice/"&gt;Burn Notice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Who knows, we might even be treated to a brief appearance in &lt;em&gt;The Evil Dead&lt;/em&gt; remake.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>There are many IR Blaster technologies available for changing the channel from a different room, but only one or two for the iOS. The Peel is one of those iOS IR Blaster technologies.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-peel-universal-remote-control-ios/attachment/peel-banner-20/" rel="attachment wp-att-549"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Peel-Banner-20.jpg" alt="" title="Peel-Banner-20" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-549" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time cable came into your house. All you had to do was plug a coaxial cable into your television. Depending on the limits of your television&amp;#8217;s own tuner, you probably had channels 2-13 for cable. Times have obviously changed, and Bruce Springsteen&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;57 Channels and Nothing On&amp;#8221; is off by at least an order of magnitude. Modern times and cheap televisions have lead to situations where you may not need or be able to afford a cable box on every television. Due to this, the old method of a simple coaxial (or HDMI) cable to another room is having a bit of a renaissance. Some tuner boxes make this easy with radio frequency remotes, but most don&amp;#8217;t. There are many IR Blaster technologies available for changing the channel from a different room, but only one or two for the iOS. &lt;a href="http://www.peel.com" target="_blank"&gt;The Peel&lt;/a&gt; is one of those iOS IR Blaster technologies. This hardware and software combination reaches quite far with it&amp;#8217;s feature set. Is it too ambitious, or just right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-561"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Peel is a three-component system based on IR Blaster technology. The trio of parts are the Peel fruit which does the blasting, the cable which plugs into your network and broadcasts to the fruit, and the iOS app that controls the pair. Setup is pretty simple. Point the fruit at the devices you wish controlled and plug in the cable into your router. The documentation does address that this needs to be plugged into the router. Thinking outside the normal setup, in the interest of testing, I tried plugging it in elsewhere in my wired network. The Peel cable doesn&amp;#8217;t work properly if plugged in elsewhere. After the rudimentary device installation is complete, the iOS application will take you the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application configuration is by far the most complicated, but not that difficult by any stretch. Initially the devices you wish to control with your Peel are configured. Lost the unique remote codes? No problem. The Peel application will look them up for you by make and model, and even go through a basic functionality testing- on/off, volume control, et cetera. The Peel controls much more than a television and a tuner box. You can configure just about any other IR remote based device, like many receivers, even an AppleTV or Roku box. Following hardware configuration the app uses location services to pinpoint which television guide it should download for you based on your selection of cable provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_565" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-peel-universal-remote-control-ios/attachment/peel-app-1-top-picks/" rel="attachment wp-att-565"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Peel-App-1-Top-Picks-1024x667.jpg" alt="Peel, Application" title="Peel App 1 Top Picks" width="640" height="416" class="size-large wp-image-565" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Show selection on the Peel application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of the device is mostly met- one iDevice as a universal remote without any dongles attachéd to the phone itself. There are a few flaws that hold the device back just a bit. While I found the interface usable, my iDevice proficient inlaws found the non-standard interface conventions a bit obtuse for regular use. They limited themselves to favorite channel switching and didn&amp;#8217;t really use the guide functionality that often. The app is just for the iPhone and is designed as such. When enlarged for the iPad, the sensitivity of some of the manual controls seems lessened somewhat. When left at original size, everything seems fine. Not having an iPad specific version of the application seems like an opportunity lost. I did speak with Peel PR regarding an iPad version of the app, and they reported that  &amp;#8220;(the) iPad is definitely on the roadmap, but there are a few things ahead of it.&amp;#8221; With any luck, the larger real estate will be fully taken advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_566" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-peel-universal-remote-control-ios/attachment/peel-app-3-playback-gesture-pad/" rel="attachment wp-att-566"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Peel-App-3-Playback-Gesture-Pad-1024x674.jpg" alt="Peel, App, Gesture" title="Peel App 3 Playback Gesture Pad" width="640" height="421" class="size-large wp-image-566" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&amp;quot;Joystick&amp;quot; for manual control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I had with the Peel is the Peel Cable. Communications between the Peel Fruit and the Peel Cable use a custom wireless solution. Getting the 802.11 signal to the cable isn&amp;#8217;t a problem, but the distance from your router to the Peel Fruit might create one. I had no problem in a fairly standard split-level house from the basement to the kitchen, but communications between the cable and fruit were inconsistent a bit farther away in an extension to the house. This may have been distance or a brick wall, I&amp;#8217;m not sure. If the cable functioned properly plugged into a network switch closer to the Fruit, then range or RF shielding effects wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been a problem. As noted earlier though, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work at all plugged in anyplace else but the router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our review primarily focused on controlling a cable box in an adjacent room from the viewing space. We did test it as a universal remote with a surround sound system and a DVD player with no problems. If all you&amp;#8217;re looking for is simple cable box control, then there are easier alternatives available. Many cable providers have options for your smartphone, especially if you have bundled services and compatible routers. Cable provider&amp;#8217;s smartphone solutions limit your home networking options, forcing you to use their routers. The Peel does exactly as advertised- it simplifies your remote situation as well as makes television a more customized experience. With it you get a more interactive TV guide on the remote, rather than what the cable provider force feeds you with your cable box. There are positively problems that call out for this elegant and attractive solution. Overall, we liked the Peel, and see where in the future further software updates would benefit the advanced and casual user alike.  There are other universal remote control solution available, but the more flexible ones cost more than $99 (not including the cost of the iDevice, of course).  I&amp;#8217;m not sure technically why the Peel cable needs to be plugged into the router only and I&amp;#8217;d like to see this resolved in the future, but I do recommend the Peel for just about every universal remote control application from both a functionality and stylistic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>First of all, I'm going to come right out and say that my viewpoint may not be popular, even with my co-host.

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/the-vga-awards-and-you-or-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/attachment/vga2011_spike_blog_vgalogo/" rel="attachment wp-att-560"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/vga2011_spike_blog_vgalogo.jpg" alt="" title="vga2011_spike_blog_vgalogo" width="600" height="347" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-560" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#8217;m going to come right out and say that my viewpoint may not be popular, even with my co-host.  I spent a little while watching the VGAs last night (On Spike, which they seemed to keep having to remind us), and I&amp;#8217;m not sure of this particular show&amp;#8217;s relevancy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-559"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know broadcast television is all about money making, selling commercials, and turning a profit, and I don&amp;#8217;t begrudge them that.  What I begrudge is a teabag skit.  What I begrudge is the presentation.  I know I&amp;#8217;m not the VGA award&amp;#8217;s prime demographic, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure why I&amp;#8217;m not.  The average gamer age is closer to my age than to the apparent target of the VGA awards was.  Plus, while gaming has taken great strides in the public perception in the last 10 years, we&amp;#8217;re still fighting for wider gamer representation in the population as a whole, and even in the government.  How is a blatant misogynist and homophobic show on a major cable network (regardless of the primarily male oriented channel programming) going to enhance the view of the pubic at large of us as gamers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong- we need public awards.  We need a show.  We need a voting block, whether it be gamers or industry luminaries.  We don&amp;#8217;t need any -isms.  There are plenty of -isms on the internet, &lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/3/19/" target="_blank"&gt;pointed out by Gabriel&amp;#8217;s GIFT&lt;/a&gt;.  Breasts are trivial to see in other venues than a video game award show.  We don&amp;#8217;t need two hours of upcoming game trailers during the awards show.  Trailers are easy to find on the internet, on G4, before movies, or even on commercials during major network prime time programming.  This show, more than any other before it felt like an extension of the marketing arms of any one of a host of video game companies and a ill-humored sexist hour plus of television. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>On the eve of &lt;a href="http://www.syfy.com/"&gt;Syfy’s&lt;/a&gt; original winter showcase, I’m again reminded of how I loathe the decision makers of the cable channel. Not just because of some of the eye-gouging films and reality TV shows they feed to hungry science fiction loving nerds, but because of the continual mistreatment of their popular franchises. Instead of nurturing their shows and allowing them to rise or fall on their own, they hack them off seemingly out of nowhere. While they may give their show runners the leeway to do fun things like actually being able to produce Christmas themed episodes, they force the shows to take a bow before it is really their time to move on from the lime light. The most recent show to have the proverbial axe brought down upon it by the hands of poor judgment happened to be &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt;.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/eurekas-fifth-season-to-be-the-last-another-syfy-error/attachment/eureka-cancel/" rel="attachment wp-att-555"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Eureka-Cancel.jpg" alt="Eureka, cancel, Syfy, Comcast, error, budget, costs, Jack Carter" title="Eureka-Cancel" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-555" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the eve of &lt;a href="http://www.syfy.com/"&gt;Syfy’s&lt;/a&gt; original winter showcase, I’m again reminded of how I loathe the decision makers of the cable channel. Not just because of some of the eye-gouging films and reality TV shows they feed to hungry science fiction loving nerds, but because of the continual mistreatment of their popular franchises. Instead of nurturing their shows and allowing them to rise or fall on their own, they hack them off seemingly out of nowhere. While they may give their show runners the leeway to do fun things like actually being able to produce Christmas themed episodes, they force the shows to take a bow before it is really their time to move on from the lime light. The most recent show to have the proverbial axe brought down upon it by the hands of poor judgment happened to be &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-554"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you that might not know, &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; is town off the beaten path imagined around the hills of Grants Pass, Oregon. As a typical small town, they like to keep to themselves. It might not be the reason you think though. A bastion of discovery sparked by Einstein himself, &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; is a breakthrough scientific mecca that manages to create the impossible on a daily basis thanks to the best and brightest of the world. While transporting his handful of a daughter back to her mother’s home, the bumbling hero Agent Jack Carter stumbles unwittingly into this small town. Helping stop a catastrophe from wiping out the town, Carter finds a place in the town as sheriff. He’s surrounded by those of vast intelligence, only rivaling their level of knowledge with his own street smarts. The show has evolved over time to keep the plots running and the twists going outside of the emergency of the week episodes that are at its core. In 2012, the fifth and final season will wrap on the cable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole handling of the eventual cancellation of &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; was a botched job from the top down. Just touching the surface of how badly this was handled, the show runners were completely in the dark about the show being in trouble. With the flip-flopping of the cancellation, then the ordering of six more episodes, followed by the cancellation again (but this time with one episode to wrap it all up), it appeared as a bumbling mess. Fans, cast members and creators alike were being thrown from emotional side to side as Syfy ultimately decided the fate of our favorite advancement pioneers. In a statement once the final decision was cast, Syfy had this to say about the closure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“After painstaking consideration, we have had to make the difficult business decision to not order a season six of Eureka. But Eureka is not over yet. There is a new holiday episode this December and 12 stellar episodes set to debut next year, marking its fifth season and six memorable years on Syfy. The 2012 episodes are some of the best we&amp;#8217;ve seen, and will bring this great series to a satisfying end. We are very grateful to Bruce Miller and Jaime Paglia, their team of incredible writers, and an amazing cast and crew who have consistently delivered a series we continue to be very proud of. We thank the fans for their support of this show and know they will enjoy its final season in 2012.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might wonder what exactly brought on the demise of the once most successful show on the channel. Rumor is that due to the rising costs of the show, the possibility of a sixth season actually was slapped from their hands due in part to the Comcast-Universal merger. In an interview with executive producer Bruce Berg done by &lt;a href="http://screenrant.com/eureka-canceled-series-finale-ending-aco-127496/"&gt;Screen Rant&lt;/a&gt;, he states, “we could not maintain the quality of our show with the cuts it would take to make us profitable for Syfy’s new parent company.” He goes on to say that it wasn’t as if the executives at Syfy just rolled over at the decision. If that’s the case, is there more this or other show endings that Syfy (or Sci-Fi) have put us through? We may never know the real reasoning behind some of them, but from the sources I have to think that there is some truth to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that the cost to produce each episode had been going up at a larger scale than most shows do over time. Looking at how much the effects seem to have improved and the list of higher profile actors being brought in after the third season, one can clearly understand how the budget would escalate. Part of me has to wonder what else could have been going on in the background with the show’s budget. Ratings for the show have been quite good considering the decay over time for most original cable shows. Ranging from 4.1 million during the series premiere to 2.5 million for the fourth season starter, the decay hung around a 2.2 household rating for the series. I know it isn’t the ratings killer that wrestling might be or as cheap as any number of reality shows to produce, but that isn’t bad. This just shows how eventually all networks are going to succumb to the bottom dollar rather than put something out that has lasting power. Of course this is the case with our country&amp;#8217;s entertainment industry. The difference is when you look at the number of shows that come and go on a regular basis; you know that just sticking with a show would be more appealing to advertisers over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, if you enjoy the show, I behest you to watch it while you can. As shows go, &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; has managed to keep things fun, entertaining and interesting through the course of the show. Thanks to Syfy’s big brother Comcast we won’t be seeing a season past five in the immediate future. By no means does that give us the luxury to give up on it. Continue to support it until the end, folks. I have no doubt that the show won’t come to a satisfying close. When you see the fun that was had in the Christmas special, it lets you know just how much the show was loved by the entire body of people that stepped on the sets. You never know, it might continue on life in another media as other past Syfy shows have.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Enter the extreme sci-fi base jumping / faux-protest game AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA: For The Awesome (henceforth known as AAA:FTA) by Dejobaan Studios and Owlchemy Labs. If I needed a shot of adrenaline into my life, I've got it now. The question is, do I want another hit?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-for-the-awesome/attachment/aaa-20/" rel="attachment wp-att-548"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/AAA-20.jpg" alt="AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA, For The Awesome , SSX, Dejobaan, Owlchemy, base jumping, adrenaline, protesters, hugs, kisses," title="AAA-20" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-548" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I haven&amp;#8217;t been an enormous risk taker during my life. About the scariest thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever done was swam across a narrow channel to get to an old castle while I was overseas nearly two decades ago. Enter the extreme sci-fi base jumping / faux-protest game &lt;em&gt;AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA: For The Awesome&lt;/em&gt; (henceforth known as &lt;em&gt;AAA:FTA&lt;/em&gt;) by &lt;a href="http://dejobaan.com/"&gt;Dejobaan Studios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://owlchemylabs.com/"&gt;Owlchemy Labs&lt;/a&gt;. If I needed a shot of adrenaline into my life, I&amp;#8217;ve got it now. The question is, do I want another hit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-544"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_545" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-for-the-awesome/attachment/aaafromorbit/" rel="attachment wp-att-545"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/AAAfromorbit-1024x640.png" alt="For the Awesome, Orbit" title="AAAfromorbit" width="640" height="400" class="size-large wp-image-545" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the more perilous places to jump&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does one do in &lt;em&gt;AAA:FTA&lt;/em&gt;? You launch yourself off of buildings with the intent of not dying on the way down. If avoiding turbines, buildings, and other structures wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, you collect kisses and hugs by tagging a building or staying close to a building for extended periods of time respectively. Protesters line the course, giving you the pleasure of communicating with them in a vulgar manner if so you choose. Government buildings need spray paint defacement on the way down since they&amp;#8217;ve outlawed your extreme sport of choice. See a bird? Angle into it for impact to be awarded big points! At the end of the course, you pop your chute and aim for a landing target. You can miss the target but unless you miss the ground completely, you&amp;#8217;re not dead. Incentive to play levels you&amp;#8217;ve already completed comes in the form of kneecaps. Score well on an already completed level and be rewarded with this currency which allows you to unlock more of the 125 levels included with the game. Progress through the levels isn&amp;#8217;t linear. You just have to select one that&amp;#8217;s adjacent in the map to one you&amp;#8217;ve already unlocked, so there&amp;#8217;s not one true path through the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_546" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-for-the-awesome/attachment/aaalevelselection/" rel="attachment wp-att-546"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/AAAlevelselection-1024x640.png" alt="For the awesome, level selection" title="AAAlevelselection" width="640" height="400" class="size-large wp-image-546" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Level selection.  Pithy wisdom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word to the wise- this game is pitiless and without remorse. Whether by accident or design, it assumes you have some familiarity with the gameplay concepts from the first &lt;em&gt;AAA&lt;/em&gt; and you&amp;#8217;re just thrown into the game with little tutorial or fanfare. There is an escalation of difficulty as you progress, but there&amp;#8217;s just no beginning handholding at all. I will confess, I did end up splattered on the top of many a building until I got a better feel for the controls. That&amp;#8217;s not the fault of the game. I had no difficulty with controls, it was just my own brain not pre-plotting my path correctly and executing accurately. This game is a the stereotypical example of practice making perfect, and in many ways it reminds me of a bizarre variant of the &lt;em&gt;SSX&lt;/em&gt; series in both presentation and attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_547" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-for-the-awesome/attachment/aaaprotesters/" rel="attachment wp-att-547"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/AAAprotesters-1024x640.png" alt="For the awesome, protesters" title="AAAprotesters" width="640" height="400" class="size-large wp-image-547" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;See those guys on the right? Give them &amp;quot;the salute&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically, the game is intense. Almost every action game has some sort of falling mechanic, whether it just be a Mario jump arc or gravity&amp;#8217;s effect on a skateboarder. In no other game have I felt the momentum. My wife is prone to video game motion sickness, and we&amp;#8217;ve taken steps throughout the years to minimize her exposure to first person shooters and the like. While I was playing this game on a 15&amp;#8243; laptop screen, she couldn&amp;#8217;t even so much as glance at the screen while I was playing without inducing a bit of nausea. Mission accomplished! Sound presentation is fine, nothing to complain about. There&amp;#8217;s enough aural feedback to let you know when you&amp;#8217;ve accomplished a task. That&amp;#8217;s a good thing, since taking your eyes off of your flight path pretty much means instant death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a complaint with the game, but really only one. I think this game would benefit significantly from the motion sensitivity of a tablet rather than keyboard and mouse commands. Dejobaan released this game in conjunction with Owlchemy, who&amp;#8217;s most famous contribution to gaming is the well-publicized iOS release &lt;em&gt;Smuggle/Snuggle Truck&lt;/em&gt;. Make it so! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AAA:FTA&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; predecessor was nominated for all kinds of awards, and featured at PAX East&amp;#8217;s indie showcase a while back. This incarnation is newer, flashier, and contains the original game in it&amp;#8217;s entirety as well as 45 new levels. There is a demo available on Steam if you&amp;#8217;re on the fence. Unlike most recent demos, it gives you a perfect feel for the game. Word to the wise- if you&amp;#8217;re prone to gaming motion sickness, do not play this game under any circumstances. At $10 regular price, if extreme sci-fi sports are your thing, go get it now. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a sale other than a launch sale, but still- two large Starbucks coffees is a small price to pay if this is the kind of game you enjoy.  If you&amp;#8217;re a fan of the original, or have ever put &lt;em&gt;SSX&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;SSX:Tricky&lt;/em&gt; into your console and enjoyed it, then you&amp;#8217;ll also like &lt;em&gt;AAA:FTA&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game provided by developer for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anubis joins us in one of our sillier podcasts in recent memory. The dynamics of three podcasting recorders are unique, and perhaps we need to get uniforms going to celebrate this. We better be careful about that though. Slap a name tag on our group and wandering in packs in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; and we might arouse suspicion. In any event, topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anti-Piracy group Brein is being sued for piracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EA pulls another fast one with a Tetris community annual pass on the iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A US judge orders sites de-indexed from &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, etc. What?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congress versus Blackwater/Xi. Fight!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we really need a &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;MMORPG?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legend&lt;/em&gt;, a D20 based RPG is available, pay what you want to benefit &lt;a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/"&gt;Child&amp;#8217;s Play&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous is threatening banks with Robin Hood-style attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How and why should the Geneva convention apply to video games?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen carefully, you might hear the beginning of the 20 Sides of Nerd Christmas giveaways! Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Let’s all be honest with ourselves, the &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/em&gt; franchise has never been anymore more than the gaming equivalent to a summer popcorn flick. A film that’s sole purpose is to bring in the patrons for action, gratuitous violence, massive explosions, cheesy dialogue, questionable story, and most importantly overwhelming odds. For those reasons, my brain connects &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://sylvesterstallone.com/"&gt;Sylvester Stallone&lt;/a&gt; et al mega action hero flick, &lt;a href="http://expendablesthemovie.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like a kooky idea right? It might not be as out there as you think. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/serious-sam-3-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-530"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-530" title="Serious-Sam-3-Banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Serious-Sam-3-Banner.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps " width="660" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually whenever I’m writing, I tend to have something going on in the background to ease me along. Be it a movie, TV show or some music, it helps me keep the magpie part of my brain occupied. When I sat down to write about &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3: BFE&lt;/em&gt;, I managed to pick a film that embodies perhaps what the goal has been for &lt;a href="http://www.croteam.com/"&gt;Croteam&lt;/a&gt; all along. Let’s all be honest with ourselves, the &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/em&gt; franchise has never been anymore more than the gaming equivalent to a summer popcorn flick. A film that’s sole purpose is to bring in the patrons for action, gratuitous violence, massive explosions, cheesy dialogue, questionable story, and most importantly overwhelming odds. For those reasons, my brain connects &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://sylvesterstallone.com/"&gt;Sylvester Stallone&lt;/a&gt; et al mega action hero flick, &lt;a href="http://expendablesthemovie.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds like a kooky idea right? It might not be as out there as you think. Each of these vie for our entertainment dollar, often rivaling each other in price, so why shouldn’t we draw comparisons between the two?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-529"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_535" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-calm-before/" rel="attachment wp-att-535"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-535" title="SS3 Calm Before" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Calm-Before.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The scenery might look great, but you won&amp;#39;t have many moments outside of this to take a good look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For awhile now Hollywood has been developing vehicles, aka films, for specific stars. Be it ones they want to pander to, fast track or build upon, actors have been specifically primed in some cases. Otherwise why would we be seeing the trend of film franchises going way past the acclaimed trilogy idea, or basically continuing on or telling the same story as some older film with the same actor? This is very apparent when you contrast films and video games. From &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005458/"&gt;Jason Statham&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvester Stallone, and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472/"&gt;Jet Li&lt;/a&gt; in films to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen"&gt;Commander Keen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Ezio_Auditore_da_Firenze"&gt;Ezio Auditore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man"&gt;Mega Man&lt;/a&gt; in video games. As pop culture goes on, we’re fed the same stuff like whether we like it or not. The only difference is as movie star ages they tend to get a reprieve in what they are asked to do. Video game stars just go on and on. Sam “Serious” Stone is a prime example here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t familiar with the &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/em&gt; franchise, this is as good a place to jump in as any. An evil alien overload named Mental wants to destroy Earth with his twisted alien creatures. In order to stop him, humanity decided to send a man through a time lock device left behind by another race of aliens that battled Mental and his minions long ago. There was only one man thought tough enough to be able to get the job done- Sam Stone. Jumping into the skin of Sam, it is your job to shoot your way through anything that gets in your way. You want plot? Forget it. What I described above is about all you get. &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; plot is just like the paper thin plot of &lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt; involving over the hill mercenaries for hire who destroy whatever they are paid to do so, seemingly for the hell of it. Really, what was the point of it besides getting these idle action heroes a pay check? And like the summer film, you can invite your friends along to for the devastation in &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_534" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-534" title="SS3 Birthday" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Birthday.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gratuitous blood too much for you? Think it is just too much for your kids? Don&amp;#39;t worry, the game allows for other options like slime blood, hippie flowers and confetti!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of it all the only promise you can expect from a &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/em&gt; title is the promise of mayhem. Serious Sam 3 delivers it in spades. Taking cue from the earlier titles, it jumps right back into the madness that Croteam strove to accomplish in the first place. Styled like early first person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Duke Nukem 3D&lt;/em&gt;, it has the feel that many people that have been fighting the PC fight will be right at home with. Circle strafers rejoice! Monsters will be thrown at you constantly until you master the ability to mow evil down with your weapon of choice. The game won’t make this an easy task either. I mean sure, click, point, boom…not that hard. What makes it more difficult is the fact that the game will continuously throw things at you for the sake of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-slaughter-example/" rel="attachment wp-att-539"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-539" title="SS3 Slaughter Example" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Slaughter-Example.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;And this is a light case of the bodies that will stand in your way&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it seems like I am down on the action, let me assure you this isn’t the case. Action is predominately what both &lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt; set out to have. There were never going to be any awards given out for the stellar script in either case. The campaign will keep you busy for some time, especially if you are a completionist. The real gold can be found in the multiplayer. Unlike many shooters out there, &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam&lt;/em&gt; has kept its co-op feature. Not many FPS games out there in the PC world hold onto this feature, let alone allow you to do it with 15 others online or split screen on one computer. That isn’t the best part. Once you start your first deathmatch game, your adrenaline will start bubbling in your veins while drool drips from your lips. This is the style of play from the days of yore. The rush hits as you gib your enemies as they rush for the coveted rocket launcher. Double barrel shotguns will once again rule the day. By far, this is the best the game has to offer- pure, unhinged annihilation. Not only that, but it offers six different modes of head to head play. The only catch is a limited selection of both maps to play on and players to actually go up against. During my play time I was actually only able to find under populated deathmatch servers to play on. Those were enough. I missed the fast paced play of games like this. No cover mechanics, no gimmick abilities or regenerative shields to screw around with, no bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_538" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-shotgun-dm/" rel="attachment wp-att-538"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-538" title="SS3 Shotgun DM" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Shotgun-DM.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Climbing those crates won&amp;#39;t do you much good, bub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Serious 3.5 engine is no joke. Once again advanced with the rest of the game during development, the developers have really outdone themselves. The engine looks great on any setting. It seems that just about anything can be destroyed. Not only by the players, but mobs play a hand at leveling things to wreckage. Even the monsters you fight have been given a wonderful makeover by the art division. Why don’t more developers approach Croteam to license their engine? It has plenty to offer. The only thing I’d like to see is a little more detail put into the player models. For some reason they look out of place with the grotesque beauty of everything around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_536" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-engine-destruction/" rel="attachment wp-att-536"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-536" title="SS3 Engine Destruction" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Engine-Destruction.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Buildings crumble, walls are tore down, and spaceships explode. Just a small sample of what the Serious 3.5 engine is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the good, I have to jump back a little to the point of doing reviews in the first place. We all know that shooters don’t have the greatest track record when it comes to inspiring us to play. I mean, &lt;em&gt;Doom 2’s&lt;/em&gt; story was that demons from hell killed your rabbit. I can relate to that story as a bunny owner myself, but if we’re using that to set the bar- it’s pretty damn low. Literally it seems like the action connects the dots for &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt;, just like its film companion I watched as I wrote this. There are clip scenes where Sam is talking back to command, but they are extremely disconnected. You get a brief idea of what is going on, but only enough to set everything up. You are supposed to know what was going on from the other games that came before, but remember that this release is actually supposed to be a prequel. This is just what &lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt; did as well though. You take a page from the successful things of the past and wrap a shoddy story around them. Take a little dash of martial arts from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103285/"&gt;Once Upon A Time in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a little jungle action a la &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089880/"&gt;Rambo 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, let &lt;a href="http://www.randycouture.tv/"&gt;Randy Couture&lt;/a&gt; do MMA against &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0042524/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Stone Cold&amp;#8221; Steve Austin&lt;/a&gt; and you have a good base going. Toss in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000616/"&gt;Eric Roberts&lt;/a&gt; (or someone just like him) to play generic evil villain stereotype-A and give everyone else in the movie a gun and boom, you&amp;#8217;re practically 80% there. Everything is done for thrill value instead of plot and character advancement. It is just something to keep your eyes busy. To be fair, it isn’t like any of us were expecting Shakespearean dialog from either of these titles though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_533" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-alien-civ/" rel="attachment wp-att-533"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-533" title="SS3 Alien Civ" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Alien-Civ.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The depth of the puzzles is running around collecting keys. Through it, you get to see some of the best level design the game has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to characters and acting, it doesn’t really get any better. The voice of Sam, John J. Dick, is fingernails on the chalkboard. He lacks the even mock enthusiasm that Sam should be saturated in to the point of it dripping on the floor. I don’t know if it is for lack of trying on his part, the poor dialogue writing, or if he was just getting tired of doing satire of Duke, but the parody excuse can only be taken so far. Writing has to play some element here. Once we compare it to our handy action movie again, it’s clear that they really didn’t have to strive for much. Even when breaking the fourth wall, Sam has a hard time cracking a laugh out of the player. His one-liners are hideous. Then again, if you look into the depth of dialogue that &lt;em&gt;The Expendables&lt;/em&gt; has to offer, you can see how many won’t regard this as much of a problem. Think of the poem that Jason Statham’s character Christmas recites at the end of the film. It is absolutely wretched. When you look at the sum of the actors, they all do what they are good at. All of which seems to be trying to look good hitting people. True to form, Sam Stone seems no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_537" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-serious-sam-3bfe-pc/attachment/ss3-read/" rel="attachment wp-att-537"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-537" title="SS3 Read" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/SS3-Read.jpg" alt="Serious Sam, Serious Sam 3, BFE, Croteam, Action, prequel, The Expendables, Sylvester Stallone, Sam Stone, Mental, monsters, shooter, fps" width="630" height="394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It should do you wise to actually read the information given to you by your &amp;quot;heads up&amp;quot; computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At $40, I question if this title is worth it. If you are a fan of what has been done with the &lt;em&gt;Serious&lt;/em&gt; series so far, then by all means it will be a good bet. With the outstanding graphics engine, retro homage to FPS days gone by, and addicting multiplayer all wrapped in a modern shell, you’ll be in love. However, you’ll have to deal with the frustrations of endless cannon fodder situations that can and will overwhelm you at times regardless of skill or arsenal. On top of that, the fast paced murderfest known as deathmatch won’t shine that bright when you have problems even finding others to play with. Let’s not even speak about getting co-op together. Can you convince 15 other people to buy it with you? Hell, do you even know that many people who&amp;#8217;d want to play? Twenty bucks seems like a sweet spot for this title. Hopefully it won’t take long for it to get there. In the mean time, it will be a nice intermediary title that you can waste a weekend on and still get some good value on afterwards. If massive, repetitive slaughtering is your name, then &lt;em&gt;Serious Sam 3&lt;/em&gt; is your game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS – Croteam, more rocket splash damage please. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Game provided by developer for review &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Averaging 2.55 million viewers (a 1.9 household rating), the show has done nothing but rise in viewership over the first season.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/haven-continues-its-tales-of-the-troubles-picked-up-for-season-3/attachment/haven-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-426"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-426 aligncenter" title="haven-banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/haven-banner.jpg" alt="Haven, Syfy, Stephen King, troubles, season three, renewal, Emily Rose, Lucas Bryant, Ed Balfour " width="660" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of &lt;a href="http://www.syfy.com"&gt;Syfy’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Haven&lt;/em&gt; will be happy to know that the cable network has decided to pick up the show for a third season in 2012. Averaging 2.55 million viewers (a 1.9 household rating), the show has done nothing but rise in viewership over the first season. Based on the short story &lt;em&gt;The Colorado Kid&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.stephenking.com/index.html"&gt;Stephen King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Haven&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the strange events of the small town Haven, Maine. I know a Stephen King story based in Maine is such a foreign concept, right? The show tells the story of FBI agent, turned local cop Audrey Parker coming to Haven to track down a fugitive. She ended up getting more than she bargained for when she started digging around in Haven, raising questions about her own past. Parker has an ability that allows her to help the residents afflicted by the supernatural “troubles” that plague the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Stern, President of Original Programming had nothing but kind things to say about the renewal. &amp;#8220;The superb cast, led by Emily Rose, Eric Balfour and Lucas Bryant, along with the terrific production team, delivered a successful season in both critical acclaim and rising viewership. We&amp;#8217;re very excited to see this compelling series return for a third season of supernatural intrigue in 201,&amp;#8221; said Stern in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Eureka’s&lt;/em&gt; unfortunate departure from the network, it is clear that SyFy is going to have to fill in the gaps. Still reeling from the conclusion of &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;, the subsequent cancellation of &lt;em&gt;Caprica&lt;/em&gt;, and the unknown nature of &lt;em&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Chrome&lt;/em&gt;, there seems to be a lack of drama tinged series on the network. Not to mention the disappointing sinking of the &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt; franchise with &lt;em&gt;Stargate Universe&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Alphas&lt;/em&gt; may have earned a second season pick up, though I question why. I suppose any original series is better than more wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, Syfy has little to pull out of the development tank. New shows may have been announced, but with the development slate the way it is with the channel, who knows if we will ever see any of them. One thing is clear though. Syfy needs to keep their audiences where they have them, so picking up &lt;em&gt;Haven&lt;/em&gt; was really a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Syfy’s official announcement &lt;a href="http://blastr.com/2011/10/syfys-haven-renewed-for-1.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>In a bit of news that truly saddens me to the core, it was announced that the on-going &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt; comic series put out through &lt;a href="http://www.boom-studios.com/"&gt;BOOM! Studios&lt;/a&gt; came to an end with issue 24. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/farscape-ends-again-ongoing-comic-series-reaches-its-finale/attachment/farscape-end-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-514"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-514 aligncenter" title="farscape-end-banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/farscape-end-banner.jpg" alt="Farscape, BOOM! Studios, Rockne S. O'Bannon, Keith R.A. de Candido, comics, end, ongoing, series, canon, sci-fi" width="682" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bit of news that truly saddens me to the core, it was announced that the on-going &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt; comic series put out through &lt;a href="http://www.boom-studios.com/"&gt;BOOM! Studios&lt;/a&gt; came to an end with issue 24. Now this shouldn’t come as a shock to those who are fans of the series. We’ve been dealt this heartache not once, but twice during the life of the television show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-512"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now before anyone goes on to start another &lt;a href="http://www.watchfarscape.com"&gt;Save Farscape&lt;/a&gt; campaign, let me remind you that we’re lucky to have another look into the universe after the television series conclusion with &lt;em&gt;The Peacekeeper Wars&lt;/em&gt;. While it wasn’t nearly what the originally promised season five would have been, it was a conclusion nonetheless. When it was announced that &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt; would live on in comics, &amp;#8216;Scapers as a whole were beyond thrilled. When we learned that it was going to be tied to canon as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockne_S._O%27Bannon"&gt;Rockne S. O’Bannon&lt;/a&gt; would be involved, along with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_R._A._DeCandido"&gt;Keith R.A. de Candido&lt;/a&gt; (author of the tie-in novel, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Farscape-House-Keith-R-DeCandido/dp/0812561627/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1321742470&amp;amp;sr=1-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there was no doubt that the series would pick up right where we left off. What we probably never expected was that it would lead to a three year run, along with seven other mini-series books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be too disappointed in the wrap up of the series though. It had a fantastic run, even if it did leave us with some unanswered questions. However, that doesn’t mean it will be the end. Remember that BOOM! Studios were the second company to run a &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt; comic (after WildStorm). As with all sci-fi shows, death is never really the end in comics. It’s possible that down the line we might see another run of mini-series from BOOM! or even another publisher (webcomic anyone?). Be thankful, given the state of the comic industry, that we were blessed with even a little more &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt;. For now, let us look up towards the future. Maybe now &lt;a href="http://henson.com/"&gt;The Jim Henson Company&lt;/a&gt; can get on those webisodes they’ve been promising for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note- If you’ve been waiting to buy the full series once it hit &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Farscape-Complete-Blu-ray-Ben-Browder/dp/B005CXOG8M/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1321740908&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt;, you are in luck.

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/world-of-warcraft-embraces-chuck-norris-meme-in-new-commercial/attachment/wow-norris-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-521"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-521 aligncenter" title="WoW-Norris-Banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/WoW-Norris-Banner.jpg" alt="Blizzard, meme, WoW, World of Warcraft, hunter, Chuck Norris, shark" width="660" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when you think that the Internet has finally had enough of as meme, &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; had to go and breathe new life into one. The newest in the &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s Your Game?&amp;#8221; celebrity commercial features none other than your favorite champion of the Internet- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris"&gt;Chuck Norris&lt;/a&gt;. Taking on the guise of a hunter brings new meaning to abilities like &lt;a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=2973/raptor-strike"&gt;Raptor Strike&lt;/a&gt; with Norris behind the keyboard. Since Chuck Norris jokes have been made for years in the various chat channels (you remember Barrens chat?), it was a smart PR move to pull support from the man himself. Some might say this is a further move towards jumping the shark after &lt;em&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;#8220;selling out&amp;#8221; by Norris. However, I think that it was only a matter of time before these two finally got together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor and hide if you see a human jump kicking various people around town. I&amp;#8217;d really run if you play a gnome or a goblin. Yeesh, he doesn&amp;#8217;t take too kindly to the smaller folk of Azeroth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week isn&amp;#8217;t all about government shenanigans, but a great deal of it is. In all seriousness if you are a fan of doing anything on the Internet, this is something of great concern. We like it when we get fired up about a topic, and you should too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://music.google.com"&gt;Google Music&lt;/a&gt; launched, and Draeno doesn&amp;#8217;t like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/its-official-america-a-land-of-young-casual-pirates.ars" target="_blank"&gt;America is a land of young, casual pirates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; An entire Japanese and Korean MMORPG is just gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gamestop.com"&gt;Gamestop&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; 3rd quarter numbers are down, but still okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/"&gt;Robot Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; is done with DLC for PC &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has a patent for workplace behavior tracking. Where should they use it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is 1.0 now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; SOPA, and how it will destroy the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some helpful SOPA reading links: &lt;a href="http://cdt.org/paper/sopa-summary" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Democracy and Technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show" target="_blank"&gt;Open Congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.complex.com/video-games/2011/11/sony-nintendo-and-ea-backing-internet-censorship" target="_blank"&gt;EA and Nintendo&amp;#8217;s SOPA support&lt;/a&gt;.  Furthermore, you should look up the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_S.978" target="_blank"&gt;Commerical Felony Streaming Act&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your representative&amp;#8217;s contact information &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side, the closing theme for this week&amp;#8217;s podcast &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOBZTy1sqc&amp;#038;feature=player_embedded#!" target="_blank"&gt;must be seen to be fully appreciated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Following reports of unheard of viewership for a cable show, the network was quick to give the series more life on the small screen.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/the-walking-deads-hunger-grows-season-3-renewal/attachment/walking-dead-s3-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-507"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-507 aligncenter" title="Walking-Dead-S3-Banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Walking-Dead-S3-Banner.jpg" alt="The Walking Dead, TV, AMC, Robert Kirkman, comic, zombies, season three" width="682" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has been watching the show, &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; has been given a third season pickup by &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;. Following reports of unheard of viewership for a cable show, the network was quick to give the series more life on the small screen. The stir around this groundbreaking show has pulled tremendous weight with the previous audiences, whom only ten years ago may have ignored the channel altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-506"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Today we are pleased to announce that the &amp;#8216;dead&amp;#8217; shall live as we proudly renew &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; for a third season on AMC and, globally, with our terrific partners at Fox International Channels,&amp;#8221; said Charlie Collier, AMC&amp;#8217;s President. &amp;#8220;We are thankful for everyone&amp;#8217;s contribution in front of and behind the camera as we continue to make &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; a unique television experience[...]&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With TV degrading into the festering gene pool of reality television and re-hashed scripted dramas that it is, is it any wonder that a show like &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; has tremendous force behind it? More so, is it not amazing that this is an idea that has evolved from the comic industry into something that isn’t immediately panned into oblivion? With the ending of &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; this year, and the show lending its lead out slot to new shows like &lt;em&gt;Hell on Wheels&lt;/em&gt;, you can bet that AMC will ride &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; until it has nothing left to give. The undead may be slow to rise, but they sure do keep going. With the comic coming up on issue 100 in 2012, there will be plenty of meat to keep it that way. Now &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kirkman"&gt;Kirkman&lt;/a&gt; just needs to keep them more on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/the-walking-dead/2011/10/amc-renews-the-walking-dead.php"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>NBC's midseason lineup was released this last Monday, and the internet rage was swift and fierce. Community  didn't have a place on it. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=504"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-504 aligncenter" title="community-banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/community-banner.jpg" alt="Community, NBC, Troy, Abed, Inspector Spacetime, cancelled, spring schedule" width="682" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC&amp;#8217;s midseason lineup was released this last Monday, and the internet rage was swift and fierce. &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t have a place on it. No Troy and Abed, no Inspector Spacetime, no Señor Chang, probably not at least until the Fall of 2012 and then I expect it&amp;#8217;ll just be to air the rest of the already filmed episodes. A twitter show-saving campaign started (look for the hashtag #savecommunity), but I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s going to matter much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-498"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A quick look at the numbers for &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s airing plainly shows the problem. Viewership is terrible and getting worse even including Tivo and on demand numbers. At press time, the last episode of &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; was watched by 3.5 million viewers. This may not seem like much, but consider that &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; routinely draws &lt;a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/15/tv-ratings-broadcast-top-25-sunday-night-football-big-bang-theory-top-week-8-among-adults-18-49/110673/"&gt;16 million&lt;/a&gt; viewers in the same time slot. Season to season, average numbers and rankings are &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/full-2010-11-season-series-rankers/"&gt;dropping as well&lt;/a&gt;. The first season of &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; averaged 5 million viewers, &lt;a href="http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/full-series-rankings-for-the-2009-10-broadcast-season/"&gt;the second 4.5 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/chart-american-idol-nfl-duke-priciest-tv-spot/230547/#thurs"&gt;Advertising dollars&lt;/a&gt; per 30 second spot are down as well year to year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first examples of a critically admired show that&amp;#8217;s peripherally in our genre of television. It&amp;#8217;s also no shock looking at the numbers that it&amp;#8217;s about to be cancelled. Television is about money making. If a show isn&amp;#8217;t making money, it&amp;#8217;s not going to be continued. A prime example is &lt;em&gt;Jericho&lt;/em&gt;. While a brief reprieve was given to the post-apocalyptic drama after corporate headquarters were inundated with peanuts, I don&amp;#8217;t think the same or a similar trick will work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to save &lt;em&gt;Community&lt;/em&gt;? Watch it now, and when it returns. Watch it legally when it airs, on Tivo, or on &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be counted by the suits at the television studios. Consider that networks suits rarely care about fandom or critical acclaim, it&amp;#8217;s all about the bottom line- total viewership and the advertising dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Our very first topic on the podcast was the rumor that there was a HD remake of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; in progress at 343 Industries.  We've missed the target a few times, but not this time… This last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Halo Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;, the HD remake of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; hit the store shelves. Do gameplay tropes that the title introduced a decade ago count against it now, as it's been done a million time since, or is there a pass since the original title was the proto trope?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-halo-anniversary/attachment/halo-cea-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-511"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/halo-cea-banner.jpg" alt="Halo Anniversary, 343 industries, xbox, microsoft, Beaver Creek, Hang &amp;#039;Em High, Damnation, Prisoner, Headlong" title="halo-cea-banner" width="682" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-511" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve come full circle. Our very first topic on the podcast was the rumor that there was a HD remake of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; in progress at &lt;a href="http://halo.xbox.com/en-us/?"&gt;343 Industries&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve missed the target a few times, but not this time&amp;#8230; This last Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Halo Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;, the HD remake of &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; hit the store shelves. The review process has been both fascinating to read and participate in. Do you review the game like it&amp;#8217;s a new experience, or does it get some credit for being ten years old? Do gameplay tropes that the title introduced a decade ago count against it now, as it&amp;#8217;s been done a million times since, or is there a pass since the original title was the proto trope?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-490"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_491" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-halo-anniversary/attachment/anniversary/" rel="attachment wp-att-491"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Anniversary-1024x576.jpg" alt="Keyes, Halo Anniversary, Master Chief, Pillar of Autumn" title="Anniversary" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-491" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Captain Keyes and the Chief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that in the parlance of reviews I&amp;#8217;m supposed to discuss the setting and scenario in detail during the second or third paragraph after the introduction. I&amp;#8217;m not going to waste a lot of words here. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Chief_%28Halo%29"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt; is the ultimate bad ass space marine. It&amp;#8217;s been a long war, humanity is getting pounded, and Master Chief&amp;#8217;s escape from Reach with the artificial intelligence &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana"&gt;Cortana&lt;/a&gt; was a very near thing. Things go pear shaped, his escape ship is forced down on the ringworld and he&amp;#8217;s got to shoot his way out. Sounds like just about every other space marine game published in the last 10 years doesn&amp;#8217;t it? Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s a reason for that. Like it or not, &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; cast a very long shadow on the gaming industry. While it wasn&amp;#8217;t the first to implement vehicles in a shooter, &lt;a href="http://www.bungie.net/"&gt;Bungie&lt;/a&gt; executed them very well. A regenerating shield mechanic had been used before, but less as a player aid and more as a plot point hindering player progress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_492" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-halo-anniversary/attachment/anniversary2/" rel="attachment wp-att-492"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Anniversary2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Master Chief, dead grunt, halo anniversary" title="Anniversary2" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-492" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Master Chief is making his rounds through the corridors blasting all in his path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt; for the next decade. Gameplay remains unchanged. All the little quirks, tricks, and exploits you used in the original Xbox game still exist. Need to get the Warthog past the narrow channel in &lt;em&gt;The Silent Cartographer&lt;/em&gt;? Fine, no problem. That game behavior that prevents an Elite from hopping in a banshee on the final bridge in &lt;em&gt;The Assault on the Control Room&lt;/em&gt;? Still works. It&amp;#8217;s all still there. The selling point on &lt;em&gt;Halo Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; is the graphical layer on top of the 10 year old engine applying a HD and widescreen sheen to the gameplay. It shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as a surprise that it&amp;#8217;s very well done. Covenant surfaces are shiny and, well, purple. Human equipment is suitably gritty in a sci-fi war machine kind of way. I think that the Forerunner structures don&amp;#8217;t feel quite as grand after the graphical makeover, but that may be my imagination and detail filling from many hours in the campaign of the first game playing tricks on my mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing bad can be said about the original score by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_O%27Donnell"&gt;Marty O&amp;#8217;Donnell&lt;/a&gt;. The chanting monks in the opening theme is emblematic of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; making the score easily recognizable by even a casual fan.  The score has been given the full orchestral treatment and feels&amp;#8230;different. Not deeper or grander, just different. It&amp;#8217;s worth a separate listen. If you&amp;#8217;re a purist, selection of the original score can be done in the options menu. Both scores have their merits. Further audio work has been done on all of the weaponry and for the first time since &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; the weapons feel suitably beefy. In my co-op playthroughs, my co-op partner remarked that they truly feel like some sort of space cannon. Honestly, it&amp;#8217;s a bit jarring, but in a good way. Blasting a dozen grunts with the full discharge of the 60 round assault rifle clip while running down a hallway is more than just an assault on alien scum- it&amp;#8217;s a treat for the senses of the player.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_496" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-halo-anniversary/attachment/anniversary8/" rel="attachment wp-att-496"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Anniversary8-1024x576.jpg" alt="Spartans, Halo Anniversary, multiplayer" title="Anniversary8" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-496" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blasting away in multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in the press cycle for &lt;em&gt;Halo: Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of noise was made about how the multiplayer was going to work. I predicted that it would be in only &lt;em&gt;Halo:Reach&lt;/em&gt;, and I was partially correct. If you launch multiplayer from the &lt;em&gt;Halo:Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; disk, you are in your own matchmaking hopper, but it&amp;#8217;s still in the &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; engine and matchmaking playlist designed for it. It was just mashed with old school &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; gameplay as best as they could manage. It&amp;#8217;s very close, but not quite identical. The three-shot pistol is back, and with it comes a serious balance issue in multiplayer. Each retail copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo:Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; comes with a token for Xbox Live to allow download of the new maps into the main &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer. Remakes of &lt;em&gt;Beaver Creek, Hang &amp;#8216;Em High, Damnation, Prisoner, and Headlong&lt;/em&gt; are included on the disk and with the install over Xbox Live, as well as a Firefight map based on part of the campaign level &amp;#8220;Halo.&amp;#8221; It was about time for a map pack for &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; anyway. The fan community around the game is pretty vocal about every issue that changes the beloved franchise, but I think that the integration of the old maps into the &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer engine is the best case scenario that will irritate the fewest amount of people. Having very specific and discrete &lt;em&gt;Halo Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer isolated from &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer would have raised hell with the online matchmaking population that&amp;#8217;s already heavily split between many AAA titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_495" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-halo-anniversary/attachment/anniversary7/" rel="attachment wp-att-495"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Anniversary7-1024x576.jpg" alt="Halo Anniversary, Matchmaking" title="Anniversary7" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-495" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;More dramatic Halo pummeling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is the first game series that I think has been unjustly painted by gamer hipsterism. There is no reason to dislike a game simply because of it&amp;#8217;s popularity. There is a great deal of room in the industry for blockbusters, ongoing series, little indie titles, retro gamers, music game enthusiasts, and JRPG players to name a few. As such, &lt;em&gt;Halo: Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t going to be for everybody. Other reviews have complained that there&amp;#8217;s not a lot to the package for your $39.99. I disagree. For that price, the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fan gets six multiplayer maps and a firefight map for &lt;em&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/em&gt; as well as a campaign that while painted as repetitive, still offers a great deal of gameplay variety and replayability. As an added bonus, the campaign is longer than modern single player campaigns as found in titles such as &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare 3&lt;/em&gt;. Who should buy this game? Even at the lower than normal holiday release price point of $39.99 if you don&amp;#8217;t like &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; for whatever reason you may have you won&amp;#8217;t like &lt;em&gt;Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re going to get the maps for &lt;em&gt;Reach&lt;/em&gt; you may as well drop the extra cash on the campaign too. Gaming&amp;#8217;s path over the last ten years has been driven by the effects of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; on the console ecosystem. If you were too young to have appreciated how the story actually started, now&amp;#8217;s a good time to get on board.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game was purchased by the reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Have you had a hankering for a little more &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; lately?

Good news for you then faithful Ferelden fan. &lt;a href="http://www.bioware.com/"&gt;Bioware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/"&gt;Dark Horse Comics&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that a digital comic series will be coming down the pipeline in February 2012.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you had a hankering for a little more &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; lately? Perhaps the recently launched DLC &lt;em&gt;Mark of the Assassin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/show/dragonageredemption"&gt;Dragon Age: Redemption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; webseries featuring Felicia Day wasn’t enough to hold you over? Good news for you then faithful Ferelden fan. &lt;a href="http://www.bioware.com/"&gt;Bioware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/"&gt;Dark Horse Comics&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that a digital comic series will be coming down the pipeline in February 2012. At the low price of $0.99 per issue, the six issue series will be easily affordable. The issues will cover some of the more well-known and often lusted after characters you’d be familiar with (We’re looking at you Alistair).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-477"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Written by David Gaider, leader writer and creator of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; brings forth tales of a group of heroes traveling to Antivia a far off land ruled by assassins. Don’t let it frighten you that some of your former companions are teaming up for a new adventure. As Gaider has been the lead writer on the property since the beginning (on top of writing novels in the universe), I’m sure that everything is in good hands. Chad Hardin is handling the art duties. With titles like &lt;em&gt;Farscape&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Web of Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; under his belt, I think the pages will be looking fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, keep playing away in the universe of the Gray Wardens with your friends through the tabletop RPG from &lt;a href="http://www.greenronin.com/store/category/dragon_age.html"&gt;Green Ronin&lt;/a&gt;. Tabletop not your thing? The next book by Gaider, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/dragonageasunder/DavidGaider"&gt;Dragon Age: Asunder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is set to release at the end of the year. If the thought of reading puts you off a little, Bioware has planned an anime produced in conjunction with Funimation. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.funimation.com/dragon-age-movie"&gt;Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; should be making its way to your eyeballs sometime in 2012 (pushed back from a 2011 release).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an all out multimedia blitz by Bioware in order to make a strong brand out of &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;. If they keeping offering us all of these options, I think they won’t have any problem keeping us hungering for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Horror Story&lt;/em&gt; may only be six episodes into its first season, but &lt;a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/"&gt;FX&lt;/a&gt; made the decision to make an early renewal for a second season of the fright-fest. Signing on for a second season of 13 episodes this early means that the cable channel has some high hopes for the show. The Wednesday night horror series is tracking to become the highest-rated series ever for FX. This isn’t a surprise for a show coming from the two people who were pivotal for the success of &lt;em&gt;Nip/Tuck&lt;/em&gt;, one of FX’s first smash hits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-479"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The renewal may have felt a little like a leap of faith for the FX Network as they were in the middle of possibly losing one of their largest carriers- DirecTV. If you were watching the show as the episodes were airing at the time, you would have seen Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk pleading with viewers during commercial breaks. Thankfully, Fox and DirecTV made a last minute deal to keep all of the channels under the Fox banner on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been watching &lt;em&gt;American Horror Story&lt;/em&gt; yet, it is definitely worth giving it a moment of your time. Upon moving to a new home in Los Angeles to escape the troubled life in Boston, the Harmons find themselves with a more complicated set of circumstances with their new home. Unbeknownst to them, the home came with some things that previous owners left behind. I can’t recommend just jumping into it as you will be lost beyond belief. Without going into depth why, let’s just say that the writing is aimed for the long run. We have just begun to see how deeply disturbing the tale of the Harmons is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICAN HORROR STORY FANS GET HALLOWEEN TREAT, NOT TRICKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Hit Drama from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk Gets Second Season Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking to Become Highest Rated 1st Season of Any FX Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four-Episode Halloween Marathon Airs Tonight at 10:00 PM ET/PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nine All-New Episodes Remain in Season One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, October 31, 2011 &amp;#8211; Fans of American Horror Story got a Halloween treat today from FX as the network placed a second-season order of 13 episodes from Twentieth Century Fox Television, announced John Landgraf, President and General Manager, FX Networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Horror Story, created by producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, is the eighth FX drama series to earn a second season order. Nine all-new episodes of AHS remain in the first season airing Wednesdays at 10:00 PM E/P, with the final two episodes airing December 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s one thing to have the ambition and guts to reinvent a genre in a way that makes it captivatingly fresh for a broad audience&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s something else entirely to have the craft to back that ambition up,&amp;#8221; said Landgraf. &amp;#8220;Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have hit the trifecta with Nip/Tuck, Glee and now American Horror Story, which will be scaring FX&amp;#8217;s viewers to death for many years to come.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHS is producing outstanding ratings, growing though its first four weeks in the network&amp;#8217;s target audience of Adults 18-49. On a Live+7 basis, through two weeks, first-run episodes of AHS are averaging 4.2 million Total Viewers, 2.9 million Adults 18-49, and 1.7 million Adults 18-34. It is currently tracking to become the highest-rated first season of any series ever on FX, certain to surpass Murphy&amp;#8217;s award-winning hit drama Nip/Tuck in Adults 18-49 and Adults 18-34 (2.1 million Adults 18-49; 1.0 million Adults 18-34 &amp;#8211; 2003), and also above the award-winning drama Justified in Total Viewers (3.4 million P2+ &amp;#8211; 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Live+3 basis, last week&amp;#8217;s fourth episode was the highest-rated episode of the season in delivery of Adults 18-49 (3.1 million) and Adults 18-34 (1.85 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premiere episode of AHS (most current available) delivered a multi-run telecast audience of 8.0 million Total Viewers, 5.4 million Adults 18-34 and 3.0 million Adults 18-34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series premiere episode of AHS (Oct. 5, 10:00 PM) ranked as the #1 for the network among its target demos of Adults 18-49 and Adults 18-34. It delivered 3.14 million Adults 18-49 and 1.77 million Adults 18-34, which marked enormous gains of +54% and +49% in those demos when compared to the Live+Same Day premiere data. The debut episode of AHS also ranks #1 all-time among FX series premieres in delivery of Women 18-49 and Women 18-34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight beginning at 10:00 PM E/P, FX will air a special Halloween marathon of American Horror Story featuring the first four episodes. In this Wednesday&amp;#8217;s (Nov. 2, 10:00PM E/P) fifth episode, &amp;#8220;Halloween, Part 2&amp;#8243;, Halloween night concludes with Tate (Evan Peters) coming face-to-face with his past, and Ben (Dylan McDermott) and Vivien (Connie Britton) are haunted by one of the house&amp;#8217;s newest guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Horror Story revolves around the Harmons, a family of three who moved from Boston to Los Angeles as a means to reconcile past anguish. The all-star cast features Dylan McDermott as &amp;#8220;Ben Harmon,&amp;#8221; a psychiatrist; Connie Britton as &amp;#8220;Vivien Harmon,&amp;#8221; Ben&amp;#8217;s wife; Taissa Farmiga as &amp;#8220;Violet,&amp;#8221; the Harmon&amp;#8217;s teenage daughter; Jessica Lange in her first-ever regular series TV role as &amp;#8220;Constance,&amp;#8221; the Harmon&amp;#8217;s neighbor; Evan Peters plays &amp;#8220;Tate Langdon,&amp;#8221; one of Ben&amp;#8217;s patients; and Denis O&amp;#8217;Hare as &amp;#8220;Larry Harvey.&amp;#8221; Guest stars for the series include Frances Conroy as the Harmon&amp;#8217;s housekeeper; Alexandra Breckenridge as the Harmon&amp;#8217;s housekeeper; and Jamie Brewer as Constance&amp;#8217;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Horror Story was co-created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, who serve as Executive Producers along with Dante Di Loreto. The series is produced by Twentieth Century Fox Television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Chairmen Gary Newman and Dana Walden, Twentieth Century Fox Television is the prolific producer of a wide range of award-winning blockbuster network and cable series including &amp;#8220;Glee,&amp;#8221; the two-time Golden Globe winner for Best Series, Comedy or Musical and &amp;#8220;Modern Family,&amp;#8221; the two-time Emmy winner for Outstanding Comedy Series. Twentieth Century Fox Television comprises the flagship studio, as well as sister companies Fox 21 and Fox Television Studios, and currently has more than thirty series on the air domestically and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gameflood, Gamepocalypse, Gamevalanche, call this typhoon of titles what you will, it’s overwhelming. As a student, I barely have enough money for all these games, let alone enough time. As the employee of a gaming retail store, I barely have enough patience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-483"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No, not just because of customers. I deal with difficult people on a daily basis, it’s part of any retail job. The real thorn in my side is a subset of a subset of customers. The larger subset is those who attend midnight launches, the smaller subset are those who partake in some atrociously frustrating activities while attending these midnight launches. So, if you’re going to a midnight launch (like the many occurring this evening), I’ve got some helpful do’s and don’ts to make sure you don’t get on the bad side of your local game store employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T bang on the front doors before the store opens. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. When you do this, you don&amp;#8217;t look like an obnoxious tool, you are an obnoxious tool. How would you like it if someone came to your house before you were ready to wake up and just started ringing your doorbell and banging on your door? You wouldn’t, and while we’re not sleeping in there, we’re still working, and if we aren’t working, we’re inhaling before we have to repeat the same schpiel 200 times over the course of 2 hours. Cut us some slack. We may not be a skilled trade, but retail is a shitty job sometimes, and it makes us feel good when the person on the other side of the counter isn’t a dick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T be indecisive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate this type of person the most. Most corporate instructions state that you are actually allowed to browse around for whatever you want, but as the person who has to wait for you, I hate your guts. This goes for being indecisive about most anything (for example, collector’s edition, console, scratch guarantee). We have to serve lots of people other than you, and normally it’s OK to browse, but now is not the time! Know what you want, get in, get out, and go home to play your damn game so that we can do the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO be friendly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough. We’re tired. It’s midnight, we don’t really want to be here for very long. We’re doing this as a courtesy to you. In fact, a large majority of midnight launches are done at the discretion of the manager and staff, so a “thank you” wouldn’t hurt. Being chatty but not overbearing is also a plus. Everybody likes to be engaged at work so it’s perfectly fine to make jokes, talk about the games, all that stuff. We often thrive in environments where we can engage with our own culture, so the time passes by faster, and you (usually) get some good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO be patient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, this should be in a shopping 101 textbook. It isn’t limited to midnight launches, but it’s especially important at them. We have an immediate influx of customers, but we still have to tell you about all of our add-ons and whatnot. Honestly, most of us will suggest things that we think would be of use to you, so don’t interrupt us (again, we want to get out of there as much as you), and politely say “no” if you’re not interested. It’s really that simple, there’s no need to tell me how stupid those gaming glasses are, or how expensive the headset is. I KNOW. I recommended it either because a) there’s a promotion to save YOU money, b) because I believe it would enhance your enjoyment of the game, or c) both. &lt;em&gt;(editor&amp;#8217;s note: there are situations where the employee is required by corporate direction to suggest an add-on, like Applecare at Apple Stores.  If you don&amp;#8217;t want it, don&amp;#8217;t be a dick about it, just politely say no)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T say I’m only recommending something because I want your money.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a god damn retail store, of course we want your money, what rock have you been living under? Wanting your money does not preclude wanting you to have the best possible experience with your new game. I take pride in knowing that people are getting an enhanced experience by means of a product I recommended. We live in a society fueled by money, expecting me to not care about making money is ridiculous, but don’t think that wanting your money means I’m blind to what you actually want (though I did see you eyeing that Hello Kitty DS case, It’s only 24.99!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO have fun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the most important thing. If we aren’t creating an environment for fun, then why are we doing a midnight? I know some stores are different, choosing to be apathetic about the new games, but specialty gaming stores like mine take a lot of pride in fostering a community of customers and creating an event for them. That’s what midnight launches should be about: celebrating the launch of your anticipated game with fun, (maybe) food, and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whichever game you’re picking up tonight (there are about 7 of them coming out), or whenever you go to a midnight launch, remember these rules, and you’ll be well on your way to becoming a fondly-remembered customer, which is a lot better than being the grumpy storm cloud that all your local game store employees curse. Happy gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Das Kalk&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>So yeah... During the start of recording this week the record button click didn't quite take. Sue me. We got our wits about us pretty quick and still covered our normal insane topics, though! Maybe next time I can pay a little bit better attention if things are going or not. We go over:Adobe not developing flash for mobiles, and layoffs,  Why no guest?

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So yeah&amp;#8230; During the start of recording this week the record button click didn&amp;#8217;t quite take. Sue me. We got our wits about us pretty quick and still covered our normal insane topics, though! Maybe next time I can pay a little bit better attention if things are going or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we went over the following topics of conversation more than once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com"&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt; not developing flash for mobiles, and layoffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why no guest? &lt;em&gt;Skyrim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Creation Station for &lt;em&gt;Saints Row 3&lt;/em&gt; has generated over a million characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What, exactly is &lt;em&gt;The Penetrator&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.marvel.com"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-tablet-barnes-noble/1104687969?"&gt;Nook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.comixology.com/"&gt;Comixology&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Fire-Amazon-Tablet/dp/B0051VVOB2"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The RIAA says the DMCA isn&amp;#8217;t helping them enough. Damned courts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Everquest II&lt;/em&gt; has gone free to play. Look for Draeno!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://company.zynga.com/"&gt;Zynga&lt;/a&gt; to Employees- Give back ur stocks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/ratfist-collection-take-to-print-by-image-comics/attachment/ratfist-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-427"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Ratfist-Banner.jpg" alt="Ratfist, webcomic, Image Comics, Doug TenNapel, Earthworm Jim, Ethan Nicole, Skottie Young, print, must read" title="Ratfist-Banner" width="660" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-427" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of &lt;a href="http://www.tennapel.com/"&gt;Doug TenNapel&lt;/a&gt;, think back to some of the days of your childhood. Had you owned a Sega Genesis, you would definitely remember a body of work that he was responsible for. A mutated worm living in a space suit perhaps? Ringing any bells? If you were at all interested by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm_Jim"&gt;Earthworm Jim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll be happy to know that his creator’s newest comic creation found a home on the web. &lt;em&gt;Ratfist&lt;/em&gt;, a 150 page opus, tells the tale of Ricky (aka Ratfist) and his misbegotten super hero adventures with partners Milt and his uh, rather unique form of conscious. In a story that combines comedy, deceit, action, and a heaping pile of weirdness, &lt;em&gt;Ratfist&lt;/em&gt; should entertain just about anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Mr. TenNapel as put a wrap on his story of human exploration, it has been announced that it will be going into print. &lt;a href="http://www.imagecomics.com/"&gt;Image Comics&lt;/a&gt; stepped into to publish &lt;em&gt;Ratfist&lt;/em&gt; as a 176 page graphic novel with all of the glory of the comic as it appeared on the Internet. TenNapel had this to say when asked how he felt about it being put out by Image, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m so thrilled that this can join the line up of books I&amp;#8217;ve brought to Image,&amp;#8221; said TenNapel. &amp;#8220;I hope those that missed it when I was publishing online get to pick it up now in print!&amp;#8221; For those of you who think that they’ve seen everything offered on the comic’s website, you’ll be a little mistaken. Art by some other big names, including &lt;a href="http://www.axecop.com"&gt;Ethan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.bearmageddon.com/"&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.skottieyoung.com/"&gt;Skottie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skottie_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/a&gt;, has been added to the collection. Look for it at shop near you starting December 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless if you are interested in &lt;em&gt;Ratfist&lt;/em&gt; coming to print or not, you need to read it. &lt;a href="http://www.ratfist.com/"&gt;As in go do it right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a comic on the web for free. What’s stopping you?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-world-of-keflings-and-it-came-from-outer-space-dlc-xbla/attachment/worldofkeflings-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-527"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/worldofkeflings-banner.jpg" alt="Don&amp;#039;t Feed the trolls, review, It Came From Outer Space, NinjaBee, Keflings, xBox Live, Avatar, World of Keflings, Castle, King is a dick, " title="worldofkeflings-banner" width="660" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-527" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kings in video games are dicks.  Go here, fetch that, kill rats, make a massive ball of things you roll over, go save the princess.  What do you get for your service to the crown?  Usually a trinket or two, maybe a pittance of gold.  World of Keflings has a King.  Perhaps if he realized the non-trivial nature of his castle building tasks, maybe he&amp;#8217;d throw you a freaking bone or something.  World of Keflings, the second title in the series from NinjaBee was released in January, well before this podcast even started.  Just before Halloween, the first downloadable content for it, the &amp;#8220;It Came From Outer Space&amp;#8221; alien-themed world pack shipped.  We already know from a previous title that the Keflings are all about doing your bidding so you can provide a palatial estate for the King, but how deep does the game get?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-471"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_474" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-world-of-keflings-and-it-came-from-outer-space-dlc-xbla/attachment/keflingsforest/" rel="attachment wp-att-474"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/keflingsforest.jpg" alt="World of Keflings, Forest World" title="keflingsforest" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-474" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Most of your game is here in the forest world.  At least mine was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any given Keflings title is an exercise in resource harvesting and management.  Any Keflings title can be simply described as a light version of later Sim City titles.  Playing as your xBox Live avatar you send your minions, the Keflings, out to collect, harvest, or otherwise gather construction materials so you can ultimately build a castle for the Kefling King.  While accumulating these materials your goal is to build your buildings and advance along a rudimentary technology tree.   During all of this gathering and building, various tasks pop up allowing you to collect more advanced blueprints to construct fantastical structures on your way to build the castle.  As far as construction sandboxes go World of Keflings is low-stress.  There are no significant disasters, no alien invasions, or dragon attacks (although one will perch menacingly forcing you to shoo it away to build what and how you want).  Nothing else really goes on to disturb your path to victory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_473" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-world-of-keflings-and-it-came-from-outer-space-dlc-xbla/attachment/keflingsdesert/" rel="attachment wp-att-473"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/keflingsdesert-1024x576.jpg" alt="Desert world, World of Keflings" title="keflingsdesert" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-473" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There are resources to be had in the desert too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is not total harmony.  Keflings are lazy creatures.  If your charges are being slothful, a swift kick or slap atop the head will set them right.  In an interesting feature, if a slap atop the head is delivered properly, it can level up your builder!  About the most trouble you can have in the game is if a miscreant joins over xBox Live and decides to destroy your buildings.  If you are hosting, you have the power to dispatch the miscreant from whence they came.  If you as the host quit or are disconnected, whoever is selected as the host gets to save the progress and call it their own.  Seems reasonable, but please, don&amp;#8217;t feed the trolls.  Don&amp;#8217;t rage quit on griefers and reward their behavior- just boot them!  If you&amp;#8217;re not feeling like hitting the wilds of the internet for companions, World of Keflings does allow you to venture forth split screen with buddy.  I heartily endorse this method- face to face communications are simpler and less prone to miscommunication.  Plus, if you&amp;#8217;re a guy trying to get his gaming-hostile girl into gaming, a Keflings title is an excellent starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_476" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-world-of-keflings-and-it-came-from-outer-space-dlc-xbla/attachment/spacekeflings/" rel="attachment wp-att-476"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/spacekeflings.jpg" alt="World of Keflings, It Came From Outer Space" title="spacekeflings" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-476" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Keflings in Spaaaaace!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of the October DLC, there are now four primary Kefling worlds.  You start the game frozen in an ice block in the tundra, and gradually repair the portals to the other worlds.  The Forest world is the most similar to Kingdom of Keflings.  The desert has been added to the main game.  It Came from Outer Space has been added by the DLC, and has it&amp;#8217;s own goals unique to itself.  Rather than directly influencing the castle construction underway, you have to gather different resources than in the main game to assist in the repair of a crashed space ship.  I found that even with the space world&amp;#8217;s goal being right in my gaming wheelhouse I spent most of my time in the Forest world, if for no other reasons than plentiful large trees and the overarching goal of building the King his castle.  I found the desert too sparse and small to be that productive, and the new space world, while entertaining, was a bit arduous to build on given it&amp;#8217;s convoluted layout and odd placement of resources.  I found myself, for lack of a better term, strip mining resources or clear cutting space forests to be able to access the entire map.  NinjaBee is pretty good at checks and balances in game design, so this is probably a design choice.  As a player, I felt a bit constrained by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own one Keflings title, and are just a casual fan of no conflict world building games, you&amp;#8217;re probably set with the version you have.  If you&amp;#8217;re on the fence, then World of Keflings is the go-to title between the two.  If you&amp;#8217;re a fan of NinjaBee or the Keflings, then it&amp;#8217;s probably worth owning both titles.  If you&amp;#8217;ve got to have violence with your world building, avoid any Kefling title- it&amp;#8217;s just not how NinjaBee is rolling with this franchise!  The It Came from Outer Space DLC, while not a perfect add-on world does as it promises.  For 320 points, it adds about three hours to the overall length of the game.  As a bonus, it is graphically interesting and differentiated from the other worlds.  World of Keflings is a good God-style game, regardless of which version you own, be it Kingdom or World.  &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Every now and then I see a hardcore strategy game that looks appealing to me. I don't know why it is, but there is something that pulls me into the depth of the world that they create. When I noticed &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; came in for review, I decide that I would give it a go. I had been eyeing it for sometime as I had let &lt;em&gt;Total War: Shogun II&lt;/em&gt; pass by earlier in the year. Feudal Japan is one of those points in history that feels just ripe for today's market. I couldn't wait to see what it would be like to have my own kuni and fly a clan banner. Thing is, I think that &lt;a href="http://www.paradoxplaza.com/"&gt;Paradox Interactive&lt;/a&gt; might have gone a little too far with this one.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-468"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Banner.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Banner" width="682" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-468" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then I see a hardcore strategy game that looks appealing to me. I don&amp;#8217;t know why it is, but there is something that pulls me into the depth of the world that they create. When I noticed &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; came in for review, I decide that I would give it a go. I had been eyeing it for sometime as I had let &lt;em&gt;Total War: Shogun II&lt;/em&gt; pass by earlier in the year. Feudal Japan is one of those points in history that feels just ripe for today&amp;#8217;s market. I couldn&amp;#8217;t wait to see what it would be like to have my own kuni and fly a clan banner. Thing is, I think that &lt;a href="http://www.paradoxplaza.com/"&gt;Paradox Interactive&lt;/a&gt; might have gone a little too far with this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; you take on the role of clan leader in this point in history, around 1400 AD to be more specific. You rule your demesne that you&amp;#8217;ve chose based on location in the country. Your goal &amp;#8211; to control 50% to Japan in order to be granted the title of Shogun. This is done through a variety of diplomatic endeavors, gift giving, war, and even assassination. How you choose to do it in the end will be up to you. Just don&amp;#8217;t expect to be able to avoid diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_458" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-seige/" rel="attachment wp-att-458"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Seige.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Seige" width="800" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-458" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Attempting to battle for new lands isn&amp;#039;t as simple as walking over to them and attacking. Balancing defenses, army size and type, as well as morale become parts of the equation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing up &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; for the first time made everything seem really simple and straight forward. The menus are simple- select your option and move forward without any fuss. Even when setting up a single player game, it gave you a lot of the information you would need to know. You could launch a scenario that would have presets already figured out for you. Land was already divided among the clans, tensions between clans were calculated, and difficulties were figured with those items in mind. Controls could also be considered just as easy as most things were controlled by the mouse, with hot keys and alt-clicks to cover all of your other needs. So everything seemed good to go, right? Click start and get to your land ruling. Not so fast, there seems to be something missing. A full tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_461" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-tooltips/" rel="attachment wp-att-461"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Tooltips.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Tooltips" width="800" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-461" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Windows such as the one pictured often appear when clicking through random things when you start playing Sengoku. This is about all you get for guidance from the title- a mash-up of half information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most games have a tutorial built into the beginning missions or a part that must be completed prior to moving on to the real parts of the game. This ensures that the player has a rudimentary understanding of how the game is to be played. There is no such thing in &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt;. You are tossed into your region with no idea what the hell to do. To be fair, there are tool tips that cover just about every option you can click into in the control bar. The problem is, there are some things it just doesn&amp;#8217;t explain to the person at the keyboard. After tinkering with it for a few games, you can get the gist. I&amp;#8217;m sure a bit more assistance would have helped at the start though. Even the power of the Internet yielded few tips other than suggested build paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that takes us to the crux of what I would say is wrong with &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt;. The learning curve is brutal. This goes beyond the previous problem of not knowing how it functions, but into the heart of the game. There are over 400 unique characters in the game. Guess what- you are going to have to maintain your relationships with them all. There are some easy fixes like marriage, land and title grants, and the almighty gold coin. Then you have examine the perks of the characters and how you view them to see if there is risk for revolt. That only solves so many problems. Then, if you are at war, there are whole different sets of things that you need to hand hold; such as searching for wandering ronin to bolster you armies, creating plots against other clans, and even inciting discontent in your neighbor&amp;#8217;s lands. You only have three cabinet members to help you do all this. Each cabinet member holds a specific skill set for homeland development/defense, creating favorable faction relationships, and trying to undermine other provinces. It almost makes the whole thing overwhelming. Way too many things to micromanage. So many in fact, that it makes it seem like all you are doing the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_457" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-menus/" rel="attachment wp-att-457"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Menus.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Menus" width="800" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-457" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Menus will probably be the thing you end up looking at the most as you start your eternal diplomatic balancing act. Good thing they are clear, easy to read, and offer all the details you could want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#8217;t to say that everything is horrible or wretched about &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt;. Most of my complaints about the title would most likely be seen as something positive to the people that this game is marketed to, and that is probably the biggest problem. &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; will not find a home with casual players. It is a deep, deep strategy game. Meticulous and long term planning are actually encouraged to ensure victory. In the future, it would have paid off to plot in order to gain footholds with other territories. I would think it creates a scenario to be a hardcore strategist&amp;#8217;s wet dream, especially if they are history buffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_460" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-moving-support/" rel="attachment wp-att-460"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Moving-Support.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Moving-Support" width="800" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-460" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You&amp;#039;ll find out many times that you bit off more than you can chew when you start trying to take over by force. You can choose to retreat or wait for reinforcements to arrive. Remember that your troops are traveling across Japan, so it will take some time to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is aimed to be period accurate, from the music to the artwork. Even the UI is weathered a little to make it appear not so out of time and place. They often are clear and a bonus to the point enough to add to the experience. Provinces are split to the appropriate political and geographical boundaries. Characters are even dressed for the times. The look and feel of the game is well beyond what a person would normally expect for such a title. The maps that everything takes place on are beautiful. That goes for all of the five different options you have to look at too. Be it color coding by empire or the very well detailed topographical look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_459" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-sengoku-pc/attachment/sengoku-top-map/" rel="attachment wp-att-459"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Sengoku-Top-Map.jpg" alt="Sengoku, Japan, Feudal, Paradox Interative, Shogun, strategy, learning curve, tutorial, maps, menus, war, diplomacy" title="Sengoku-Top-Map" width="800" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-459" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The maps created for Sengoku were just beautiful. By spinning the camera around and getting different views of the scenery, you really developed an appreciation for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start I could tell that &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; was going to be a title that had a very niche audience. While I could see the strengths for the title, I considered many of them to be a negative from my personal standpoint. That said, this is from someone who spends their working life in a finance department. The last thing I want to do when I get home is start plugging away at something that reminds me of working on spreadsheets. To really appreciate &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; a gamer will have to have the copious amount of time it takes to learn and master, and the will to manage everything down to some of the finite details that have been implemented. Does that mean it is a bad game? No, not at all. It just lacks some of the basics to make it accessible for everyone. Paradox has a tendency to create these limited scope games. I really wish they would look towards gamers as a whole. &lt;em&gt;Sengoku&lt;/em&gt; has the ability to be the next logical step from RTS games into something with a little more thought. Until the curve is somewhat less steep, it may as well to the honorable thing and throw itself on its sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game provided by developer for review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>There is something that I don’t get when it comes to our societal love for the characters we create in fantasy settings. It seems like often people aim to be elves, other worldly creatures, or even great human heroes that they could never been in this day in age. You know who always gets left the short end of the stick? Dwarves. You hardly see anyone playing our fierce-hearted bearded brethren in a serious manner. Sure, &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; series had their share of dwarves. Ask yourself this though; didn’t they just play second fiddle to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit"&gt;Hobbits&lt;/a&gt;? With the sheer number of characters you would have thought that someone would have been important enough for some face time. And those dwarves with Snow White? No chance either.

It is possible that they might have a shot at redemption. Lunar Giant Studios aimed to garner them some respect with their adventure/strategy game &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt;.  </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-456"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Banner.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Banner" width="682" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-456" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something that I don’t get when it comes to our societal love for the characters we create in fantasy settings. It seems like often people aim to be elves, other worldly creatures, or even great human heroes that they could never been in this day in age. You know who always gets left the short end of the stick? Dwarves. You hardly see anyone playing our fierce-hearted bearded brethren in a serious manner. Sure, &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; series had their share of dwarves. Ask yourself this though; didn’t they just play second fiddle to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit"&gt;Hobbits&lt;/a&gt;? With the sheer number of characters you would have thought that someone would have been important enough for some face time. And those dwarves with Snow White? No chance either. Even the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kender"&gt;Kender&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance"&gt;Dragonlance&lt;/a&gt; universe got more dues. It is possible that they might have a shot at redemption. &lt;a href="http://www.lunargiantstudios.com/"&gt;Lunar Giant Studios&lt;/a&gt; aimed to garner them some respect with their adventure/strategy game &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-451"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Well, respect might not be the correct word in this case. Not since &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; have we had the focal point of a game feature our hearty warriors and workers from under the mountains in anything resembling a starring role. The King pulls the focus back to himself&amp;#8211; I mean his people with a royal decree! In his gobbledy goop sort of language he demands to his subjects that he is in need of more wealth! As he is your liege, the duties fall upon you and your group of five miners, scouts and fighters. Where does one go to get said wealth for the King? The natural place for dwarves to look, mines! You will dig deep into the mountains, creating tunnels, harvesting precious gems and metals, and discovering long lost treasures. Piece of cake, right? Not so! There are other teams of subjects trying to lay claim to the vast riches. They’ll be all rough and tumble about it too as all bets are off when it comes to getting the King what he wants. There will also be a fight coming from the denizens of the underground consisting of goblins, gnomes, evil dwarves and even dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_463" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-relics/" rel="attachment wp-att-463"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Relics.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Relics" width="800" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-463" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Relics can deliver a bigger bonus to the King&amp;#039;s coffers. They could also been a boon to your existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; is a really straight forward turn based strategy game. Each team alternates a set of three different phases in order to gather the most glistening purities for their newly commissioned, kingly coffers. First is the digging phase where you must select a pre-set tile to place on an appropriate blank spot on the map. There are three different tiers of tunnels depending on the ground you are tunneling into. Those make up depths of dirt, stone and deep. Step number two is where all the strategic positioning takes place. During this time, you move around your five guys to either be in a position to pick at the walls to collect wealth, fight, explore, or turn in the trip’s haul. Once you are done there, you move to the third and final stage- collection! Here all your items are added to your dwarf’s inventories, counted when they are turned in at your lift or gnome exchange, or remain on their person if the squad members are slackers. Depending on the map, you can start at 14 turns or stretch it as far as 25. Fighting comes after the monsters take their movement. Pretty simple turn order wouldn’t you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_467" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-tiles/" rel="attachment wp-att-467"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Tiles.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Tiles" width="800" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-467" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The board gives you plenty of options when placing a tile during the first phase of your turn. Remember, your object is to get the richest minerals from the deepest parts of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go along with a simple game play, the graphics are easy on the eyes. &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t need to be the flashiest thing on the planet. It only needed enough graphics to get the point across. Using a traditional 2D look with animated characters does just the trick. The best way I can describe how the characters look is Super Nintendo-era sprites just punched up some more. I’d almost liken the dwarves and their actions to that of a fancier version of &lt;em&gt;Golden Axe&lt;/em&gt; on the arcade. Textures, like the dirt and stone, is not unlike many games from the late 90s. They are much better looking, but have that classic clods of dirt thrown together look. Overall the shading, lighting, and coloring are better than what we’d expect from something almost 20 years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_462" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-battle/" rel="attachment wp-att-462"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Battle.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Battle" width="800" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-462" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The fighting portion of the game moves through pretty quickly. The King will heckle everyone along the way, but really it is in good fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; has to be that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. If you can imagine if a gerbil and &lt;a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Murloc"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; had a baby, that’s what the King sounds like. Yeah, that’s right. Get that image out of your head. To go along with that, &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; isn’t afraid of a cheap joke or bad pun. Dwarves are assigned random names like Tom and MacDuck, but also some common dwarf names from fiction. Every team name the game comes up with is just silly. It even extends as far as the relic names and abilities. The game reserves the special kind of naming hell for the gnome wizards though. Sir Bedwetter? Tell me he wasn’t mocked at wizard school. The King is always cracking wise when things happen as well, like death or if a player turns in a treasure. Even with how goofy the game can be, the comedy doesn’t distract from the simple strategy. Thinking out your steps rarely goes past the actual movement phase. It is a smart move to make sure that you end up at something you can mine at the end of your movement points. AI is setup so the computer controlled players will always seek out a fight if it is something they can reach during their movement phase. The touch here adds that little spark of excitement where it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_466" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-names/" rel="attachment wp-att-466"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Names.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Names" width="800" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-466" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is the perfect example of just how obsurd some of the naming can be in Delve Deeper. I&amp;#039;m shocked the team name wasn&amp;#039;t &amp;quot;My Five Bruces.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t suffer much at the hand of flaws either. During my testing, there were only two that I ran into. The first will be a big one if people don’t choose to take sixty seconds or less to do some &lt;a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1701683"&gt;Internet searches&lt;/a&gt; if bought on Steam. For whatever reason, Steam doesn’t like to launch the C++ distributable package after you download and launch for the first time. The files are downloaded to the game directory, just not executed when you start the game. The other flaw is a very tiny one. During the review every time I would take a screenshot the game would switch from a windowed mode to being full screen. A command to bring the game to full screen is bound to the universal Steam screenshot key. Doing it too many times will also make the game crash. Correcting this is as easy as re-assigning the command in your Steam settings to something that isn’t used in the game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_465" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-delve-deeper-pc/attachment/delve-deeper-winning/" rel="attachment wp-att-465"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Delve-Deeper-Winning.jpg" alt="Delve Deeper, dwarves, dwarf, Lunar Giant Studios, hobbit, kender, pc, steam, dragonlance, strategy, turn based," title="Delve-Deeper-Winning" width="800" height="450" class="size-full wp-image-465" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hooray, confetti! I won! Notice how even the losers get a nifty title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; is a tremendously fun game. It’s a game that will have you laughing at just how harebrained it can be. The value of such fun looks even greater when you look at the piddly amount it costs. On Steam you can pick up the original game with the &lt;em&gt;Treasures and Tunnels&lt;/em&gt; expansion for only $5.49. &lt;em&gt;Treasures and Tunnels&lt;/em&gt; added 10 levels and 25 new relics to the game. Not bad for $1.00. If you’d like to get it from other sources, look no further than direct from &lt;a href="http://www.lunargiantstudios.com/"&gt;Lunar Giant&lt;/a&gt; for $5.00. It is well worth that price. It makes me a little sad that this isn’t on the iTunes store. &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; would easily make a killing as an iOS game. We have spoken with the developer regarding this, and while there are no plans to make &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt; an iOS title, they are in the opening stages of its sequel &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper: The Deepening&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Deepening&lt;/em&gt; may end up on the iOS. Graphics, gameplay, and comedy have most any other casual title beat with just those features. Also, this game can be setup in a window on a second monitor. You could easily take your turns while your raid prepares for a fight or are waiting for everyone to run back after a wipe. Lunar Giant struck it rich with &lt;em&gt;Delve Deeper&lt;/em&gt;. An accessible game was built that is easy to grasp, fun, and should have you chuckling as you dig on. Dig in! (See what I did there?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game provided by developer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>A few big name game journalists are lamenting the state of our hobby and their profession.  I'd like to clear up a few points about how we do things here at 20SON.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had a few emails from listeners after we &amp;#8220;aired&amp;#8221; the most recent episode of the podcast in regards to our reviews.  A couple of &lt;a href="http://www.gamefront.com/what-a-reviewers-job-is-not/" target="_blank"&gt;big-name&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/717762/uncharted-3-and-the-problem-with-review-scores-sesslers-soapbox/ " target="_blank"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.joystickdivision.com/2011/10/whats_killing_games_journalism.php" target="_blank"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; are lamenting the state of our hobby and their profession as well.  So, I guess it was an interesting week to talk about how we do reviews here at 20SON.  I&amp;#8217;d like to clear up a few points.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-449"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What We&amp;#8217;ll Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, we try and find time to review everything we get our grubby little mitts on, whether it&amp;#8217;s been provided for us for review or we purchased it.  We do try and acquire review product for the site by emailing press contacts to see what we can get that either we&amp;#8217;re interested in, or we think our readership/listenership might find entertaining to find out about.  We do not change our review methodology between products we received for review from the publisher or products we purchase ourselves.  We do state at the tail end of a review if we purchased the item ourselves, or if it was provided to us by the publisher as required by &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005endorsementguidesfnnotice.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;16 CFR Part 255&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Both Draeno and I grew up knowing that anything was worth playing, if even for a single moment of fun.  Sure, we&amp;#8217;ve played some overall turkeys, but even the turkeys have some good points- it&amp;#8217;s just a matter of finding them, and knowing what we&amp;#8217;d want to pay for them.  There are good games and bad, just like there are good movies and bad, but good and bad is all relative.  The difference between a good movie and bad is whether or not you catch it in the theater, rent it from iTunes, buy it on DVD, or wait until it&amp;#8217;s on HBO.  We here at 20SON think that there&amp;#8217;s a similar equation for games.  We do try to let you know what the ideal market for a game or product is, and who should buy it now, and what groups or tastes should wait to buy on sale, on steep sale, or just play the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Why no scores, man?&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scores are arbitrary.  Besides, what&amp;#8217;s the scale?  Does a scale of 1-5 equate to the 50-100 percent ratings on most sites, or is the 1-5 scale equate to the 1-100 scale.  How do you judge the scale?  What&amp;#8217;s a game that rates a 1 or a 5?  Is there even a perfect game?  Will a &amp;#8220;perfect&amp;#8221; game today still be perfect in a year?  All of these factors make percentages, starts, skulls, or what have you completely arbitrary and of little use.  If we do a review this week, we want you to be able to google the review in a year, and it still have applicability, and we don&amp;#8217;t think a percent/star system makes this any clearer.  It is true that some of our reviews are syndicated on other venues and they do have stars or percentages.  Those are applied as per the requirements of the syndicated site.  We retain our value and market paragraph on reviews of ours that you see elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re very positive with your reviews.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every product we review here is looked at with the same critical eye, regardless of source.  We&amp;#8217;re a small outfit, with many demands on our time both personally and professionally outside of the 20SON website.  Draeno and I are the primary writers, with periodic help from a few others who we clearly identify.  If a review says &amp;#8220;20SON Review&amp;#8221;, then Draeno or I wrote the review.  The writer of a guest review is clearly stated.  These reviews are edited by either Draeno or I prior to publication.  We do prioritize products we purchase or request for review on existing interests, the same as you do.  We won&amp;#8217;t buy anything we don&amp;#8217;t want to personally play.  While we&amp;#8217;ll still review Barbie&amp;#8217;s Horse Adventure III if we&amp;#8217;re provided it, we&amp;#8217;d prefer to be reviewing something like &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Marine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as they&amp;#8217;re more our cup of tea.  As such, we don&amp;#8217;t have many negative sounding reviews, at least not yet.  We&amp;#8217;re not listed in Metacritic, nor are we likely to ever be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#8217;re two guys on the internet, writing about what appeals to us.  We&amp;#8217;ve got opinions about stuff, and we hope you like reading them or hearing us discuss them in the beginning of your week.  Neither of us are particularly fond of scores on reviews, so we don&amp;#8217;t do them here, but we do periodically have to add them depending on demands from us from other press outlets.  You won&amp;#8217;t see scores here, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to tell you what we think about something, no matter where we got it from.  We&amp;#8217;ll tell you if we think it blows, even if it&amp;#8217;s an unpopular opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>This "toy" has caught a lot of flak from parenting groups saying that giving your toddler a $300 iDevice isn't a good idea, but let's look at it a little closer.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fisher-price-laugh-and-play-apptivity-idevice-case/attachment/fisher-price-llac/" rel="attachment wp-att-524"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-524 aligncenter" title="fisher-price-llac" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/fisher-price-llac.jpg" alt="Apptivity, Laugh and Play, Fisher Price, iPhone, iPod Touch, case" width="660" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a child in the house that covets my iPhone like nothing else. He has an assortment of favorite toys and other things, but as soon as the phone comes out, it&amp;#8217;s like he&amp;#8217;s possessed by the ghost of Steve. He lunges, he dives, and throws a bit of a fit if he isn&amp;#8217;t allowed to at least handle it for a minute. I don&amp;#8217;t have dropped calls from AT+T, I have disconnections caused by little fingers grasping at the device. We do have some apps for him that he greatly enjoys so this longing isn&amp;#8217;t entirely his doing. I suppose we could give him an old original iPhone that&amp;#8217;s laying about but I&amp;#8217;m not comfortable with the amount of time he thinks that the noise of any toy hitting the nearby hard floor is a good thing. Enter the Laugh and Play Apptivity case by Fisher Price. This &amp;#8220;toy&amp;#8221; has caught a lot of flak from parenting groups saying that giving your toddler a $300 iDevice isn&amp;#8217;t a good idea, but let&amp;#8217;s look at it a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-444"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fisher-price-laugh-and-play-apptivity-idevice-case/attachment/assembled/" rel="attachment wp-att-445"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-445" title="assembled" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/assembled-1024x679.jpg" alt="Fisher Price, iPod Touch Case" width="640" height="424" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just bear with me for a few paragraphs before you go all nutty on me and think that this case isn&amp;#8217;t really good fodder for review here at 20SON. Both of your primary hosts here are parents of reasonably young children, and we probably are impressing our nerdiness on them as we go. I suspect the aforementioned lust for the iPhone is related to this impression. The case is well built like nearly everything Fisher Price makes. A soft removable carriage holds whichever iPod Touch or iPhone model you may have. Depending on orientation of the phone in the carriage, the home button is either accessible or blocked until the phone is removed from the case. Since our primary tester isn&amp;#8217;t even two years old, we&amp;#8217;ve chosen to obstruct the home button. The carriage is mounted inside the case proper. A thin plastic conductive sheet protects the device from &amp;#8220;accidental&amp;#8221; milk or juice spills as well as fingers covered with any manner of kid goo. A few chew rings adorn rubberized handles for the device. These handles also serve as additional shock protection in the (likely) event of an airborne case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_446" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-fisher-price-laugh-and-play-apptivity-idevice-case/attachment/takeapart/" rel="attachment wp-att-446"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-446" title="takeapart" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/takeapart-1024x641.jpg" alt="Fisher Price, iPod touch case, iPhone" width="640" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The case disassembled. iPhone or iPod touch not included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, just about every consideration for young people&amp;#8217;s use of an iPod is taken into account, minus a couple. There is no way to charge the device while in the case. Also, the sleep/wake button is completely obscured. A simple hole lined up through the case allowing insertion of the old standby, a straightened paperclip or other such thin spudger would have been great to allow for routine shutdown of the device. The plastic block for the home button is mounted above the protective screen coating. So, in the event of the juice spill we spoke of before, liquid will, and does, get in between the screen coating and the home button blocker. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of plastic between the speaker and the outside of the case, so you really have to jack up the volume. None of these are deal breakers. If you need this case, there is literally no other alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gorilla in the room is the appropriateness of an iPhone like device for a toddler or young child. Whether or not your kid can use and be enriched by an iPhone and the iOS application ecosystem is an exercise for you, the reader. I&amp;#8217;m certainly not suggesting you give your child full unrestricted use of the internet at a tender young age, but I&amp;#8217;m also not going to suggest what that young age might be. This device is the ultimate in ruggedized cases if you choose to allow your child to have supervised access to an iOS device. There are steps you can take to limit your young one&amp;#8217;s use, and with any media or technology, I suggest making a calm and rational decision based on the facts and developmental age of your child. Child specialists (or technology bloggers) have no business making these decisions for you. In any event, the Fisher Price Laugh and Play Apptivity case will protect the device that you insert in it from normal abuse, but will still require you to supervise the user. In our case, it didn&amp;#8217;t completely prevent the tackling that we get when we use an iPhone in the vicinity of our little boy, but it does cut down on it, and just for the cost the case and a first generation iPhone not in use that one of our podcast guests said that all we&amp;#8217;d get for a trade in is a &amp;#8220;nod and hug from a smelly (technology store) employee.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m happy to repurpose this device for the educational needs of my child in conjunction with this case.&lt;/p&gt;

Rocketbirds straps you onto a jet pack, starts up some energizing rock music and let&amp;#8217;s you loose in this 2D flipscreen game. In Rocketbirds, you play Hard Boiled Chicken, a seemingly invincible revolutionary figure, fighting back against the oppressing, Communist Penguin regime. A good looking, though seemingly short game, Rocketbirds is an enjoyable game with a very few downfalls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-429"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_441" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-rocketbirds-hardboiled-chicken/attachment/putzski/" rel="attachment wp-att-441"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-441" title="putzski" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/putzski.jpg" alt="Hardboiled Chicken, Rocketbirds, Putzski" width="600" height="338" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Get Putzski!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you&amp;#8217;ll notice when you begin to play Rocketbirds is its clean animations, overlayed with some trendy rock music. Thanks to it&amp;#8217;s partnership with New World Revolution, a self-proclaimed Science Fiction Rock band, Rocketbirds has a pretty neat soundtrack that fits right in with the game. Rocketbirds uses these scenes between levels to help flesh out some of the backstory of Hard Boiled Chicken&amp;#8217;s and does a good job at it. Despite not having any lines during these parts, the animations were well thought out, and you quickly begin to realize what Hard Boiled has been through. Unfortunately, there are a few scenes of dialogue, which is disappointing because the voice acting, whether intentional or not, is terrible and is a stark contrast to the rest of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gameplay for Rocketbirds is split up into two different parts; travelling on foot and jet packing. For the most part, though, you&amp;#8217;ll be on foot, travelling throughout a few different locales, fighting off the Penguin menace, and solving a few, rather easy puzzles that only seem to serve to break up the pace between combat, not to offer a challenge. You&amp;#8217;ll be required in almost every level to find key cards, which will unlock other doors, to find different colored key cards, which will finally open a door that ends the level. Even with this backtracking gameplay, Rocketbirds just feels short, allowing you to unlock a few different chapters in what seems to be no time at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_442" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-rocketbirds-hardboiled-chicken/attachment/shotgun/" rel="attachment wp-att-442"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-442" title="shotgun" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/shotgun.jpg" alt="Hardboiled Chicken, Rocketbirds, BOOM, Shotgun" width="600" height="338" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;BOOM! Shotgun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat in Rocketbirds may also leave something to be desired. You&amp;#8217;re given a few different weapons, starting out with a pistol and leading up to a machine gun, with which to take out the Penguins and their thugs. This essentially leads to you standing on one side of the screen, shooting across and &amp;#8220;juggling&amp;#8221; one or two baddies with your weapon of choice or running away when you&amp;#8217;re outnumbered. The problem is, if you get shot, you fall over. If you happen to have enemies on both sides of you, you&amp;#8217;ll die quickly in an unstoppable barrage of bullets and the inability to stand for longer than half a second. It does try to introduce a cover system, using darkness to blend in with a wall, and therefore stand on a different plane, which allows you to not be hit by oncoming bullets. This is used sporadically in the first few levels, and a couple levels at the end, leaving you to try and roll your way to one side of the screen, and attempting to juggle every enemy you come across. Near the end of the game, Rocketbirds introduces elite penguins. These penguins are armed with assault rifles, and have the annoying ability to be able to shoot past their comrades, leaving you to quickly take them out, or else die over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also get grenades, though they take so long to aim, that they&amp;#8217;re only useful when the designers decided to place a penguin in the position with the full intent that you use your grenades at this point. A cool mechanic that they added, though, are a type of parasitic bug that you can toss to take control of a bad guy. This allows you to unlock doors or call of elevators that would otherwise be inaccessible to Hard Boiled, but mostly I found myself using it as a tactic to take out the enemies without the threat of losing my own health or ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a couple of the levels, Rocketbirds sends you off, careening around the sky with a large rocket strapped to your back and a sub-machine gun in your hand. For these levels, you have to take out a squadron or two of crafty rocket and helicopter penguins. I took great pleasure in leading their heat seeking rockets right back at them. After defeating your flying adversaries, you&amp;#8217;re tasked with landing on their blimp and sending it crashing down. That will teach the Penguins to use gas inflated blimps with easy to reach self-destruct sequences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocketbirds also comes with a co-op portion of the game, which, much to my dismay, is only playable in the same room. An online co-op, even if it lacked a matchmaking feature, is practically expected in any cooperative game nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one part that Rocketbirds does exceptionally well is the graphics. The 2D game looks painted, but moves just a little bit as you walk across the screen, giving you a cool sense of depth. This, coupled with the sharpness of the musical animations, makes this game look great. All the characters are given their own, unique characteristics, from the tall, proud Cardinals, to the pot bellied Penguins. The art, coupled with the music, creates a fantastic world to play in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocketbirds is a beautiful, though short game. It&amp;#8217;s entertaining for the time that you get with it, but ultimately leaves you wanting a little bit more depth gameplay-wise. The lack of online co-op is a tough pill to swallow. The end of the story leaves it open for sequel, which, if made, will hopefully allow for more refined gameplay. All-in-all, though, Rocketbirds is enjoyable, and certainly beautiful. Try the demo and if you want more, pick up the full game.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>I've found the dichotomy of a finely crafted wood construction to enhance many a technological item including my iPhone. Recently, I contacted Root Cases to inquire about their products after seeing a review of their iPhone case on TUAW. A few days later a Bamboo 15" Macbook Pro case showed up at my door.  </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-15-macbook-pro-root-case/attachment/rootcase-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-509"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-509 aligncenter" title="rootcase-banner" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/rootcase-banner.jpg" alt="Root Case, Macbook Pro, Apple, Wood Case" width="682" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve dabbled with carpentry off and on throughout the years. When I was young, I tried using an omnidirectional handsaw with my Father that we picked up at the &lt;a href="http://www.thebige.com/fair/" target="_blank"&gt;Big E in Western Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; with mixed results. I&amp;#8217;ve assisted in limited furniture making, and done some building framing. I&amp;#8217;m comfortable around woodworking tools of many varieties, while buzzword compliant with the rest of them. Most of my own projects are on the macro side like home improvement, but I do have a genetic knowledge of fine woodworking. I&amp;#8217;ve also found the dichotomy of a finely crafted wood construction to enhance many a technological item &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20-sides-of-nerd-review-iphone-4-jackback-in-mahogany/" target="_blank"&gt;including my iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, I contacted &lt;a href="http://rootcases.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Root Cases&lt;/a&gt; to inquire about their products after seeing a review of their iPhone case on &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/18/root-cases-beautifully-protect-your-apples-and-also-plant-trees/" target="_blank"&gt;TUAW&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later a &lt;a href="http://rootcases.com/catalog/mac-book-pro-cases/bamboo-macbook-pro-case-amber.html" target="_blank"&gt;Bamboo 15&amp;#8243; Macbook Pro case&lt;/a&gt; showed up at my door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-432"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_435" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-15-macbook-pro-root-case/attachment/lid_open/" rel="attachment wp-att-435"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-435" title="lid_open" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/lid_open-1024x746.jpg" alt="Root Case, Wood Mac Book Pro Case" width="640" height="466" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The 15&amp;quot; Mac Book Pro Root Case, lid open. Note the hinge and latching peg and socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, is this thing nicely crafted. It&amp;#8217;s not a clamshell case like I was expecting, but rather a hinged top flap about an inch in length lifts to expose enough Macbook to grab. Metal pegs and sockets keep the case closed. The inside is lightly padded with thin felt. The case appears to have been constructed by gluing thin strips of bamboo wood together, then routing out the interior compartment. Running my fingers over the wood seams reveals no jagged edges, no protrusions anyplace. There just aren&amp;#8217;t any flaws in the finish at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_437" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-15-macbook-pro-root-case/attachment/side_detail/" rel="attachment wp-att-437"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-437" title="side_detail" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/side_detail-1024x721.jpg" alt="Root Case, Mac Book Pro Wood Case" width="640" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;No flaws in construction at all. Amazing quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Root Case is more of a sleeve than an actual case. The design and size of the case don&amp;#8217;t allow for a &lt;a href="https://www.speckproducts.com/macbook-cases/macbook-pro.html"&gt;Speck skin&lt;/a&gt; to be installed on the Macbook. There is no room for a &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC556LL/B?fnode=MTY1NDA2Nw"&gt;magsafe adapter&lt;/a&gt;, nor any door to thread a charging cable through either. The top hatch where the Macbook enters and exits the case isn&amp;#8217;t quite large enough to allow the Macbook to be inserted fully and still charge. This isn&amp;#8217;t really the intention of this case, though. There is some impact resistance from the felt, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m going to be drop testing the case to see how well it protects. I&amp;#8217;m confident that minor impacts will be fine, but anything major will be a problem. The felt exists more to protect the aluminum case of the Macbook from being scratched than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Root Case is more of a style statement than anything else. It excels at what it does. If you need the style and impact resistance, use it like a sleeve in a backpack rather than a true case on it&amp;#8217;s own. If you are going to go this route with an additional bag, realize that the case adds about an inch to the width and height of the case (about a half an inch in thickness), so a bag that accommodates a 17&amp;#8243; laptop is probably your best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any other &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; product there are more choices in cases and protective gear than you get with initial configuration of your device in the first place. I do admit, I&amp;#8217;m a sucker for a finely crafted wood product like this. At $100, it&amp;#8217;s not cheap. There are many cases that cost more and either don&amp;#8217;t look as nice or don&amp;#8217;t provide any protection to speak of at all. The Root Case is both stylistic and provides some protection. I recommend it if you need both, or even just style by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case provided for review by company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some factual issues popped up, but I blame it on varied professions your hosts have occupied over the years. It is hardly surprising given the fact that childhood and working tend to co-mingle in one of our host&amp;#8217;s mind. Be thankful the only confusion rambled was about 16-bit video game dates. Join Draeno and Emdee with their guests Das Kalk and El Pollo Guapo while we chew through the gristle that was the news this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Nintendo&amp;#8217;s billion dollar loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; SOE, why did &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Galaxies&lt;/em&gt; ship with no space combat?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Draeno schools Emdee on how MMOs make money.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;

It is hard for me to imagine just what might happen if the Earth was ever invaded by another species. Between the fact that humans seem to be a war torn race capable of doing all the wrong things and our susceptibility to fear, it isn’t a far reach to see how bad it could be. With all the forms of fiction we’ve created about the experience, easily you can understand why this might be a problem. I’d like to think that the father of science fiction, H.G. Wells gave us one of the truest possibilities back in 1898, with &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. If you aren’t familiar with the classic H.G. Wells novel, you should go to your local library, online retailer of choice or your &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36" target="_blank"&gt;favorite e-book vendor&lt;/a&gt; and read it. Don’t worry, it’ll take you less time to read than you’d spend playing the game. In order to garner a full understanding of the situation you are being thrown into in &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, you need to understand what happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-419"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can’t start to talk about &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; without first talking about the story. In fact, why didn’t this game come with a copy? Here’s the quick notes. Meteors fall from the sky in Victorian-era London. Martians appear from what we thought were falling rocks to start decimating the planet. Humanity goes into a panic as we are being wiped out at every turn. Hope turns into a guiding light for those with something to fight for. As Martians feed on humanity, we fight, hide and scamper for a chance to survive. Rather than try to try to replicate what has already been done via print and radio, &lt;a href="http://www.otherocean.com/"&gt;Other Ocean Interactive&lt;/a&gt; took a different approach. The protagonist, Arthur, told his own tale. Literally, his journal was narrated in character by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001772/"&gt;Sir Patrick Stewart&lt;/a&gt; himself. The good thing, it didn’t step on the Wells’ toes- it merely just lived in his world. The modern film equivalent would to be &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/em&gt; without the vomit inducing shaky cam. You see what Arthur sees. The player guides him through his 2D, on the edge platforming experience, one terrifying step at a time. This experience plays right to the heart of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_422" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-war-of-the-worlds-xbla/attachment/war-of-the-worlds-fear-timing/" rel="attachment wp-att-422"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/War-of-the-Worlds-Fear-Timing.jpg" alt="War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells, Other Ocean Interactive, Martians, invasion, 2D, platform, rotoscope, frustration, controller smashing, rotoscoping, atmosphere, story telling" title="War of the Worlds Fear Timing" width="450" height="253" class="size-full wp-image-422" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Even just mistiming your step or pausing for just a split second will punish you in War of the Worlds. Even one touch from their heat rays will lay Arthur to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s set everything straight. &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; is a unforgiving game in difficulty. Within an hour it had me howling at the television insisting all sorts of things were wrong and how much bull***t the game was feeding me. I was loathing every death more and more as I played on. The tolerance room for error when it comes to movement and puzzles is well beyond what one would expect. Literally, there is next to no allowance. Your timing needs to be flawless within milliseconds. Once you get a look at the achievements, it comes together. I’ll leave you to discover them, but here’s one solid reason why you get that message. In one of the loading screens it states that only 1 in every 163,000 people will get all of the achievements associated with the game. It only takes a few hours of playing it to realize just how true that statement rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a good night&amp;#8217;s sleep, I actually came to a better understanding of what was trying to be accomplished with &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Waking up in the morning I started to process more of the experience. The lighting strike of inspiration hit me in the shower, of all places. There should have been an achievement for beating &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; in one sitting without taking a bat to your television. Well, once the crappy first caffeine free realization was out of the way the real picture emerged. You are rooting for Arthur and, in turn, humanity. It is through hardship and tenacity that the human race would survive this war from beyond. Those who chose to fight, not just the aliens, but the world crumbling around them would be the ones to live. This element is translated through the pain &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; delivers through your emotions. It digs at our core instincts to survive. It makes us push on through the mind melting frustration to ensure that the sprinkling of hope wasn’t false. We want there to be a light at the end of the tunnel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build and release of events provides just enough to push you down, but bring you right back up again with little victories. Having a powerful voice like Sir Patrick Stewart lending his voice to the story only adds to the intensity. The music hits peaks and lulls in ideal places to add that adjustment that one would expect as the need for adrenaline hits or fades. While the game is short, if you doubled the length or halved the difficultly, you wouldn’t feel these emotions with as much intensity. And the difficulty is far, far away from what one would be used to in a platformer. Without it though, the heart wrenching agony that the game needs to drive it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be there. Such thoughtful design went into this title all the way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_423" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-war-of-the-worlds-xbla/attachment/war-of-the-worlds-will/" rel="attachment wp-att-423"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/War-of-the-Worlds-Will.jpg" alt="War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells, Other Ocean Interactive, Martians, invasion, 2D, platform, rotoscope, frustration, controller smashing, rotoscoping, atmosphere, story telling" title="War of the Worlds Will" width="450" height="253" class="size-full wp-image-423" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jumping from roof to roof to survive is just a prime example of how the game inspires you to push on. You want Arthur to succeed so badly, that you push on through the frustration to see him survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually War of the Worlds is an amazing feat. I know that people judge Live Arcade titles in a different light, but really to do so to this game is unfair. It isn’t a throw every bit of graphics and computing power at it to pump through the frame rates. As an inquisitive puzzle adventure it needs to fulfill certain ambiance in order to pull off the whole package. It far and away blows away the tiny expectations most people would have for an indie title. Rotoscoping was by far the way to go for the characters. As you begin to throw herds of them together they smoothly bend together in the madness. It also helps provide contrast between the environment as well as your Martian invaders. When you start to add on the layers of 2D things going on, it really sticks you into the atmosphere. You have multiple levels of action playing from the foreground to background that create an engrossing experience. It just adds another level of feel to the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically great, doesn’t mean that everything is all fine and dandy though. Controlling Arthur feels a bit clumsy. With the simple, class 2D approach it feels like the controls are straight out of the Nintendo-era. They seem slow to respond, especially when it comes to attempting to start movement towards a timed element. It is almost as if they lag a little bit. This can be overcome, but because of the placement of some 2D elements and camera shifts it compounds the issue. Lighting flashes and foreground elements due to these movements, will often give you problems with puzzles. The shifts are done with purpose, but the speed of them isn’t the best. You notice this a lot when dropping from heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_424" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-war-of-the-worlds-xbla/attachment/war-of-the-worlds-environment/" rel="attachment wp-att-424"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/War-of-the-Worlds-Environment.jpg" alt="War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells, Other Ocean Interactive, Martians, invasion, 2D, platform, rotoscope, frustration, controller smashing, rotoscoping, atmosphere, story telling" title="War of the Worlds Environment" width="450" height="253" class="size-full wp-image-424" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The environment in War of the Worlds just adds to your appreciation of the game. However, those pretty things can cause a lot of headaches when trying to navigate through puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;, you rage inducing, dark little, side scrolling platformer. You pull at me emotionally with your alternate view to the story in the H.G. Wells penned Martian attack. Yet, I can’t feel more than a sigh upon beating it. If it is a sigh of relief or a sigh of happiness, I can’t fully tell. The insane tolerance threshold you have to operate in left me with frustration levels so high, it had me walking away from the game for fear of embedding my controller in the wall more than once. In the end though, it provided one hell of a challenge. Even while it was short, the difficulty had purpose to the scale. I felt like I was left with a genuine sense of accomplishment when I beat it. Rolling in at a low 800 point cost, you can’t help but second guess the title a little. It makes it hard to know what to think about it. When you let everything soak in, you’ll know that for such a low price it is a must play. If the possibility of frustration scares you from this title, stay away. &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; will put you in a fit of rage. However, the rage is what makes you appreciate the game. A weird balance, but it wouldn’t be the experience it is without it.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>War is a pretty ubiquitous topic when it comes to video games. Rarely, however do games incorporate it in a way that doesn’t involve some more mature subject matter. The Toy Soldiers series is the exception to that rule, it seems, and Toy Soldiers: Cold War, as part of this summer’s Summer of Arcade promotion, aims to iterate once more on the strategy-shooter mashup formula that made the first Toy Soldiers such a success.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=415" rel="attachment wp-att-415"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Intro-Image.jpg" alt="Cold War, Toy Soldiers" title="Intro Image" width="682" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-415" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War is a pretty ubiquitous topic when it comes to video games. Rarely, however do games incorporate it in a way that doesn’t involve some more mature subject matter. The &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; series is the exception to that rule, it seems, and &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, as part of this summer’s Summer of Arcade promotion, aims to iterate once more on the strategy-shooter mash-up formula that made the first &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; such a success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-410"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_411" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-toy-soldiers-cold-war/attachment/image-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-411"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Image-1.jpg" alt="Toy Solders, Cold War, Period Piece, Keytar" title="Cold War Miniatures Set" width="498" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-411" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The keytar really sells it. Toy Soldiers is a period piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nearly no story to speak of in &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers&lt;/em&gt;, and that’s actually a good thing. The lack of any narrative lends itself to the idea of a toy box. Because you’re not told why everything is happening, you can put yourself in the shoes of a kid playing with the soldiers in his toy box. This is perhaps the game’s greatest strength, recreating the feeling you had as a kid on a Sunday afternoon, playing with your toys. Sadly, the historical context of the game defused this nostalgia for me to a small degree – simply because I grew up in the 90’s, so much of the humor derived from American patriotic stereotypes from the 80’s was lost on me (perhaps also because I’m Canadian). To be sure, this is a microscopic gripe with the game, and perhaps a selling point for those of you who do have those particular memories. Nostalgia is a powerful marketing tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; earns its stripes is most certainly in gameplay, offering a satisfying mix of both shooting and real-time-strategy elements. Each match is broken down into waves of enemies who spawn at pre-determined intervals. You can allow waves to arrive early for bonus points.  Also, killing multiple enemies in quick succession will grant you point multipliers and potentially a bonus power. These powers range from a Rambo-esque howling commando, to an AC-130 gunship, to an artillery barrage. They’re useful in the thick of things, and immensely rewarding when you manage to take out a batch of infantry as the points roll in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_412" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-toy-soldiers-cold-war/attachment/image-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-412"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Image-2.jpg" alt="Rambo, Cold War, Toy Soldiers" title="Rambo" width="498" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-412" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rambo-clone will run around the battlefield screaming like a maniac when you call him in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how to get these perks in the first place, you ask? Well, each map has a number of plots on it. These plots – either large or small in size – house your units. The game’s perspective is one typical of real-time strategy games, with a reticule in the center of the screen on the ground. When you move over a plot, you can select a unit type to place there, and subsequently repair, upgrade, sell (to open the plot up to a different unit type), or control the unit. Controlling each unit type adds another layer of fun to the game, with each one having strengths and weaknesses. These strengths and weaknesses as singular units also enhance the strategy elements of the game, forcing you to constantly re-assess what units you’re going to need, and where you’re going to want to put them. In addition to these units, most maps also have battery-operated toys on the map. These are toys that can only be used for a certain amount of time, since their batteries will run out (though you can collect batteries on the map to extend your time), but they are mobile, and generally much more powerful than your standard units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_413" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-toy-soldiers-cold-war/attachment/image-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-413"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Image-3.jpg" alt="Cold War, Toy Soldiers, Helicopter Attack" title="Aerial Strike" width="498" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-413" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;More mobile units such as tanks or helicopters can be devastating, but their availability is limited, and should be used strategically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game allows you to play it strictly as a strategy game, or toss in more action elements if you choose, and these additional options mean that if you’re going to best your friends on the leaderboards you’ll have to be savvy about how you play. The options granted to you instill a sense of choice that many games struggle to achieve. You never feel as though you have no recourse, since one of your options is always available to you. That’s not to say the game isn’t difficult, because it definitely can be. You’re not penalized for losing units beyond having to buy a new one, but if any enemy units reach your toy box (usually located behind your plots), they will knock some health off depending on their unit type. This isn’t a problem on earlier levels, but once the waves start consisting of close to a hundred attack choppers, things get, well, choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_414" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/guest-review-toy-soldiers-cold-war/attachment/image-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-414"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Image-4.jpg" alt="Incoming, Toy Solders, Cold War" title="Incoming!" width="498" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-414" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hordes of choppers will descend upon you – be sure to have at least one anti-aircraft turret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers: Cold Wars&lt;/em&gt; weaknesses are few and far between. Nothing comes to mind when I ask myself what I don’t like about the game. I have a few minor gripes with the controls of the jet (one of the battery-operated vehicles in the game), and the historical context can potentially alienate some, but these pale in comparison to the all-out fun that the rest of the game offers. It’s not the longest XBLA game out there, but the replay value it offers in the scoring system as well as a handful of mini-games is enough to keep you periodically booting it up for some solid action-strategy any day of the week. For those looking to enjoy solid strategy elements mixed with fun action-shooter influences, with pangs of nostalgia, &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers: Cold War&lt;/em&gt; is certainly worth your time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Das Kalk&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/the-punisher-picked-up-by-fox/attachment/the-punisher-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-407"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/the-punisher-banner.jpg" alt="The Punisher, Frank Castle, comic, television, Marvel, Fox, The Spectre, DC Comics, Human Target, Vertigo, pilot, Ed Bernero" title="the-punisher-banner" width="682" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a move that perhaps perplexes fans of &lt;a href="http://www.marvel.com"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; comics, &lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; has decided to buy an hour long drama based on the character of Frank Castle, better known as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher"&gt;The Punisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Developed by &lt;a href="http://abc.go.com/"&gt;ABC Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; will be the fifth live-action television show produced by the studio. &lt;em&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cloak &amp;amp; Dagger&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;AKA Jessica Jones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; being the other four. However, this is the first to be sold outside of the ABC family. The pilot, which has been given a commitment to film, puts a different spin on Marvel’s most well-known vigilante. Castle be a detective that rises through the ranks of the New York Police Department during the day, but the justly corrective force known as &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; by night. It will be built as a police procedural style show, brought to us by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0076708/"&gt;Ed Bernero&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it even more troubling is that it was Fox that picked it up. As a viewer, it is going to be awkward seeing two shows from opposing comic titans on the same channel. While not a big deal, I can easily see Fox dumping &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_%28comics%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spectre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or vice versa. Let us not forget, that only in the last season Fox dumped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Target_%28Vertigo%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Target&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.dccomics.com/vertigo/"&gt;Vertigo&lt;/a&gt; adaptation, that had been heavily modified from the original premise. Low ratings lead them to do a reboot of the show for the second season even. How they could get rid of a show as entertaining as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439741/"&gt;Human Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; though, boggles my mind. Especially when you have a fantastic actor like &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355097/"&gt;Jackie Earle Haley&lt;/a&gt; playing such an interesting role. I digress, but given the track record with Fox and anything resembling genre television can you blame me? We’ll just have to cross our fingers and hope Frank Castle has as much vengeance as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/batmans-nemesis-loses-his-voice-mark-hamill-joker-no-more/attachment/hamill-joker-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-404"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/hamill-joker-banner.jpg" alt="Mark Hamill, The Joker, Batman: Arkham City, Brent Spiner, Joe Di Maggio, cartoon, movies, comics, DC Comics, voice acting" title="hamill-joker-banner" width="682" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000434/"&gt;Mark Hamill&lt;/a&gt; announced that he would be handing up the reigns of Batman’s twisted, oft comedic nemesis &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28comics%29"&gt;The Joker&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1992 with the introduction of the highly popular &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;, Hamill has been voicing the Ace of Knaves over multiple cartoons, television series, and video games. After doing the voice work for &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, Hamill told &lt;a href="http://ps3.ign.com/articles/109/1092968p1.html"&gt;IGN in May 2010&lt;/a&gt; that he would be returning for the sequel, Arkham City. However, he would be hanging up the reigns afterwards. Sadly, this week Mr. Hamill confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Batman: AC&lt;/em&gt; would indeed be his last time boarding the crazy train for this iconic villain over Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/batmans-nemesis-loses-his-voice-mark-hamill-joker-no-more/attachment/hamill-tweet/" rel="attachment wp-att-405"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/hamill-tweet.jpg" alt="Mark Hamill, The Joker, Batman: Arkham City, Brent Spiner, Joe Di Maggio, cartoon, movies, comics, DC Comics, voice acting" title="hamill-tweet" width="540" height="111" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a definite sadness to lose such a prolific voice actor for Gotham City, what could this mean for the future of The Joker? Will we see &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0224007/"&gt;John Di Maggio&lt;/a&gt; return the role he played in &lt;em&gt;Batman: Under the Red Hood&lt;/em&gt;? Could it be &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000653/"&gt;Brent Spiner&lt;/a&gt; who voiced the Harlequin of Hate in the latest cartoon iteration of the Justice League- &lt;em&gt;Young Justice&lt;/em&gt;? Will DC Comics decide to bring back any of the seven other voice actors to assume the role in the last ten years? Or will we have a chance to see someone else chime in with their own brand of madness? We’ll just have to wait to find out. With a game that is garnering rave reviews, the DC reboot, and the overall popularity of all things Batman, I’m sure we won’t be waiting that long. All I know is, the poor sap they choose will have some massive, well-worn wingtips to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Been drooling over the PS Vita? Is the anticipation of being able to caress the device in your hands already causing your palms to get sweaty? Or maybe you’ve been searching for things to sell on Ebay to be able to get one shipped from Japan early? Well hold on to your action figure collection because the release date for North America, Europe, and Latin American has been announced. We’ll be seeing the PS Vita hit the shelves on February 22, 2012. Only two months after hitting the market in Japan!</description>

&lt;p&gt;Been drooling over the PS Vita? Is the anticipation of being able to caress the device in your hands already causing your palms to get sweaty? Or maybe you’ve been searching for things to sell on Ebay to be able to get one shipped from Japan early? Well hold on to your action figure collection because the release date for North America, Europe, and Latin American has been announced. We’ll be seeing the PS Vita hit the shelves on February 22, 2012. Only two months after hitting the market in Japan!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-397"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Setting up to have an impressive launch, there are already 100 titles in development with 26 said to be released at launch. Not interested in any of the titles that will be out? Well the Vita will include its own social app to connect with other Vita owners, as well as apps for the most popular social applications. I can’t wait to see “tweeted by PS Vita” myself. In addition, the new handheld will offer backwards compatibility to PSP download titles, and allow other game and media downloads from the PlayStation Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for pre-orders soon! Let’s hope those $249 (Wi-Fi) and $299 (Wi-Fi &amp;#038; 3G) don’t scare people off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the blog release information below!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon on stage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, I shared some very exciting news that I know the PlayStation Nation has been anticipating since we unveiled PlayStation Vita back in January. For those looking to get their hands on the ultimate in handheld entertainment, I’m thrilled to let you know that starting on February 22, 2012, PS Vita will be available at major retailers in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first-party studios and army of publishing partners have been extremely hard at work to ensure that PS Vita launches with a vast library of titles that deliver unique gameplay experiences that go beyond any handheld or mobile device on the market. We have more than 100 games currently in development globally that span many different genres, including Sound Shapes, Resistance: Burning Skies, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Capcom’s Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed, EA Sports’ FIFA, Activision’s Call of Duty, and numerous others that you’ll hear about in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the chance to spend some time with several of these titles and I think you’ll be blown away by how each takes advantage of the technology packed into PS Vita to deliver amazing gaming experiences. With its vibrant 5-inch OLED screen, dual analog sticks, dual cameras, and front and rear touch panel, PS Vita will deliver rich, immersive games with stunning graphics, which simply can’t be found anywhere else. Now you’ll be able to play shooters and action titles on-the-go with controls that are familiar, and you won’t have to block out the gorgeous screen to interact with the games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the deep portfolio of games, you’ll also have access to native social applications – near and Party – that help you connect with your friends and fellow PS Vita owners. We also recently announced that PS Vita will have your favorite social networking applications like Facebook, foursquare, Skype, and Twitter, so you can share and connect with friends. With PS Vita, you can enjoy the best handheld gaming experience available and stay connected to the people and interests you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s never been a better time to be a part of PlayStation Nation and I can’t wait for you to experience this revolutionary handheld system. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we near the February 22, 2012 launch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                    <description>Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.hirezstudios.com/"&gt;Hi-Rez Studios&lt;/a&gt; announced that closed beta for their upcoming title &lt;em&gt;Tribes: Ascend&lt;/em&gt; will be beginning on November 4, 2011.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/tribes-ascend-closed-beta-starts-114/attachment/tribes-ascend-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-395"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Tribes-Ascend-Banner.jpg" alt="Tribes: Ascend, Tribes: Vengence, Tribes, Hi-Rez Studios, Global Agenda, beta, shooter, fps, skiing, jetpacks, news" title="Tribes-Ascend-Banner" width="700" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.hirezstudios.com/"&gt;Hi-Rez Studios&lt;/a&gt; announced that closed beta for their upcoming title &lt;em&gt;Tribes: Ascend&lt;/em&gt; will be beginning on November 4, 2011. The beta will be by invitation only, so it is probably wise to start looking into registering if you want to get in on it. According to their press release, the beta will only be covering a small portion of the content for the free to play game. This is to be expected, but shouldn’t be a reason to deter one from trying. Old fans still wanting a better title after the &lt;em&gt;Tribes: Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; disaster, and new ones coming aboard from Hi-Rez’s &lt;em&gt;Global Agenda&lt;/em&gt; should provide some competition. Given the buzz that has been surrounding the game since PAX, it may be one worth taking an early look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a special bonus, Hi-Rez is offering a guaranteed spot for those dedicated Tribes fans who purchase the VIP Starter Bundle. In said bundle you get VIP status (whatever that is), a 30 day booster, and 800 of their in game currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit their &lt;a href="http://tribesascend.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the bundle or chance being selected via the open registration.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>There are a few options for handheld emulation.  Some easy, some not.  Where does the GP2X Caanoo unit range on this scale?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-gp2x-caanoo-handheld/attachment/caanootitle/" rel="attachment wp-att-392"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/caanootitle.jpg" alt="Caanoo, Super Mario 3, Emulation, MAME, SNES" title="The Caanoo" width="600" height="456" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a child desperate for his arcade fix, I&amp;#8217;d find games in the unlikeliest of spots.  The bowling alley had a cigarette-charred Space Invaders and Pac Mac machine.  The local mall sported an arcade in the Dream Machine chain.  Sure, I had a home computer earlier than most, had a buddy that owned an Atari, and a second friend had a ColecoVision, but the only place to get some of the pure arcade experiences was actually at the arcade.  There was nothing quite like dedicated hardware for each game.  At the time, input devices for computers and consoles were either too low fidelity like the Atari joystick, complicated pads with required cardboard inserts or  very precise almost scientific in quality (and price!) analog joysticks like most for Apple II computers.  Consoles and portables have gotten loads better at the arcade experience.  In may cases arcade-perfect versions of games are available from their original manufacturer.  A few custom devices exist to facilitate this now- one of them is the latest in the GP2X line, the Caanoo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-382"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The unit is comfortable when held and in use, and feels solid in the hand.  If you&amp;#8217;ve used a Playstation Portable, you&amp;#8217;ve got a pretty good idea of how the device is laid out.  A diamond shaped ABXY button panel, left and right shoulder buttons.  A d-pad in previous incarnations of the GP2X has been removed in favor of a surface mounted analog stick with integral button.  There are two buttons underneath the analog stick normally used for emulation when the unit is turned 90°.  For storage, the Caanoo uses a SD card up to 32 gigabytes.   A single port is used to charging and for data transfer.  I think the port is a cellphone standard, but I&amp;#8217;m not positive.   I&amp;#8217;ve never owned a phone that has used this connector.  A female USB 1.1 port is used for installation of a 802.11g/n wireless dongle, if need be.  The unit sports a 533 mhz processor.  Technically, the screen is a bright and clear 3.5 inch 320&amp;#215;240 resistive touch screen, but it&amp;#8217;s only charitably described as such- the sensitivity on the screen is very, very bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_393" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-gp2x-caanoo-handheld/attachment/caanoovsothers/" rel="attachment wp-att-393"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/caanoovsothers.jpg" alt="Caanoo, iPhone, DS Phat, Size, GP2X" title="Caanoo Versus iPhone and DS Phat" width="800" height="675" class="size-full wp-image-393" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caanoo bottom right, smaller than the DS Phat, bigger than an iPhone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Caanoo is a device that does technically have other uses than piracy, which brings us to the primary issue with the device.  Let&amp;#8217;s be frank here- the device&amp;#8217;s primary use is retro emulators.  There is a Caanoo store, but the games and applications in the store aren&amp;#8217;t fantastic, nor any reason to buy the device.  In order to utilize the device to it&amp;#8217;s fullest extent, you must be both technically savvy and comfortable with hunting down ROM files for the console or arcade ports you&amp;#8217;re looking to play.  This device isn&amp;#8217;t Atari&amp;#8217;s Greatest Hits on CD.  To find these ROMs you&amp;#8217;ll be digging though the underbelly of the internet looking for this site or that, which may or may not yield anything that works.  If this is something that makes you uncomfortable, then this device is not for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Caanoo uses a custom Linux build for a basic OS.  This allows for easy and quick porting of many emulators, and other games like Quake to the Caanoo.  Installation is as simple as downloading the application to your computer, and copying the application folder and .ini file to the CF card.  I installed SNES, NES, and Genesis emulators, as well as a Caanoo specific version of Quake.  All have many configuration options, sometimes as fine as individual settings for specific games.  In my trials, I found the SNES and Genesis emulation to be the smoothest.  After I dug out my over a decade old Quake CD, extracted the PAK files, and tweaked the configuration file a bit, Quake was buttery smooth.  For whatever the reason, the NES emulation, while faithful, was a bit stuttery and slower than the original hardware it&amp;#8217;s based on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I like the Caanoo.  It&amp;#8217;s a small unit, I don&amp;#8217;t have to deal with the strangeness associated with hacking/cracking a PSP.   There is a technical barrier to entry, and it&amp;#8217;s all about being comfortable with finding and using the ROM files.  It&amp;#8217;s a simple choice- you&amp;#8217;re either comfortable downloading them from usenet or a torrent site or you&amp;#8217;re not.  If you are, and are looking for a unit to play them on, this beats those $10 at Walmart devices you plug into the television.  If you&amp;#8217;re not, then it&amp;#8217;s probably best to stick with the reimaginings or the disks of classic games for modern consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>A new event has come to &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion’s&lt;/a&gt; MMO &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.riftgame.com"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Ashes of History sets the Ascended (players) in a race to collect Magma Opals through daily quests, rifts, and invasion events to fight off the Golden Maw and the Wanton. The stones are needed to repair traveling stones to be able to head them off on their turf. To coincide with the new event, &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion&lt;/a&gt; decided to launch a new special edition upgrade for sale.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=390"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Rift-Banner.jpg" alt="Rift, Trion, ascended, MMO, defiant, guardian, invasions, rifts, pvp" title="Rift-Banner" width="700" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new event has come to &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion’s&lt;/a&gt; MMO &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.riftgame.com"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Ashes of History sets the Ascended (players) in a race to collect Magma Opals through daily quests, rifts, and invasion events to fight off the Golden Maw and the Wanton. The stones are needed to repair traveling stones to be able to head them off on their turf. To coincide with the new event, &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion&lt;/a&gt; decided to launch a new special edition upgrade for sale. Included in the pack is a new Spindrel (spider) mount, a banker than you can summon, and a new shiny tabard for your characters. The cost to you? &lt;a href="https://www.riftgame.com/en/products/upgrade.php"&gt;Only $10 dollars.&lt;/a&gt; This isn’t unheard of from &lt;a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/en/"&gt;Trion&lt;/a&gt;, as they still sell the Collector’s Edition upgrade from the original launch for the players that didn’t catch it the first go round. If you are in the dark about that pack, you got a Tartagon (two headed turtle) mount, a larger bag for carrying loot and a special Bogling pet. I’m starting to notice a trend here. Don’t want to pay for digital items? New gear and augments drop as well. Even a new pet and Ash Strider (raptor) mount were added!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new event was supposed to kick off on &lt;a href="http://community.riftgame.com/en/2011/10/11/ashes-of-history-world-event-starts-wednesday-912/"&gt;10/12&lt;/a&gt;, but was delayed to 10/13 “due to concerns over possible performance issues that arose during the opening in EU.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s hope that &lt;em&gt;Rift&lt;/em&gt; isn’t getting a taste of what &lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started doing. Though, for $10 you get way more than you would if you bought in-game items from &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. If it puts Rift in a better place to topple the king, I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t have Rift yet? Don’t worry you still have through 10/19 to pick it up on massive sale. &lt;a href="https://www.riftgame.com/en/products/trial-upgrade.php"&gt;For $5, you can’t go wrong.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Source &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://www.riftgame.com/en/game/updates/ashes-history-events.php"&gt;Rift website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-387"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Banner.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Banner" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-387" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Real time strategy metaphor and history? Written and discarded. Tower defense game summary? Been there, done that. Game hybridization lecture? No point. I&amp;#8217;ve probably written and deleted more paragraphs for the beginning of this review than any other review I&amp;#8217;ve ever written. After many launch delays, promises to players, and shipping date slips, &lt;a href="http://dungeondefenders.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; by Trendy Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; hits the Playstation Network on October 18th, followed by xBox Live and Steam on October 19th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-374"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Setting and overall scenario is nothing new. Four medieval-adjacent heroes vanquish an ancient eldritch evil, but can&amp;#8217;t destroy it. Complacency sets in, the heroes depart leaving their progeny behind to defend the stronghold. Things go terribly wrong, leaving the unlikely heroes to step up to save all of creation. Nothing new, but &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; executes it fairly well in the intro video. Character design trends toward cell-shaded chibi archetypes of a Monk, a He-Man Orko-like Mage, a saucy thief-type Huntress, and a well-armored fighter called the Squire. If this seems a little sparse to begin with, more classes are promised in the future as DLC. At press time, the results of a community poll point towards the release of a summoner class, but this wasn&amp;#8217;t available at time of review.  Class selection determines the basic degree of difficulty, but this is pointed out at time of selection. No nasty surprises there. A first level squire is no different than any other first level squire- the only differentiation comes as you play the game, equip yourself, and level up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_386" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-place-tower/" rel="attachment wp-att-386"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Place-Tower.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Place Tower" width="512" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-386" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plotting your towers is quite an easy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is a must-play. In it you get a feel for the game&amp;#8217;s progression, and the layout of the first level the game is played on. This includes how many bad guys are coming, and which entry they are  going to come from.  Your goal is to protect your Eternia Crystal from enemy assault. Prior to this assault, every combat turn begins with a setup round allowing you as much time as you want to complete your defenses. Time allowed for defense configuration is configurable to a set amount of time if desired. When you&amp;#8217;ve got your defenses set up as best as you can with the resources and towers you have at your disposal, you touch the Eternia Crystal. Afterwards, it&amp;#8217;s time to fight off the masses of evil. I didn&amp;#8217;t care for the default camera angle while I was setting up my defenses as I didn&amp;#8217;t feel like it gave me a good local picture. The camera angle is a minor complaint, though. As is the case with most of the hybrid shooter/tower defense games, you don&amp;#8217;t have enough towers initially to defend your objective with just static defenses. Of course, that leaves you to just wade in and get your hands dirty. This balance of not enough resources changes as the level progresses to a state where you can&amp;#8217;t defend the crystal without adequate defenses, so a good plan going into the level is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_385" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-itembox/" rel="attachment wp-att-385"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Itembox.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Itembox" width="512" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-385" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As you can see the item box provides a simple display where to keep the items you&amp;#039;ve upgraded over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting gameplay mechanic is the forge. It is the centerpiece of the customization of the game. At the forge, accessible during the setup phase, you can swap in and out your characters. Do you like the Huntress&amp;#8217; towers but prefer your Squire for the face smashing? Fine. Start with the Huntress and set up your defenses. You can then return to the forge and swap out for the Squire. If you find a particularly nice piece of weaponry that you want to keep around, you can invest mana in the Forge to enhance it&amp;#8217;s abilities. If you max out an item, it&amp;#8217;ll be forever branded with your user name to tell the world no matter who ends up with it who the original forger of the item is. The developers see this as an opportunity for individual forgers to be known for their items. How well this feature pans out remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_384" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-incoming/" rel="attachment wp-att-384"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Incoming.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Incoming" width="512" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-384" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The group gets ready to take on all comers as the fight begins anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most reviews, I initially wade into the game in single player mode. I rapidly learned that this game isn&amp;#8217;t an ideal single player experience. The scaling of the level difficulty and the near impossible tasks to juggle with one player made it glaringly obvious that this game is intended for co-op play over the long run. In this day of ubiquitous internet connections, the Playstation Network, xBox Live and Steam, there shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a big problem with that for any gamer. The lack of an experience optimized for single player is just something you need to be aware of before purchase. Split-screen co-op is possible, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen a video of it on the PC version. I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to test this functionality on the xBox in time for this review. I did have the opportunity to play multiplayer on xBox Live, and it was very smooth with no synchronization issues or other network related problems. On the xBox, there&amp;#8217;s no good trade mechanism for gear or forged items other than the old school &amp;#8220;dropping it on the ground&amp;#8221; method. I have been informed that a secure trading mechanism will be implemented in a patch as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_383" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-chaos-of-battle/" rel="attachment wp-att-383"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Chaos-of-Battle.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Chaos of Battle" width="512" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-383" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Spell effects and text flies as spells and defensive hurl all their might at the oncoming mobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; is the first tower defense game to integrate a roleplaying game class level progression. As enemies are slaughtered, you gain experience. After X amount of points are accumulated, your character levels up allowing you to purchase additional skills. These skills are either personal buffs like character speed or rate of fire, or enhancements to your defense towers you place. Other skills are unlocked as you go, either as a direct relation to your character class, or as a side effect of other stats increasing. For instance, you can&amp;#8217;t upgrade towers until your maximum accumulated mana skill is greater than 100. Pets are unlocked at level 6.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in addition to gear you find, trade for, or buy, there are pets. These are purchasable at the tavern- the gathering place between levels. Pets provide stat boost to your character, enhance your defenses, and even lay the hurt down on the enemies trying to break your crystals.  Pro tip- you can buy or lock down a pet before you&amp;#8217;re able to use it. Items in the tavern store are randomized every visit, so it is possible to see a pet that fits the vision of your character. Not high enough level to use it? You can lock it in the store, preventing the loss of it to the gods of randomness. Of course, you still have to purchase it at some point, probably after level 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_388" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-dungeon-defenders-for-xbox-live/attachment/dungeon-defenders-cloaked-huntress/" rel="attachment wp-att-388"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Dungeon-Defenders-Cloaked-Huntress.jpg" alt="Dungeon Defenders, Trendy Entertainment, Squire, Huntress, Eternia Crystal, Forge, co-op, Mage, Monk, tower defense, hybrid, RPG, customization, xBox Live, Steam, Playstation Network, xBox Live Arcade" title="Dungeon Defenders Cloaked Huntress" width="512" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-388" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Use special abilities such as the Huntress&amp;#039; Invisibility to aid your battle strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; is a mix of game styles and gameplay mechanisms.  Defenses trend more towards shooters of varying varieties, rather than launchers and physics based traps like &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of the chibi-cute graphical style of the player characters, the game takes itself and it&amp;#8217;s tweakiness very seriously.  Gear and player enhancements feel very much like old-school &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; in it&amp;#8217;s statistical finickiness and customizability. I&amp;#8217;m concerned that people don&amp;#8217;t associate deep gameplay on the xBox with titles purchased on the xBox Live arcade service. I am primarily a console gamer, more for convenience than any other reason. I think that &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; will find life and a persistent home on Steam rather than on xBox Live just given the nature of Steam and xBox Live gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did have a lot of fun with &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt;. However, this fun didn&amp;#8217;t really kick in until I found a couple of other reviewers throwing themselves into the game. Before I started with two other players, some stages of the game felt very much like work. If loot tweaking, character build modification or gear customization are unwelcome added layers of complexity, pick up the faster and less serious &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; and skip &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, if you both have a posse of players you can reliably play with and are fine with or even prefer some of the more gearhead aspects of RPGs, then &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Defenders&lt;/em&gt; is a title in your wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; offered a few different things in terms of classes to play. Instead of the base class evolving to whatever degree of magic you wanted in the first game or the skill tree of the second game, the initial class decision forces different roles and play styles. Passive skills were added to help balance player style, but were limited to experience in the beta. Barbarian and Wizard are carried over from previous games in the series. Demon Hunter, Monk and Witch Doctor have been added to Diablo III. These offer a new flavor to the series, as they are different than anything we've seen in the past.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; offered a few different things in terms of classes to play. Instead of the base class evolving to whatever degree of magic you wanted in the first game or the skill tree of the second game, the initial class decision forces different roles and play styles. Passive skills were added to help balance player style, but were limited to experience in the beta. Barbarian and Wizard are carried over from previous games in the series. Demon Hunter, Monk and Witch Doctor have been added to Diablo III. These offer a new flavor to the series, as they are different than anything we&amp;#8217;ve seen in the past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-366"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of the past, gone is the option to select your skills based on trees for the class. Instead spells and abilities are unlocked at different levels. Also, &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; only allows a player to have up to six active abilities at level 24 and three passive ones at 30. It leaves the ability to upgrade your actions of choice a little up the in air. There are new items that upgrade or change skills scattered through the game. Augmentations called rune stones are available that you tie to specific skills rather than equipment. Gems are still available for armor and weapons. The old generic mana pool is practically gone as well. It is now replaced by class specific pools: rage (Barbarian), spirit (Monk), hatred and discipline (Demon Hunter), arcane power (Wizard), and mana (Witch Doctor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-diablo-3-beta-class-breakdown/attachment/diablo-3-barbarian/" rel="attachment wp-att-367"&gt;&lt;img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-367" title="Diablo 3 - Barbarian" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Barbarian.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" width="200" height="290" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was very clear to me that the Barbarian was going to be &lt;em&gt;Diablo III’s&lt;/em&gt; easiest and most over powered class. The Barbarian has been given cleave which with one swing attacks multiple enemies unfortunate to be standing in front of you. Cleave is an area affect attack awarded very early in the game. It makes managing hordes almost too easy as you switch to your cleave as your primary attack. While not as powerful or efficient as some other rage generating attacks, it pans out over time since you are doing damage to multiple monsters at once. Once you get a two-handed weapon things get really nutty. Due to the higher damage on the larger weapons, cleave murders common monsters in one or two swings. Rage building slows because of it. It isn’t fully apparent if the balance of this will change over time, but all the way through the beta I was having this problem. What it all boils down to, is this is a front and center class. You will build to take hits and take out packs of mobs with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-diablo-3-beta-class-breakdown/attachment/diablo-3-monk/" rel="attachment wp-att-371"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-371" title="Diablo 3 - Monk" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Monk.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" width="200" height="290" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Playing the monk will appeal to those of you are that familiar with the hybrid style classes. That is, melee classes that are spliced with spell casters weakening both, but giving benefits of both. Most commonly a paladin or ranger would fit into this description. The monk can heal, which puts it at an importance for grouping scenarios. Solo situations are another story though. The monk is sort of squishy. They can do OK damage, but you&amp;#8217;ll rely on secondary healing skills and stuns heavily to be as effective as others. It is important that you use a spirit generating attack as your primary to make full use of your abilities. Otherwise you&amp;#8217;ll have to depend on potion healing. With a new cool down timer on potions, that makes that path troublesome. Monks are traditionally thought of as using martial-arts style weapons only. &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; breaks from that a little here as I was able to equip daggers and axes. It leaves me wondering why Bo staffs are touted for them though. Sure, damage is higher, but with the spirit draining issue for heals and what not, I would think you would want to be hitting as fast as possible. It&amp;#8217;ll come down to personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the Demon Hunter, Witch Doctor, and Wizard on the next page!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Das Kalk is back with us for another week as we try not to go to far over the top. Too bad we did anyway! Emdee cracks the whip to keep us in line, but in the end conforms to the madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics jumbling around this week include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How twisted is &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; AOL&amp;#8217;s developed an unmanned data center. How smart is this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Google&amp;#8217;s being audited by the Man!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Blizzard&amp;#8217;s server blade auction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Das Kalk discusses his new iPhone 4s and &lt;em&gt;Toy Soldiers: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Emdee&amp;#8217;s time with the GP2X Caanoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Continuing &lt;em&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/em&gt; beta discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Guess what?  The SOE hack saga continues!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The iCloud and iPhone 4s sales are not so smooth&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why and how did Blackberry&amp;#8217;s internet service go down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Got a PS3? Keep it more up to date than we do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And all the normal off-topic insanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>A few weekends ago I was awoken by an familiar sound. On my bedside my phone had chirped at me, proposing that I should take a look at it. The announcement indicated a message from my podcasting co-host, asking me what I thought was a cryptic message at the time. Perhaps it was just the simple question asking me if I had a Battle.net account or the fact that his damn e-mail rose me from a nap, but I hastily replied before collapsing once more onto my bed. A few minutes later, the phone chirped again. He mentioned to me that he was going to try and get us a beta invite for the Diablo 3 beta. Thinking that it was a one in a million shot for a small outfit like ours, I said "Good luck" in less than kind words and tried to sleep for a little longer.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-diablo-3-beta-the-overview/attachment/diablo-3-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-360"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Banner.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 Banner" width="700" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weekends ago I was awoken by an familiar sound. On my bedside my phone had chirped at me, proposing that I should take a look at it. The announcement indicated a message from my podcasting co-host, asking me what I thought was a cryptic message at the time. Perhaps it was just the simple question asking me if I had a Battle.net account or the fact that his damn e-mail rose me from a nap, but I hastily replied before collapsing once more onto my bed. A few minutes later, the phone chirped again. He mentioned to me that he was going to try and get us a beta invite for the &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; beta. Thinking that it was a one in a million shot for a small outfit like ours, I said &amp;#8220;Good luck&amp;#8221; in less than kind words and tried to sleep for a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to find out, we did get an invite. Mmm, crow. Yummy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-361"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Loading the game up after a seamless download through &lt;a href="http://www.battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but find a lot of things similar to the previous games &lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; has released.  The launcher looks the same as with &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, but one really can&amp;#8217;t expect Blizzard to move away with something that works. The title screen opened to a haunting background with ominous music. Again, looking very familiar to the layout of the starting screen for &lt;em&gt;WoW&lt;/em&gt;, it was easy to navigate through. One thing that Blizzard continues to excel at through all of their games are coherent user interfaces with easy menus that don&amp;#8217;t aim to confuse the player or lose them in complicated options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_355" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-diablo-3-beta-the-overview/attachment/diablo-3-creation/" rel="attachment wp-att-355"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Creation.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 - Creation" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-355" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As you can see, nothing outside of the gender selection button was added for character customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was offered a taste of disappointment when I went into character creation. &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; as a series has bottlenecked players into pre-set characters that never offered any customization. &lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t really any better in that regard. Sure they made it so you could actually select the gender of the class, it still leaves one wanting more. Considering the level of options you have in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#8217;d think that there would be some carry over. Not much changed from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo III&lt;/em&gt; plays out like we never stepped out of the story for the previous two games. All the familiar tropes are there, slaying monsters, collecting loot, and helping the helpless. The lore and world building remain second to none. Little gems are sprinkled all over that tip their hat to fans of the franchise since the beginning. The old physical traits of playing the game are much the same as well. The two button mouse system of clicking carried over from &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;. You assign abilities to primary and secondary buttons, as before. You then proceed to click yourself into carpal tunnel syndrome. Combats will eventually boil down to spamming mouse button clicks. I&amp;#8217;d hoped that they would get away from that. Again, why break what isn&amp;#8217;t broken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_357" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-diablo-3-beta-the-overview/attachment/diablo-3-lore/" rel="attachment wp-att-357"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Lore.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 - Lore" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-357" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The lore in Diablo 3 remains as strong as ever. Bringing back characters like Deckard Cain and King Leoric show that they want to keep true to what they&amp;#039;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years in the making should mean that we should be killing it in the graphics department. There is no doubt that everything looks better than before, but not as much as one would expect. Destructible physics have been added for the beta, but some other expected features like anti-aliasing have been skipped and will wait for the release. Gone are the polished, shiny look that stuck to every player model from &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;, but something is still off. I just can’t quite put my finger on it. The textures look pretty good, especially when you compare them to other games in the genre. Perhaps they just don&amp;#8217;t look as great on the NPCs due to the holding back of some of the graphic options to shrink the size of the beta. The lighting engine seems to be done to perfection. Fantastic radiance envelops abilities that neither distract nor overwhelm from the animations. The highlights and shadows play well to the atmosphere and textures as well. Simple things like lanterns and torches seem to glow appropriately, but still have that soft, warm light you&amp;#8217;d expect from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click over to the next page to see what else Draeno thinks about his time in the beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We start somber, but pick up speed quickly. Join us this week with our friends Das Kalk and Anubis while we battle through childcare issues and crappy internet connections. While obviously we have to talk about the passing of Steve Jobs, we moved on into more &amp;#8220;spirited&amp;#8221; conversation. Four people clog up the pipes a little on top of the internet attack which made things a sort of hectic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting through the issues topics we cover include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We mourn the passing of Steve Jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The iPhone 4S is a solid device, why all the complaints?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; TV over IP on the Xbox, coming this holiday season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Leonard Nimoy&amp;#8217;s last &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; convention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Where do turkey necks &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/04/opinion/bennett-men-in-trouble/index.html?&amp;#038;hpt=hp_c2" target="_blank"&gt;get off telling us how to behave?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Get sucked into a BF3 beta hacked server? Ready for the ban hammer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And our normal shenanigans and off topicry&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>As I walk an eerily twisting path in this wretched land, I cannot help but feel that I've been here before. The undead torment the living.

The falling star I've been sent to investigate has stirred something in this land. Why do the horrors haunt this region so?

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-the-monks-path-in-diablo-3-beta-2/attachment/diablo-3-preview-header/" rel="attachment wp-att-335"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Preview-Header.jpg" alt="" title="Diablo 3 Preview Header" width="700" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-335" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walk an eerily twisting path in this wretched land, I cannot help but feel that I&amp;#8217;ve been here before. The undead torment the living. The monsters come out to unleash their frustration in the world. Commoners hide within the shells of the city that they used to call home. What set this off? The falling star I&amp;#8217;ve been sent to investigate has stirred something in this land. Why do the horrors haunt this region so? New Tristram, its predecessor freed from torment so long ago, now faces its own brand of troubles.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_328" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-the-monks-path-in-diablo-3-beta-2/attachment/diablo-3-overview-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-328"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Overview-1.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 Overview 1" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-328" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The path towards my goal is littered with the feeding undead. I must quickly dispatch them before I become food myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the gate I can see that this new barrage of the creatures from beyond has taken a toll on the men that protect this city. You can see the horror flicker in their weary eyes as they stand on their last nerves to defend their town. Captain Rumford, the last pillar of leadership for this aching town, speaks to me, warding me from the walls. He agrees to allow my entrance into town once he witnesses my fighting prowess against a large wave of undead. Walking through the gates you can tell that even protected, the town is losing its nerve. Family members have been lost, while others are missing or ran away. Rumford directed me in the direction of the Slaughtered Calf Inn to start my search for answers. Within, a local townswoman- Leah, tells me of her lost uncle, Deckard Cain. I agree to aid her in looking for him as I work towards the cathedral where I was told the fallen star had landed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_329" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-the-monks-path-in-diablo-3-beta-2/attachment/diablo-3-overview-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-329"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Overview-2.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 Overview 2" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-329" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;At the gates of New Tristram, I show my fighting abilities to the Captain of the guard. After seeing that I can easily dispatch these monsters, I am allowed into town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk, punch and bash my way through this wretched wilderness. It seems that the evil in this land works against me as I inch closer towards the church. This land literally puts me in a path of harm’s way. Each step brings something from the woods or under my feet in an attempt to dispatch me. Pushing on I come into the remains of the original Tristram, the town left behind from the troubles long ago. The buildings are falling apart. The moss is thick on the brick walls, eroding at their foundations. Time has not been kind here. Griswold’s smithy offers some weaponry charity among its piles of rock and tinder. Impeccable timing, as the new denizens decided it was opportune to come for my flesh. They pose no challenge to my overwhelming spirit, even their Wretched Queen.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_330" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-the-monks-path-in-diablo-3-beta-2/attachment/diablo-3-overview-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-330"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Overview-3.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 Overview 3" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-330" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Few memories remain in this decrepit town. There are few things left behind but the dead themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Captain tasked me with slaying the Queen in the shambled village, I head back to New Tristram to see if anything new had to be offered from the townspeople once done. The woman I spoke with before is now clearly anxious to find her lost uncle. Together we agree to strike back out towards a local hut that belonged to her mother. We come to find more than we bargained for. Beneath this shanty lies the remains of the guard set to protect the people of this area. Instead they perished and their undead remains are now left to protect a key to enter the cathedral. Once the soldiers were put to their final rest by our hands, Leah finds the journal left behind by her mother beside the key. She hands me the key, but remains to flip though the journal. I carry on out of the cellar only to be greeted by more foes. They press against my advance towards the church. When I cut the last of them down, I make my way into the holy temple. The only entrance to the depths below was caved in when the meteor crashed down, leaving me to enter through the crater. Whatever caused this furrow seems to have stirred something deep inside the earth. The further down I crawl, the more hideous things I&amp;#8217;m greeted by- animated skeletons, corrupt flying creatures and even exploding abominations that provide a fight after death. Upon my entrance to the second level of the underbelly, I spot a old man fleeing for his life. This must be the Deckard Cain I was sent to look for. Unfortunately, it seems that he has brought something along with him. A skeletal king follows him ordering minions to end his life. I stave off the gang of skeletons allowing me to be able to bring Cain back to the safety of the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_331" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-preview-the-monks-path-in-diablo-3-beta-2/attachment/diablo-3-overview-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-331"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Diablo-3-Overview-4.jpg" alt="Diablo 3, Blizzard, Monk, Adventure, Diablo III, Tristram, Deckard Cain, Templar, monsters, evil, wizard, witch doctor, berserker, demon hunter, battle.net, beta, story, preview" title="Diablo 3 Overview 4" width="640" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-331" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The deep, glowing light trailing behind the impact of the falling star offers little but an omen of what trouble lies beneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrive via portal to town, Leah welcomes back the uncle she thought was lost. As they talk, Cain informs us that the king was indeed old King Leroic who had succumbed to the evils of this land some time ago. To bring an end to his newest undead reign, Cain sends me to find his blackened crown in a far away graveyard. Before I depart, I must locate the town&amp;#8217;s blacksmith to see if he will help me in reforging the crown. Upon finding him, I am welcomed with a plea for help. The poor man&amp;#8217;s wife has been infected with the ailment that has been turning average people into the undead. Unable to end her suffering on his own, I agree to help him end her suffering. Once the deed is done, he agrees to help me. I set off through the northern gate of the town only to run into more of the same creatures standing in my way. Even some strange beings that try to distract me with promises of treasure before stepping into a portal to the unknown. As I finally make my way to the gates of the cemetery, I can&amp;#8217;t help but wonder how much longer this will go on. My body aches, my knuckles bleed, my will falters. It takes inner reflection to remind me just how important it is that I go on. The graveyard is full of crypts making this retrieval job just a little more tasking. After pushing on through three different tombs, I finally come to the altar of the fabled black crown. There seems to be something stopping me. A Chancellor of days gone by guards this crown even in death. Not wanting some unsuspecting fool to raise the skeleton king again, he fights me to the death. Unfortunately, it was that specter&amp;#8217;s undoing. I take the crown in hand and prepare to transport back to the smith by an odd, portal opening stone I found along the way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombie fans rejoice! Or groan and shamble towards your next meal. Whatever it is you folks do. Friday, the newly divided &lt;a href="http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had worked out a multi-year deal with &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; that would bring the hit show &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; to their online streaming service. Now available, the show based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kirkman"&gt;Robert Kirkman&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; graphic works by the same name, shows up just in time for the second season premiere on October 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, other hit AMC shows like &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; have been streaming on &lt;a href="http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; for some time. With this new announcement, viewers can expect to see more shows from the cable channel launching previous seasons online just before the newest season begins airing on TV. Not only does this cover AMC, but also grants non-exclusive deals for shows from &lt;a href="http://www.ifc.com/"&gt;IFC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sundancechannel.com/"&gt;Sundance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wetv.com/"&gt;WE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC Mag reports that &amp;#8220;[Adding shows to Netflix] brings our content to a wider audience, and it provides additional revenue to support production of new shows,&amp;#8221; said AMC Networks President and CEO Josh Sapan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if only &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; would stop killing off its show runners and writers, we might be able to keep the show&amp;#8217;s head attached.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently running at $6.99 on the market place, it seems a fair price to pay for itching your creative needs when you aren&amp;#8217;t able to sit down at the computer. Still not convinced? Download the demo first to see if it is worth the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 10/8, 11:00PM Pacific time the app wasn&amp;#8217;t available on the market place through T-mobile, but shows as purchasable at the &lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe"&gt;Android Market&lt;/a&gt; online and through Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-burnout-crash/attachment/burnout-crash-title/" rel="attachment wp-att-342"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Burnout-Crash-Title.png" alt="Burnout Crash, Electronic Arts, Title" title="Burnout Crash Title" width="600" height="262" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think crashing Matchbox or Hot Wheel cars together is a requirement to pass some birthday as a young boy.  The seventh, maybe eighth.  For some, the glee of virtual crashes never ceases, and this market is what Electronic Arts and Criterion Games is targeting with &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt;.  Cutting through the crap, &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt; is an arcade crash simulator. Any other pesky game elements in previous Burnout titles like car racing have been excised, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-339"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m going to get this out of the way first.  I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of most auto games, racing or not. I do like the &lt;em&gt;Burnout&lt;/em&gt; series overall a great deal.  &lt;em&gt;Burnout&lt;/em&gt; has never been a serious attempt to simulate street racing, it&amp;#8217;s not a &lt;em&gt;Grand Turismo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ridge Racer&lt;/em&gt; by any stretch of the imagination.  The series has always glorified speed and the physics poetry defined by the meter of automobile crashes.  &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt; eschews the normal 3rd person or windshield views that previous games in the series have used, and have gone straight to the top down style.  Think the viewpoint of the first two &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; titles, rather than &lt;em&gt;Carmageddon&lt;/em&gt;.  Straight up, you start in the bottom of the map with the intent of causing as much destruction in your wake as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_341" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-burnout-crash/attachment/burnout-crash-play/" rel="attachment wp-att-341"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Burnout-Crash-play.jpg" alt="Burnout Crash, Play Example, Crashbreaker" title="Burnout Crash Play" width="575" height="323" class="size-full wp-image-341" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This is the screen you&amp;#039;ll be staring at most of the time.  Can you find your car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with a single crash- your car into a bus, or other such mundane accident.  Once the carnage begins, your Crash Breaker bar starts to fill.  The more damage you cause, the faster it fills.  After your crash breaker bar fills up completely, you can detonate your car, and you have a modicum of control over it&amp;#8217;s trajectory with the return of the aftertouch mechanic from previous Burnout titles.  Ideally, you want to ricochet off as many items as possible, and bank those cars, dumpsters, what have you into other objects.  Repeat until the parameters of the game type are fulfilled.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Road Trip&lt;/strong&gt; mode, you can keep this cycle going as long as five cars haven&amp;#8217;t escaped, or until you&amp;#8217;ve destroyed a set amount of cars per stage.  If the five cars escape, the level ends without fanfare.  If you&amp;#8217;ve maxed out the destruction, a level-clearing apocalyptic event like a hurricane or UFO visits the remaining undamaged surrounding structures adding to your point total.  If an ambulance escapes, then one car is subtracted from your total, but as the &lt;a href="http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/09/30" target="_blank"&gt;gents from penny-arcade implied&lt;/a&gt;, the Ambulance seems to be made of cardboard soaked in gasoline.  This is not a good thing.  A little more durability from a player support mechanism would have been welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pile-Up&lt;/strong&gt; mode starts with a high score modifier that drops from 5x to 1x as cars escape your clutches.  So, your goal is still to prevent the escapes.  Regardless of how many cars escape, the level ends with an inferno that can theoretically continue forever, as long as something is burning on the map.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/strong&gt; is time based, challenging you to destroy as much crap as possible in 90 seconds.  This also ends in fire- when the time is up, your car explodes with massive force, launching local items into the surrounding countryside, and hopefully causing untold damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_340" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-burnout-crash/attachment/burnout-crash-pizza/" rel="attachment wp-att-340"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Burnout-crash-pizza.jpg" alt="Burnout Crash, Pizza of Destruction, Bulldozer" title="Burnout crash pizza of destruction" width="620" height="349" class="size-full wp-image-340" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Pizza Wheel.  It&amp;#039;s not all good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout Crash is entertaining, and inherently frustrating.  It is the epitome of a game that feels like work sometimes, and the level design seems oriented towards the &amp;#8220;one true solution&amp;#8221; method of game design.  In Road Trip mode, the crash breakers not only propel you towards other targets, but it more often than not scatters your existing carnage you relied on to prevent the traffic from getting through.  Some may call it a tactical decision to set off the crash breaker, but it&amp;#8217;s less tactical than necessary to thump that button as often as possible.  Pile-Up mode has a heavy reliance on a pizza truck coming through the level to deliver a spin on a wheel of prizes to you upon it&amp;#8217;s destruction.  This wheel delivers power-ups like a temporary score multiplier or serious penalties like a bulldozer coming through.  I don&amp;#8217;t think some of the score targets the game requires you to make to collect stars for better vehicles to be even possible to obtain without these multipliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never been a big fan of grinding to unlock what you want to play in a game.  Grinding for the perfect +5 amulet of destruction in some sort of hack and slash is one thing, but when a game feels like work to get to the good parts, it&amp;#8217;s not fun to play.  I found Rush Hour to be a very satisfying mode, but to get there I was forced to play Road Trip and Pile Up modes as well.  Multiplayer mode is either the leader board challenges that your friends can give you over xBox Live or a strange Kinect implementation with a gesture that a second party has to do to invoke the crash breaker explosion.  There&amp;#8217;s no way that this was included as anything more than an afterthought to put the Kinect integration icon on the marketing materials.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt; because Mike at Penny-Arcade spoke pretty highly of it.  I bought &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/em&gt; and a few other titles for the same reason, and I wasn&amp;#8217;t ever disappointed. I don&amp;#8217;t blame Mike- all of my irritations with the game he spoke about.  I just didn&amp;#8217;t think they&amp;#8217;d be that bad, since i had so much fun with previous &lt;em&gt;Burnout&lt;/em&gt; titles.  &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt; feels incomplete.  Game design decisions were made that impede the good times that are possible with this game.  The levels are sometimes frustrating, random chance has way too much influence on your fate with certain goals, and grinding game types you don&amp;#8217;t want to play to release game types you want is irritating.  This all sounds very harsh.  &lt;em&gt;Burnout Crash&lt;/em&gt; is a decent game through it all but I just can&amp;#8217;t recommend you spend 800 points for it.  At 400, it deserves some thought  If it ever hits the 200 point range in a sale, I think that&amp;#8217;s the sweet spot for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game was purchased by reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>It was recently announced that &lt;a href="http://www.red5studios.com/"&gt;Red 5 Studios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.webzen.com/Default.aspx"&gt;Webzen Inc.&lt;/a&gt; reached an agreement to bring to a close all of the legal issues that had been filed against one another.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/red-5-studios-and-webzen-games-reach-agreement/attachment/red-5-webzen-banner/" rel="attachment wp-att-326"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Red-5-Webzen-Banner.jpg" alt="Red 5 Studios, Webzen, The9, Firefall, World of Warcraft, agreement, online shooter" title="Red-5-Webzen-Banner" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-326" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was recently announced that &lt;a href="http://www.red5studios.com/"&gt;Red 5 Studios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.webzen.com/Default.aspx"&gt;Webzen Inc.&lt;/a&gt; reached an agreement to bring to a close all of the legal issues that had been filed against one another. In the agreement, Red 5 received global publishing rights to &lt;a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/home"&gt;Firefall&lt;/a&gt;, the free to play online shooter announced in 2008. The cost for Red 5 is to compensate Webzen for development fees that were paid to them under a prior arrangement. While Webzen will not be involved in the publishing or marketing arm of the game (which is now in the hands of Red 5 Singapore), they do have something else to look forward to in Firefall’s future. Red 5 will have to share future revenue that the title generates with Webzen for an undisclosed amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-325"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mark Kern, CEO of Red 5 Studios said, &amp;#8220;Given the resolution of all disputes and conflicts between our two companies I would like to ask for our fans, especially Chinese and Korean gamers,’ continuous encouragement and support in Firefall and Red 5.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave the progress for the game? Hopefully in a positive direction. Given the fact that Red 5 is looking to make a large impact with Firefall in the Asian markets, does striking out without Webzen on their side give them the best chance? It might not turn out as bad as you think. With &lt;a href="http://www.the9.com/en/"&gt;The9&lt;/a&gt; acquiring a majority share of the Red 5 Studios back in March 2010, hopefully their experience with titles like &lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; (after Webzen had their go at it) should hope to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the press releases below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
RED 5 STUDIOS AND WEBZEN HAVE AGREED TO END THE DISPUTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>I didn't know Steve Jobs personally. His company and products have weaved in and out of my life since the original Apple II launch when my prescient parents saw the writing on the wall and only wanted the best for me.  It was so early in the run, the odds are his fingerprints were on the case someplace.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/steve-jobs-1955-2011/attachment/steve-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-327"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Steve.jpg" alt="Apple, Steve Jobs, Innovator, Genius, Visionary, Pixar, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Macintosh" title="Steve" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-327" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt; So long, Steve. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emdee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#8217;t know Steve Jobs personally. His company and products have weaved in and out of my life since the original Apple II launch when my prescient parents saw the writing on the wall and only wanted the best for me.  It was so early in the run, the odds are his fingerprints were on the case someplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jobs&amp;#8217; design philosophies have influenced computing, and me along the way.  I am who I am, from a technological standpoint because of his design decisions.  I&amp;#8217;ve (briefly) spoken with him on two occasions.  Say what you will about the man, his company, their practices, their products- the computer and media industries wouldn&amp;#8217;t be where they are today without his hand on the reins.  The industry will feel this hand for probably a decade, whether or not they know it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not your view of Steve is Think Different, For the Rest of Us, One More Thing, or the Power to Crush the Other Kids, we are all poorer for his loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draeno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot deny the innovator that Steve Jobs was. His products were always around in my life, be it if I wanted them there or not. Through out my school days we were always surrounded by the Apple IIe, Macintosh, and iMac computers. I was even introduced to the fantastic world of graphic design through the use of Adobe products on his machines. You can&amp;#8217;t deny that with the creation of Apple, the computer market had to step up its game. We might not even have Windows had he not had the tenacity to find his own path to happiness. He was a man that constantly pushed the boundaries in a consumer market that was always hungry for more. The world was touched and influenced by his contributions. Now you can&amp;#8217;t walk five feet in any direction without seeing something that he had a part in, great or small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not forget his contributions to the film industry either. Without him being ousted by Apple in 1986, Pixar may not have grown to be the power house that it is. From Toy Story to The Incredibles to Wall E, Pixar developed films for everyone. These films will be around for our children&amp;#8217;s children to enjoy as they all have staying power in them that pulls at our heart strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, even stubborn people like me started to come around to his vision world. I eventually bought two iPod shuffles quite late into the game, but found them to be necessity. More recently I was wowed by the iPad, which will become a staple in this home. Even still before that I was able to enjoy Pixar films with my family. Steve had an eye for both design and perfection. My thoughts and wishes go out to his family. Let it be known, that he had the power to sway even the most stubborn converts like myself.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>It wasn’t bad enough that Doctor Who had its budget cut down significantly this year. Nor did the show smooth anyone over when it went out with a whimper this season. Nothing was getting any better when we were told that we wouldn’t see new episodes for it until Fall 2012 either. Announced last week, the BBC is now halting production on the behind the scenes portion of the show, Doctor Who Confidential.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=324"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Doctor-Confidential-Header.jpg" alt="Doctor Who, BBC, BBC3, Confidential, Cancel, TV, Sci-fi, Zai Bennett, funding, budget cuts, Delivering Quality First initiative" title="Doctor-Confidential-Header" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-324" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t bad enough that Doctor Who had its budget cut down significantly this year. Nor did the show smooth anyone over when it went out with a whimper this season. Nothing was getting any better when we were told that we wouldn’t see new episodes for it until Fall 2012 either. Announced last week, the BBC is now halting production on the behind the scenes portion of the show, Doctor Who Confidential.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-320"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/28/doctor-who-confidential-axed"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, BBC controller Zai Bennett decided to put a stop to the show which aired on BBC3, as part of further cost cutting for the network. Instead of carrying on with the documentary style show while faced with 20% budget cuts, the network decided to shutter the show in order to use the funding towards new, original shows as part of their Delivering Quality First initiative. The strategy of the initiative is to be unveiled on October 6th, so we’ll see just what diverting the funding from a popular segment will do for the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BBC spokeswoman had this to say about the decision:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;The Doctor Who spin-off series, Doctor Who Confidential, has been a great show for BBC3 over the years, but our priority now is to build on original British commissions, unique to the channel.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does leave a few questions hanging out in the wind for fans of the current iteration of Doctor Who. Will this effect the quality of extras that have been coming on the DVD releases? Will this mean the next season will have a little more funding that the skin and bones of the just ending Series 6? Could this be another sign that the BBC pulling away from its flagship title? We have a long wait ahead of us to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this isn’t a further sign of what is to come for the future of Doctor Who. Fans, if I were you, I’d stop rallying to save Doctor Who Confidential. Not to say that it wasn’t a great insight into the show, but I’m starting to think that the energy would better be stored away for a time when we will need to convince the BBC to keep Doctor Who running. It is a fantastic show that we all love, but as with all modern era TV shows it lives in a finite window for audience interest and studio funding. It just might be a good idea to let this small part of the show fade into the black for the greater good of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Tower defense. The industry is full of it. No, really. Seriously, there's like hundreds of them. I've popped balloons, blasted scribbles, fried demons, reduced geometric shapes to particle effects, and yes, even blasted some orcs. What I haven't done until &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; by is both set up tower defenses and shoot Orcs in the face up close and personal, third person style! &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Robot Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; is the latest entry in the crowded tower defense genre, available now on the xBox Live marketplace.  </description>

&lt;p&gt;Tower defense. The industry is full of it. No, really. Seriously, there&amp;#8217;s like hundreds of them. I&amp;#8217;ve popped balloons, blasted scribbles, fried demons, reduced geometric shapes to particle effects, and yes, even blasted some orcs. What I haven&amp;#8217;t done until &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; by is both set up tower defenses and shoot Orcs in the face up close and personal, third person style! &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.robotentertainment.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Robot Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; is the latest entry in the crowded tower defense genre, available now on the xBox Live marketplace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-307"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Enter grizzled old War Mage, stage left. He&amp;#8217;s got the full &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf"&gt;Gandalf&lt;/a&gt; beard with voice stylings like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Diablo#Deckard_Cain"&gt;Deckard Cain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, the whole trope, it&amp;#8217;s all here. Many orcs died at this man&amp;#8217;s hands and the traps he laid to get the job done. You get the idea. However, permanently exit grizzled old War Mage via back of the head brain smash to the edge of the stairs. He wasn&amp;#8217;t pushed by an orc, no. He slipped on a pool of blood. You, the not-so grizzled square jaw broski War Mage apprentice must then defend the Order&amp;#8217;s Rift Fortresses, home to the magical rifts that connect the worlds. In the beginning you just have a few tools at your disposal. A sword staff thing that defies rational description and crossbow for personal dispatch. Tar traps and floor spikes for keeping your hands clean. Defend the rift at all costs with every tool you have available to you. Quite literally, Orcs Must Die!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_313" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-orcs-must-die/attachment/windbeltscreen06/" rel="attachment wp-att-313"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/WindBeltScreen06-1024x576.jpg" alt="Orcs Must Die, Robot Entertainment, zero day purchase, Third Person, Weavers, orc launcher, xBox Live, War Mage, Rift Fortress," title="The Wind Belt tossing orcs around." width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-313" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Wind belt, tossing orcs around. Good for launching them into deep holes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, more defenses become available as time progresses. It doesn&amp;#8217;t take long to get exploding barrels. Convenient Orc Launchers, or snooty elf archers to assist you in your quest. Generally, any device you can imagine that will help you spindle, fold, mutilate, and otherwise poorly treat Orcs and their fellow minions is unlockable and improvable as you progress in the 24 level campaign. Defenses aren&amp;#8217;t limited to the floor only. One of your first unlockables is an arrow wall, capable of destroying many orcs with one volley of arrows if properly placed. Crushers splatter from a nearby ceiling. Autoballistas shoot large arrows from higher ceilings. Even the environment helps. Drop chandeliers onto unexpecting mobs. Launch orcs into lava or water, or just into the deepest pit you can see by trap or magical device you unlock and can wield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever has infinite resources to set defenses. Before the orcs break down the door or doors leading into your complex, the tasking has already begun. You&amp;#8217;ve got to decide from your available tools what you&amp;#8217;re bringing to the fight. While there&amp;#8217;s no obvious &amp;#8220;knife to a gunfight&amp;#8221; problem that I&amp;#8217;ve seen, your choices given the level geometry can make things easier or harder. If you&amp;#8217;ve unlocked them, you can use the Weavers. Weavers (for the right price) allow the purchase of advantages for your traps or yourself like quicker resetting traps, or fire damage for your crossbow. You&amp;#8217;ve got a finite amount of coins to set up your initial attempt to repel the hordes. Maybe there&amp;#8217;s an easy choke point, maybe there isn&amp;#8217;t. Maybe you can make a maze with barricades but whatever you&amp;#8217;ve got, you go to war with what you have and not necessarily what you want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_312" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-orcs-must-die/attachment/wallbladesscreenshot8/" rel="attachment wp-att-312"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/WallBladesScreenshot8-1024x576.jpg" alt="Orcs Must Die, Robot Entertainment, zero day purchase, Third Person, Weavers, orc launcher, xBox Live, War Mage, Rift Fortress," title="Orcs Must Die Wall Blades" width="640" height="360" class="size-large wp-image-312" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Wall blades, doing what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you murder the incoming masses, you collect coins depending on the style or manner in which they&amp;#8217;ve been dispatched. Kill a bunch at once? More coins. Kill with combos, like launching orcs with a launcher trap into a blade wall? That&amp;#8217;s more coins than just whacking one over the head with your sword staff thing. Shoot an orc in the skull? More. After each minor wave, you&amp;#8217;ve got at tops 15 seconds to drop down more defenses with your hard earned sponduliks. Periodically, there&amp;#8217;s a big payout and an equally large horde to follow. You have as much time as you want to build your traps up or visit the Weavers with the coins you have on hand before you release the hordes to try and breach your defenses once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking. More tech or magic. It&amp;#8217;s the inevitable march. As you complete levels in &lt;em&gt;Orcs Must Die&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#8217;re awarded skulls for your performance. One orc hits the rift? Minus one of five skulls. Take too long? &lt;strong&gt;Bam&lt;/strong&gt;! There goes another one. Generally, the less you suck, the more skulls you earn. If you wimp out and play a level on an easier difficulty, you&amp;#8217;re capped at 2 out of the max 5 skulls. It behooves you to play on as difficult a level as you can muster. These skulls can be saved or cashed in at the end of each level to upgrade your defenses or magical devices. Some devices become cheaper, like barricades for making a defacto maze for the orcs to pass through as you place them. Some do more damage like blade walls, or do it farther away like arrow walls. I do have to say, you don&amp;#8217;t get a good indicator of what your bonus is for upgrades- I saved 12 skulls for cheaper barricade walls. The benefit for saving my skulls? The barricade cost went down from 800 coins to 700. Hardly a bargain. I really should have dropped the cash at the time on better arrow walls, which seem to be my primary Orc deterrent even late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read on to see if the Orc massacre was worth the wait!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan. Home of Godzilla, pocky, and animation of many flavors and tastes. Like French Halo early &amp;#8220;releases&amp;#8221;, Apple Japan spilled the beans a bit early on the iPhone situation.  As I&amp;#8217;ve been predicting for months on the podcast, the new iPhone is a 4s, and not a revolutionary teardrop 4G iPhone 5. There&amp;#8217;s a method to my madness, and a certain logic to how Apple releases iPhones. It&amp;#8217;s easy to see if you look for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-305"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To really get a good feel for Apple release cycles, you have to go back to the iTunes store, and it&amp;#8217;s integration with the iPod. In Apple&amp;#8217;s eye, products beget new, related products. In 1999, this chain began with iTunes. Then there was the iPod in 2001, which relied on iTunes to do it&amp;#8217;s thing. iTunes begat bigger iPods, and the iTunes store in 2003. In 2007, Apple spawned the iPod touch in it&amp;#8217;s initial form, which really didn&amp;#8217;t seem to fit at the time. Then the 2nd version of the iPod touch operating system was released, with appstore hooks, and an easy way to add more functionality to the device. Only after the iTunes store and the applications were in full swing, did the true iPhone (not the ROKR) come to life later in 2007. This in turn spawned the iPad in 2010 with it&amp;#8217;s own set of untrue rumors about it over the summer of 2011 in regards to a new device less than six months after it&amp;#8217;s second revision which was a major one in a similar vein to the original iPhone versus the iPhone 3g.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original iPhone was a decent device, at decent but not amazing speeds. Wifi was great, but the EDGE network didn&amp;#8217;t pump you the data that quickly on the device.  The second iteration was much better with the faster 3G network, but the same processor and RAM. Released third was the iPhone 3gs, with a 50% greater clock speed and double the application RAM, but overall, it was faster but not amazingly faster than it&amp;#8217;s previous revision. With the release of the iPhone 4 came a matching A4 processor to the then new iPad, the higher resolution retina display, a 33% processor speed increase, and another doubling of the application RAM. The iPhone 4 was the first phone since the first iteration of the 3g released two years prior to be a significant upgrade over the previous version. Each iteration has improvements, but major leaps seem to happen every two years. Not coincidentally, the length of most contracts with wireless providers is two years, and Apple knows this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the just announced (single model, thanks anyway, Mr. Gore) iPhone 4S as announced by Apple&amp;#8217;s new CEO Tim Cook in somewhat less flamboyant fashion than Mr. Jobs would have. It&amp;#8217;s an improvement, yes. It sports a dual core processor, the A5. The A5 is the same processor that&amp;#8217;s made the iPad 2 a significantly faster machine than the original iPad. There is a camera increased to 8 megapixels with better optics in the new phone.  Cook provides some Apple benchmarks of graphics seven times faster, but as with any manufacturer provided advertising speak, it should be taken with a grain of salt. It is now a &amp;#8220;world phone&amp;#8221; with user switchable GSM and CDMA. The rumored voice assistant feature, Siri, is included in beta form in the iPhone 4s, but I&amp;#8217;m not going to qualify it as an true success until it sees some field time and how well it performs under different acoustical environments or the strain of regional accents. No other super fast wireless network other than some discussion of a better antenna and the potential for a faster theoretical maximum download speed because of it. No new teardrop case. No thinner. Same size screen. The price points remain the same with the addition of a 64 gigabyte model for $399, and all three capacities available starting October 14th.  The 8 gigabyte iPhone 4 is available for $99 with a two year contract. Surprisingly, the the 8 gigabyte iPhone 3gs is available for free with a two year commitment to AT+T. The iPod revisions or iOS applications Cook and company talked about accompanying the iOS 5 release on October 12th like News Stand, the new Camera app, Apple&amp;#8217;s own Foursquare killer, Twitter integration, or Cards are fine and probably as good as the Apple hype suggests but really beyond the scope of this discussion. Regardless of the hardware, there will always be apps that do cool or interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my apparent griping, this event has overall been a good one for Apple. The iPhone 4S is a solid device, but it&amp;#8217;ll be analyzed by the media as disappointing because of what they gleaned from analysts like the almost always wrong Piper Jaffray and various other rumor sites. Related to the disappointment, it&amp;#8217;s always dangerous to put too much stock in the Apple rumors sites for a couple of reasons. Apple is known to seed unique prototypes and leak news so they can track it to it&amp;#8217;s source and nuke it from orbit, as it&amp;#8217;s the only way to be sure. This is all a vicious cycle. A new Apple product is rumored to have revolutionary feature X, and when X isn&amp;#8217;t delivered or worse when it&amp;#8217;s revolutionary feature X minus 2, the fans (and sometimes the stock price) goes berserk. I give you the same advice that I&amp;#8217;ve given people for ten years. Go to the rumors sites for fun, but expect the least dramatic feature improvements that you read about. I&amp;#8217;m sure that the rumors reported will all eventually come true and we will see an iPhone 5 and the teardrop shaped phone at some point in the future. Plainly stated, rumors aren&amp;#8217;t always in the current product iteration. If you need a rumored feature X, and have to have it, just wait. It&amp;#8217;ll be released eventually. For now, if you&amp;#8217;re eligible, the iPhone 4s is a great upgrade over your two year old iPhone 3gs in much the same magnitude as the 3gs was a fantastic upgrade over the original iPhone. If you have an iPhone 4, it may not be worth the contract device upgrade fee.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>I have many failings, not the least of which is my inability to learn any other languages other than English fluently. There is a roleplaying game in Poland with no English translation called &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima&lt;/em&gt;, and it sounds like a pretty rich system and setting to play in.  The setting is a post-apocalyptic United States after the machines have killed off most of humanity.  Sure, it has shades of &lt;em&gt;Terminator's&lt;/em&gt; SkyNet, but the fiction diverges from there.  Nature has gone wild, the few remnants of humanity are at each other's throats for scarce resources. An AI Moloch responsible for the initial carnage wants to finish the job.  Firmly set in this universe is the iOS game &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; for the iOS, developed by &lt;a href="http://www.bigdaddyscreations.com/"&gt;Big Daddy's Creations&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Nature has gone wild, the few remnants of humanity are at each other&amp;#8217;s throats for scarce resources. An AI Moloch responsible for the initial carnage wants to finish the job.  Firmly set in this universe is the iOS game &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; for the iOS, developed by &lt;a href="http://www.bigdaddyscreations.com/"&gt;Big Daddy&amp;#8217;s Creations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-294"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Critical to success or failure is your army choice. The starter game priced at $4.99 comes with the mutated cybernetic Borgo, the feudal gang Hegemony, Moloch&amp;#8217;s forces of destruction, and humanity&amp;#8217;s last general standing army The Outpost. There are two in-app $1.99 purchases for additional armies- New York and their police state forces of order, and Neojungle&amp;#8217;s carnivorous plants. Each has their own benefits- New York&amp;#8217;s troops adjacent to the headquarters are extra tough, and the Hegemony&amp;#8217;s adjacent units have extra melee strength to name two. You can either pick your favorite army or let the iOS pick one for you. Your choice. I found success easiest with The Outpost and the Neojungle, but I&amp;#8217;m sure your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_296" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-neuroshima-hex-for-the-ios/attachment/gameplayearly/" rel="attachment wp-att-296"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/gameplayearly-300x200.jpg" alt="" title="Early Game Play" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-296" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blue team deciding where to place tiles, early in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more into the breach we are hit with the simple to learn, difficult to master paradigm. &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; is played on a 19 hex grid, much the same as the original Settlers of Catan is. Each player starts with a tile representing that faction&amp;#8217;s home base. Your goal is the same as up to three other player&amp;#8217;s goals &amp;#8211; destroy the opposition&amp;#8217;s base! Following base placement, the players take turns drawing 3 tiles from their hand and placing 2 of the 3 drawn tiles on the map and selecting which direction they face. Tiles drawn are either unit tiles that represent the various armies in your factions, action titles such as friendly (or hostile!) unit move or start combat, or special effect module tiles like a sniper shot or some sort of combat bonus to attached friendly units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_295" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-neuroshima-hex-for-the-ios/attachment/gameplay/" rel="attachment wp-att-295"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/gameplay-300x199.jpg" alt="Same game, a few turns later." title="A bit later in the game" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-295" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Same game, a few turns later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat has no random element other than the initial draw from the hand. Each combat unit has iconography representing what combat phase they act in (higher is better), what their fields of fire are, whether they have ranged attacks striking distant hexes or just adjacent hexes, and how much damage they do. Modules have similar iconography showing what adjacent hexes they aid, and how, be it a higher initiative number, better or more attacks, or just a one-time healing effect. No rolls, no tables. When the shooting starts by play of a drawn combat tile, individual battles are resolved counting down from whatever tile has the highest initiative. Damage is applied, and tiles are removed as appropriate before progressing to the next lower initiative number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_301" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/?attachment_id=301"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Neuroshima-Hex-Unit-Example-300x198.jpg" alt="Sample unit. Two guns, acts on initiative round 2." title="Neuroshima Hex Unit Example" width="300" height="198" class="size-medium wp-image-301" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sample unit. Two guns, acts on initiative round 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt, &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; is complex for an iOS game. The first few games the game&amp;#8217;s AI kicked my ass soundly until I remembered the oft held maxim to &amp;#8220;do unto others before they do unto you.&amp;#8221; That and paying attention to the module effects as they can stack! If you&amp;#8217;ve got a powerful gunman opposing you and the tile has a module applying an additional action in the next combat phase, as well as another module supplying extra damage, it&amp;#8217;s in your best interest to either destroy the gunman or take out the supporting modules before they can blast away at your forces.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every wargame has some level of math. Some make you break out the rulers, protractors, and other geometric torture instruments. Some don&amp;#8217;t. While the math in &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t complex as wargame math can get, I can see where playing on an iDevice might simplify and speed the game. Unfortunately, this speedup and simplification comes at the expense of player customization. The inherent lack of user expansion is one major gripe I have with the game. However, it seems to be a complaint I have with most computer strategy games particularly on the iOS or other mobile platforms. There are many player-created armies on the internet, and no way to import them. It&amp;#8217;s not hard to learn how to play. The tactical options presented are a bit difficult to get a good handle on. Also, the game doesn&amp;#8217;t make a point on educating players on some of the finer points of tactics other than &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s your units and what they do, now go kill each other.&amp;#8221; This is good or bad, depending on your point of view. For some, the joy of discovery is welcome, for others, not having a tactics primer is a major annoyance. Furthermore, multiple human players are pass and play one one device only.  Good for car rides, not so good when your buddies are scattered all over the internet. &lt;a href="http://www.bigdaddyscreations.com/"&gt;Big Daddy&amp;#8217;s Creations&lt;/a&gt; reports that the next update released before the end of the year will add asynchronous multiplayer, rectifying this gripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; blind assuming it was just an abstract strategy game in the vein of Steve Jackson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Illuminati&lt;/em&gt; just for the iPad. I was ridiculously wrong in my assumption. Not only is &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; based on the large and well supported RPG universe I mentioned earlier, but the tabletop game the app was derived from was published in 2005 and itself has a large player base. This makes for a rich, relatively balanced game environment. So, at $4.99 plus $1.99 for each of two armies, is &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; worth 9 copies of &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;? As tactical games go on the iPad, &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; excels, but to some extent makes the new player suffer for this excellence. How different is that from a tabletop strategy experience, though? A buddy wants you to play his or her favorite game, shows you the basic rules, and then kicks your ass all over the map until you either get frustrated and never play again or figure out some of the tricks to the strategies, rules, and units. If a steep learning curve is a problem, or you&amp;#8217;re looking for a ten minute fix, then don&amp;#8217;t bother. If you&amp;#8217;ve got the time to learn the system or are an existing player of the &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima Hex&lt;/em&gt; tabletop game, then it&amp;#8217;s worth every cent. There is a lite version and unless you&amp;#8217;re a devoted strategy gamer or a &lt;em&gt;Neuroshima&lt;/em&gt; fan I do strongly recommend you try that first, if for no other reason to see if the learning curve is something you can climb without tossing your expensive iDevice out a window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;Base application was provided by the developer for review. The in-app purchases were made by the reviewer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lair of tabletop gaming can be a hard sell to convince people to enter, if you don&amp;#8217;t have a key already. Often large army style games have huge buy ins; expensive metal models, environmental elements, paints and so on. Even though the games look beautiful and overly complex compared to your run of the mill board game, they are just out of reach to routinely play on a normal basis. &lt;em&gt;Warhammer&lt;/em&gt; in any flavor is a prime example of a great game out of reach for most folks. Finding thousands of dollars to build the perfect army is almost going to be as hard as convincing your friends to do the same with their spare cash. However, I think I may have found a good solution to the problem. Not to the generating funds or begging your friends part mind you, but to another avenue to scratch your miniature wargaming itch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-286"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Paint a picture in your mind. It is now almost 200 years into the future. Politics have finally withered to dust to make way for the new ruling classes – corporations. As we’ve suspected all along, they finally made their push for full control of countries making way for mega conglomerates. The world was now divided under the banners of 16 different “MegaCons.” Through bitter battles, economic strategy and corporate sabotage these numbers would eventually ebb, leaving four major players to stand out in the world. The CCC (Eastern North America), KemVar (Central South America), FCC (Southwest Eurasia), and the USCR (Northern Eurasia) floated to the top of the global pool. With these new MegaCons came a new necessity for militarized forces to defend the corporation’s holdings and fight for greater stakes. Enter the Military Economic Reconnaissance Counter Security or &lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt; for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dystopian corporate states combined their police and military forces to create a superior legion in which to fight with in the name of their benefactors. These city-state armies break down into squads. You are the commander of one of these squads. You place your team of five on the field to exert dominance over the opposition. Enhanced by your corporate abilities and armed to the teeth, each side battles it out to the death until one side is left standing over the bodies of their prey. In the name of workplace efficiency about 90 minutes of game time is allowed unless the crushed bodies of your foes litter the ground before then. The key to success is tactics. &lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt; invites you to play at a level of which requires thought and planning to come out the other side of your conflict alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_287" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20sn-review-enter-corporate-war-mercs-tabletop/attachment/mercs-all-you-need/" rel="attachment wp-att-287"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/MERCS-All-You-Need.jpg" alt="MERCS, MERCS Minis, tabletop, wargames, strategy, minis, cards, Warhammer, corporations, war, MegaCons" title="MERCS All You Need" width="576" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-287" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Here is the core of everything you need to play &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;MERCS&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;: Your own set of MegaCon minis and a ton of D10s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re a seasoned veteran of various tabletop battlefields, &lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t brow beat you with a rule book. The rulebook is equal opportunity for the veteran and rookie alike. As you would expect, each unit has unique sets of stats such as movement points, blood (hit points), and armor values among other stats and skills. All of these values are given to you on a non-collectible card for each figure. Each turn breaks into two phases- initiative and action. If you are familiar with D20 ruleset games, initiative shouldn&amp;#8217;t be foreign. Both players roll a D10 (the only die used) for a initiative value for each member of their squad. After each solider has their assigned number, you then proceed to the action phase for each MERC in order from highest to lowest. As you move through each soldier you have the option to move, attack or hold. These actions should be pretty self explanatory. During your turn you call your action and proceed through the steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_290" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20sn-review-enter-corporate-war-mercs-tabletop/attachment/mercs-setup/" rel="attachment wp-att-290"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/MERCS-Setup.jpg" alt="MERCS, MERCS Minis, tabletop, wargames, strategy, minis, cards, Warhammer, corporations, war, MegaCons" title="MERCS Setup" width="384" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-290" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Each unit starts off a card length off of the edge of your playing board. In this case that was just a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you planning to move your MERC, you have to consider the movement points listed on the card. The nice thing about movement is there are cut outs in the cards that you use to measure your movements. No more grabbing the tape measure to see how far you get to go. Do you need to turn a little to accomplish that? You can do that without having to spend a movement point, unless you are turning more than 90 degrees. Does your designated movement spot leave you just shy of the wall you were hoping to get to? You might be in luck if you are within a miniature base from it. The rules specify a nifty ability called “snap to cover” that you can use anytime this occurs. If you chose to do nothing, just declare a hold. How’s that for making things simple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_288" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20sn-review-enter-corporate-war-mercs-tabletop/attachment/mercs-battle/" rel="attachment wp-att-288"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/MERCS-Battle.jpg" alt="MERCS, MERCS Minis, tabletop, wargames, strategy, minis, cards, Warhammer, corporations, war, MegaCons" title="MERCS Battle" width="576" height="384" class="size-full wp-image-288" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the thick of it you&amp;#039;ll quickly start to use up space on your 2&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot; or 3&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot; battlefield. Card decks come with a few terrain cards, but why not make your own too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most games, attacking is a little more complex. Thankfully &lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make it near to impossible and force you to wade through paragraphs of rules to try and get things accomplished. There are numerous things that play into your potential for damage. Things such as range to target, cover and weapon strength play into each chance at a hit. The great thing about it that you aren’t completely depending on the random roll of the dice to see if your strike connects. Instead a predetermined firing number for the weapon you’re using, plus the aforementioned modifiers, gives you a number to aim for with your roll. In essence, you are rolling against yourself. Even if you succeed, just because you hit the opposing forces doesn&amp;#8217;t guarantee damage. Choose the wrong method and end up never piercing armor. Coordinate and pick correctly to deal the real damage. Some abilities have multiple hits that balance out weak weapon damage. However, you can only dole out the pain once per attack that connects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the review the &lt;a href="http://www.mercsminis.com/"&gt;MERCS Minis&lt;/a&gt; folks provided us the CCC and KemVar factions. The faction choice provided showed a good contrast between the MegaCon factions. The Yellow Jackets (CCC) have superior armor capabilities and a medic, while the KemVar have a unique stealth system that always allows them to be at half cover. It makes both sides somewhat difficult to actually hit, especially from a distance. Each MegaCon is designed with specific pros and cons between them. This makes tactics and smart player choices play a huge part in winning a battle. In the case of the sets provided, you could tell that the CCC were meant to stand the test of time, taking punishing damage only to let their armor and medic to the work. As for the KemVar, their cloaking/cover ability made them difficult to him from a distance. For someone to do damage, they’d have to work their way in. The problem with that is that the KemVar soldiers want you to do the work of moving in. With classes like the assassin, their melee abilities reign supreme. Figuring out which corporation suits your play style is a matter of personal opinion, but many options are there. Recently &lt;a href="http://www.mercsminis.com/"&gt;MERCS Minis&lt;/a&gt; added a fifth MegaCon, the Sefadu. A sixth, the Keizai Waza, are also in production slated for an mid-October release giving the prospective &lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt; player two more choices than presented in the &amp;#8220;basic&amp;#8221; set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read on to see how we rank this corporate war game!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Farmer Rick joins the nerds for this slightly longer than average cast. Hailing from the tundra of Minnesota, Rick adds a certain flair to tonight&amp;#8217;s proceedings. Be it the fellowship of a companion home brewer or the brotherhood of the military, he definitely accents this episode. You might think we&amp;#8217;re a little bit of crazy talking about farming on a nerd podcast, but we promise there is method to the madness. Take a listen, if anything it might help you during the zombie apocalypse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recap of this week&amp;#8217;s reviews at 20SON, and why games can be a challenge to review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno discusses his participation in the Diablo III beta.&lt;/li&gt;

                    <description>Over saturation in the shooter market has always been a problem. Again and again publishers churn out scenarios in titles that they think we want, but in reality they are mostly unwelcome rehashes of things we've already seen.

&lt;p&gt;Over saturation in the shooter market has always been a problem. Again and again publishers churn out scenarios in titles that they think we want, but in reality they are mostly unwelcome rehashes of things we&amp;#8217;ve already seen. When yet another World War II-era game was proposed to me, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but to roll my eyes a little. Between all the &lt;em&gt;Medals of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battle of Honors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Callfields&lt;/em&gt; could it be that we&amp;#8217;d be stuck with just another assault on our wallets?

&lt;span id="more-271"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_275" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/shock-and-awe-red-orchestra-2/attachment/red-orchestra-2-running/" rel="attachment wp-att-275"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-275" title="Red Orchestra 2 Running" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Red-Orchestra-2-Running.jpg" alt="Red Orchestra 2, Tripwire, shooter, World War II, German, Russian, realism, multiplayer, tanks, soldiers, PC" width="576" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Running might seem like a trivial thing in games, but keep your eyes peeled. One shot can take you out if you aren&amp;#39;t paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra 2&lt;/em&gt; puts you on the front lines of the World War II conflict. For a change of pace, it places the player on the side not often explored by video game culture- the German/Russian conflict. Single player doesn&amp;#8217;t push you through thick scenarios or pivotal moments that you&amp;#8217;d typically recognize from video game history. &lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra&lt;/em&gt; offers a different path. It pits you at odds against the Axis or Allies forces with an end goal of taking key strategy points to the war. Moving from point to point you push through the dredges holding out for reinforcements in the shattered remains of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it is a different feeling when jumping into playing &lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m not afraid to say this caught me a little by surprise. With every new shooter that comes to market, we assume that everything will be just the same. Basic movements, actions, weapons and so forth. What we never seem to expect is a game that brings an ounce of realism to the table. The scenarios sometimes come to the surface for a brief moment during the campaign, but a moment is generally all we get. Instead in &lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra&lt;/em&gt; we’re faced with a more realistic approach to how things would have been. Instead of bursting into every room guns blazing and jumping around to avoid incoming fire, it is more prudent to pick and choose when to run and gun or when to sit back. Taking hits isn&amp;#8217;t as simple as waiting for your shield to regenerate either. There are actual consequences to taking fire and the adjustment as a player is infuriating sometimes to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaponry plays a huge aid to the realistic feel as well. Firearms don’t have unlimited clips. No round count is on the interface. You aren’t going to fire off 300 rounds a second, then immediately blast them with a phosphorus grenade as a secondary firing method. The only weapons you see are true to the period and act like they should. Being a person with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant"&gt;Mosin Nagant&lt;/a&gt; in their household, I have a profound respect for Tripwire keeping it that way. You want to check and see if you gun is still loaded? You have to actually hold your reload key to see if there are bullets in it. I can truly appreciate the thought put behind that. There were a few times because I wasn’t keeping track of what I fired, a perfect shot was marred by a hollow click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many shooters out there, you have assistance in the form of an army. It creates a different impact on the player, because it will carry on without you. If members of the squadron perish, timers start to when reinforcements will arrive. As long as one solider remains, your army will fight on. A odd side effect comes out via this perpetual replenishment as well. It is possible to win via attrition. Not the soundest of strategies, but it does carry a weight of truth to it as befitting the setting. Both German and Russian leaders disregarded human life in the name of victory. At the end of the war, the resounding number of casualties in the Eastern Conflict reflected this. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it was intentional by the developer to capture that essence, nor should it be taken lightly, but it plays well into the style of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_276" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/shock-and-awe-red-orchestra-2/attachment/red-orchestra-2-tanks/" rel="attachment wp-att-276"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-276" title="Red Orchestra 2 Tanks" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Red-Orchestra-2-Tanks.jpg" alt="Red Orchestra 2, Tripwire, shooter, World War II, German, Russian, realism, multiplayer, tanks, soldiers, PC" width="576" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A tank mode is offered as another multiplayer feature. While it breaks up the trench warfare a little, it doesn&amp;#39;t always seem like it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything is fine and dandy with &lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra 2&lt;/em&gt;. There was something off as I was planning on bouncing from single player to multiplayer. I couldn&amp;#8217;t shake the fact that both offered very similar experiences. I&amp;#8217;ve come to expect an exhilarating, fast paced push through the solo portion from experience playing every other franchise in this overpopulated segment. As short as these other game&amp;#8217;s missions may have been, they were offering at least a difference to playing against others. With &lt;em&gt;Red Orchestra&lt;/em&gt;, other gamers are taking the place of your squad members that in the single-player mode you had an opportunity to command. The overall feel doesn&amp;#8217;t really change from single to multi. Generally speaking the similarity isn&amp;#8217;t a terrible thing, but it almost feels like $10 could have been knocked of the price to make it an online only title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move forward to catch the conclusion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;em&gt;Dead Island&lt;/em&gt; takes place on the fictional island of Banoi, a luxurious paradise where the rich go to relax and party. Recently a mysterious infection has spread throughout the island causing people to die and then rise up as flesh craving undead.  You wake up in your hotel room and immediately feel that something is wrong. As you head outside you see bags strewn about and hear an emergency message playing over the intercom. You make your way to the bottom floor and are ambushed by the infected. From there on you explore the island looking for a way out and helping other survivors along the way. Despite the undead stalking you, should this trip to Banoi be on your itinerary?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Island&lt;/em&gt; takes place on the fictional island of Banoi, a luxurious paradise where the rich go to relax and party. Recently a mysterious infection has spread throughout the island causing people to die and then rise up as flesh craving undead.

Despite the undead stalking you, should this trip to Banoi be on your itinerary?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-269"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you progress throughout the campaign, you have main quests which further the story and side quests. These quests reward you with money, items and experience as is fairly standard for RPG/Shooter hybrids. Many of these quests are simple fetch and deliver quests, which can get repetitive and boring. Fortunately, there&amp;#8217;s always undead adversaries to keep you on your toes while you&amp;#8217;re fetching widgets for somebody&amp;#8217;s snipe hunt. You may also encounter more than just zombies out there. While some of the quests were pretty similar and some seemed tedious to do, the story itself was interesting to experience. Things get more and more complex as you make your way through the island, right up until the finale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start, you don’t have many options when it comes to weapons. Pick up an oar here, a pipe there, nothing really powerful or useful. You’re mainly just looking for something to smash zombies in the skull. As you progress and level up, you gain access to better weapons such as machetes and baseball bats. Furthering your engine of destruction, modifications become available to trick out your weapons with electricity and fire. Nothing is more satisfying than watching a zombie dance around as it is electrocuted to death. You even get access to guns at one point, but don’t get too used to them due to almost Bungie-esque ammo scarcity. This is more of a melee game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zombies themselves are pretty tough as well. As opposed to Left 4 Dead, where you can mow down zombies with an SMG, these zombies can take quite a beating before they go down. Going one on one with a zombie is fairly easy, but watch your back because if you find yourself fighting 5-6 at a time, they’ll take you down faster than you might think. Occasionally you may be walking through the resort, when a zombie grabs you out of nowhere and gives you a close up of its fugly face as it tries to bite you. That caught me off guard on more than one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stamina also plays an important role in this game. You can’t just mindlessly hack away at everything that moves. Eventually you’ll wear yourself down and leave yourself vulnerable to attack. Running and jumping takes out stamina as well, but this usually isn’t a problem unless you’re in the middle of a fight. It was never a huge problem for me, but that said, it did cause my death on more than one occasion as I mowed down zombies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I must mention is the co-op. This game can be fun solo, but can also get pretty boring as well. If you want to really experience this game, you have to play with a friend over xBox live. You can travel together or be up to 700 meters apart taking on different missions. Having more players also ups the number of foes for you to fight, so separating might not be the best course of action. I’m going to quote a tagline for Left 4 Dead, which also works really well here: “It’s the zombie apocalypse. Bring friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controls felt really smooth and natural, from weapon selection to using said weapon and navigation. I loved fighting the tough zombies (though on occasion I wanted to throw my controller at the wall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the graphics. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for Crysis, look elsewhere. This game isn’t too high end in this department. While you have a huge area to play in with few obvious loading areas like the Mass Effect elevators, the graphics still are sub par for this console generation at best. NPC’s all look similar to each other, with little detail and terrible facial expressions. In addition, while loading some areas the detail might take 5-10 seconds to fully load leaving you looking at solid shape buildings and shapes while dealing with the texture pop. This is probably the worst area of the game. I prefer solid gameplay to beautiful graphics so I personally don&amp;#8217;t mind, but if you need epic lens flare and other graphic staples of this generation, this is not the title for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game definitely requires a demo if you don’t pick it up. It’s an enjoyable RPG with plenty of enemies to fight and quests to complete. I easily spent 30+ hours on my first play through completing all the various quests. If you love RPG’s and zombies, you’ll love this game. Dead Island is one of the best games of the 2011 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling item games have come into a bit of a resurgence since the &lt;em&gt;Marble Madness&lt;/em&gt; days with the advent of the iPad and other such motion sensitive devices.

&lt;span id="more-265"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;God Gave Rock and Roll To You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Literally, you have a Sisyphean task to accomplish, considering you&amp;#8217;re actually the eponymous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;. There are boulders to be eternally pushed uphill, and minions harassing you at every turn. After too many pokes in the butt by a minion you get the bright idea to use your massive boulder as a tool for escape- thus begins &lt;em&gt;Rock of Ages&lt;/em&gt;. At the end of a (mildly) torturous path lies Hades&amp;#8217; front door. You have to beat down this front door with your boulder to escape. The first few tutorial levels proceed in similar fashion, adding more game complexities as you go. First, just the gate beatdown. Second, defenses you and your opponent can place to slow your progress. Third, an opposing force boulder intent on beating your own gate and forces down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Wanna Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Upon completion of the tutorial levels, the meat of the game begins. Varied paths, collectibles, enemies, and opposing defenses (as varied as herds of pigs, catapults, and war elephants) wait for you to smash them flat with your boulder. It&amp;#8217;s your choice to smash them and accumulate cash for your own defenses and boulder upgrades, or to avoid them completely. The more damage your own boulder takes on the way down the less of the effect you have on the the enemy&amp;#8217;s gate, so sometimes discretion is the better part of valor. Boss battles break the gate-smashing routine from time to time, but those aren&amp;#8217;t much more than a variant of find and pummel the weak spot, like most games. Multiplayer is exactly the same as the game&amp;#8217;s single-player mode with the welcome addition of split screen play, a rarity these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock You Like a Hurricane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not feeling quite so competitive? Two other game modes await your menu selection- time trials and skeeball. I&amp;#8217;m of a mixed mind about the two. Time trials were an an obvious choice for this game. Less defensive hassle, more speed. Some of the time goals selected for medals seem a bit arbitrary, and depend on just the perfect ricochet or bankshot of your boulder to even come close to competing the track in the allotted time. The Skee-Boulder mode I thought I&amp;#8217;d have the most fun with, but regretfully, not as much as I had hoped. Smashing stuff at your leisure on the way down, or as much leisure as a downhill track can muster, is great fun, but the actual skeeball landing area on the bottom is a bit of a letdown. With enough patience and time, you can jump your boulder into the maximum reward multiplier unless your initial aim is truly, truly terrible. The simple removal of the jump button after a certain point in the level would make this phase of the skeeball mode much more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock Me Amadeus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The graphics and presentation in &lt;em&gt;Rock of Ages&lt;/em&gt; are&amp;#8230;unique. Drawn in a 2D Monty Python adjacent art style, five ages of mankind are presented humorously with nods to pop culture. Spartans want to kick you down a hole, and aren&amp;#8217;t afraid to say so. Bearded wizards announce their determination to stop you from proceeding. You get the idea, I&amp;#8217;m sure. Take it or leave it, Rock of Ages doesn&amp;#8217;t take itself too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock and a Hard Place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rock of Ages&lt;/em&gt; not taking itself too seriously is part of the problem with reviewing the game. The lack of &amp;#8220;balance&amp;#8221; for lack of a better word in the Skee-Boulder mode is an issue. Not not a show stopping one, because more gameplay is better than less. Like other titles boss battles are present, but seem almost incoherent compared to the rest of the game. The graphical style and nods towards pop culture can be viewed as heartily welcome or to be avoided like a poisonous snake. There is both strategy to be had as well as a dose of twitch reflex gaming. If you suck at one or the other, it won&amp;#8217;t break the game for you. &lt;em&gt;Rock of Ages&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t a classic, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be. At press time, &lt;em&gt;Rock of Ages&lt;/em&gt; costs 800 Microsoft points, or $10 on Steam. Whether or not you want to pay full price depends on if light strategy, smashing things with a giant boulder, and a quirky sense of humor all appeal to you. Two out of three? Get it on sale. Only one of the three? Maybe wait for a steep sale. As for this reviewer, I enjoy it, and I think the 800 points is a fair price for an accessible and entertaining game.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Ages have passed since I enjoyed a world construction experience. Perhaps not even since grade school have I even dared to spend slivers of my free time in such a fashion.  It might not be the longest in terms of actual years, but think about the time when &lt;em&gt;Sim City 2000&lt;/em&gt; was a popular game. In sheer terms of computer technology, there an enormous gap of time has passed since then. When &lt;em&gt;Tropico 4&lt;/em&gt; was laid upon me with the promise of a kick back to this bygone age of games, I admittedly looked at it with trepidation. To sweeten the pot, a dash of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; style strategy was promised to give &lt;a href="http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/index.shtml"&gt;Kalypso's&lt;/a&gt; title its own bit of flair. In the end does it leave you with a mellow feeling like a day on the beach, or are you going to be holding your head reeling from too many Caribbean cocktails?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ages have passed since I enjoyed a world construction experience. Perhaps not even since grade school have I even dared to spend slivers of my free time in such a fashion.  It might not be the longest in terms of actual years, but think about the time when &lt;em&gt;Sim City 2000&lt;/em&gt; was a popular game. In sheer terms of computer technology, there an enormous gap of time has passed since then. When &lt;em&gt;Tropico 4&lt;/em&gt; was laid upon me with the promise of a kick back to this bygone age of games, I admittedly looked at it with trepidation. To sweeten the pot, a dash of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; style strategy was promised to give &lt;a href="http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/index.shtml"&gt;Kalypso&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; title its own bit of flair. In the end does it leave you with a mellow feeling like a day on the beach, or are you going to be holding your head reeling from too many Caribbean cocktails?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-254"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Who out there hasn&amp;#8217;t thought of owning their own island in the tropics at one point in their lives? It&amp;#8217;s one of those steps everyone wants to take the day the money comes in. Buy a fancy car, a house, then an island. Why not? &lt;em&gt;Tropico&lt;/em&gt; takes that idea a step further throwing you into the shoes of your own mock dictator. Will you be a kind leader who takes into account the needs of your people? Do you lust for cash, greedily turning your countries profits into your own? Or maybe you want to live harmoniously off the lands and commune with nature? Any of these are a viable solution for you to build upon your own chunk of tropical beauty. Be careful though- just because it is your way doesn&amp;#8217;t always make it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_263" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/my-tropico-4-vacation/attachment/tropico-4-custom-dictator/" rel="attachment wp-att-263"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Tropico-4-Custom-Dictator.jpg" alt="Tropico 4, Kalypso, Sim City, Sandbox, PC, strategy, micromanagement, island, faction balancing" title="Tropico 4 Custom Dictator" width="576" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-263" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Don&amp;#039;t like the look of the beloved El Presidente? Don&amp;#039;t worry! Outside of having a few presets to choose from, you can even create your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first start up &lt;em&gt;Tropico&lt;/em&gt; players can&amp;#8217;t help but notice just how easy it is to play. Take your tried and true formula of building to raise capital, spending money to make money, and balancing just what the population needs won&amp;#8217;t be a foreign concept at all. You build your farms to make food. Housing is built to accommodate your villagers. Basic infrastructure needs are installed like police, government and markets.  What might be new is the idea of variance in the types of buildings and where you can place them. On every generated land, there are prime spots to raise animals on grazing land, better climates for certain plant crops, and even optimal locations for wind generators. Making the best of the plot you were given does play an important role. Food and education are always free. In fact, the basic amenities are almost an afterthought as you play on. With a few corn fields and cattle ranches, the only thing the player has to keep up with is housing. Simple is good, especially for a game that aims to keep you busy through task after task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_264" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/my-tropico-4-vacation/attachment/tropico-4-resource-map/" rel="attachment wp-att-264"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Tropico-4-Resource-Map.jpg" alt="Tropico 4, Kalypso, Sim City, Sandbox, PC, strategy, micromanagement, island, faction balancing" title="Tropico 4 Resource Map" width="576" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-264" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heat maps are offered to the player to indicate things such as resource placement for optimal growth, population density and crime areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great discovery upon loading up &lt;em&gt;Tropico 4&lt;/em&gt;, was the great job Kalypso did in creating a beautiful world for gamers to play in. The graphics for an overhead style builder game are phenomenal. Even when zooming in upon items, you really get a appreciation for how much was put into it. Specific world details were obviously a big project taken on by the studio in an effort to really get into the game. If you wanted to know the name of each worker on a farm, you could. If a specific citizen was unhappy, you could find out exactly why. How many games out there go to the sort of detail of generating feelings and personalities for virtual neighbors? The various advisors are also painted with a caricature style look that makes you want to laugh a little. You&amp;#8217;d think it doesn&amp;#8217;t fit, but it does. The little whimsical look of them adds to just how much the game doesn&amp;#8217;t take itself seriously. It wants to be fun. It wants players to hum along with the authentic feeling music. To Kalypso&amp;#8217;s credit, they pulled this aspect of it off amazingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue on to see just how much of a vacation this is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week, Snorkle from the &lt;a href="http://www.geek-republic.com/"&gt;Geek Republic&lt;/a&gt; joins our weekly revelry. In fine form we cover a few interesting topics, some good, some taboo, some that we have no idea how we got to. I ask you, where else can you hear about Scarlett Johannsen&amp;#8217;s rack, Sesame Street, and Tablet computing on the same podcast?  As a reminder, the explicit tag is set on our podcast!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered, in no particular order, include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The aforementioned rack. Good luck finding the images now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Naked photos on your phone? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Day of the Daleks special edition heaps on the CGI. Is the result better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Portal is free until the 20th of September on Steam. Go forth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Bejewled Blitz can have cognitive value to older gamers. Refrain from making smartass remarks to me, please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Windows 8 is a mobile-looking desktop OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Heavy Rain&amp;#8217;s developers says the used game industry cost them $15 million dollars. Can you guess what we think of this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; HTC says that kids don&amp;#8217;t want iPhones because their parents have one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-YcBVEnLT8" target="_blank"&gt;1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Game soundtracks make you think of chiptunes and ambient music. It isn't often that you run into a full blown original album featuring some of the more unique bands on the scene now. With the announcement of the feature track "Deranged" by &lt;a href="https://www.coheedandcambria.com/us/home"&gt;Coheed &amp;#38; Cambria&lt;/a&gt; my excitement shot through the roof. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/batman-arkham-city-soundtrack-might-be-worth-a-listen/attachment/arkham-city-header/" rel="attachment wp-att-253"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Arkham-City-Header.jpg" alt="Batman, Arkham City, Coheed &amp;amp; Cambria, Deranged, Soundtrack, Music, progressive rock" title="Batman: Arkham City the Album" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-253" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Game soundtracks make you think of chiptunes and ambient music. It isn&amp;#8217;t often that you run into a full blown original album featuring some of the more unique bands on the scene now. With the announcement of the feature track &amp;#8220;Deranged&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href="https://www.coheedandcambria.com/us/home"&gt;Coheed &amp;amp; Cambria&lt;/a&gt; my excitement shot through the roof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-250"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_252" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/batman-arkham-city-soundtrack-might-be-worth-a-listen/attachment/arkham-city-coheed/" rel="attachment wp-att-252"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Arkham-City-Coheed.jpg" alt="Batman, Arkham City, Coheed &amp;amp; Cambria, Deranged, Soundtrack, Music, progressive rock" title="Arkham City Coheed" width="500" height="350" class="size-full wp-image-252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Coheed &amp;#038; Cambria &amp;#8211; left to right Mic Todd (recently removed), Travis Stever, Claudio Sanchez, &amp;#038; Chris Pennie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New ground has been breached by the band in the inclusion of this music accompaniment. Instead of their typical music story telling writing modus operandi revolving around Claudio Sanchez&amp;#8217;s epic science fiction story told musically in each album and in comics, a brand new song outside of that world has been crafted specifically for Arkham City. Sanchez was able to draw deep on the influences of the Batman mythos to create a dark vibe with the epic punch one has come to expect from this prog rock juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/woPliVs5uqM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out October 4th, only two weeks before the game&amp;#8217;s release, this music should go far to get you ready to take on the hordes of villains on the mean streets of Gotham. If you were considering ordering the collector&amp;#8217;s edition, you&amp;#8217;ll be happy to know that a download code will be provided within! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still torn on the album? Check out the track listing below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Panic! At The Disco &amp;#8211; Mercenary&lt;br /&gt;

                    <description>Over the last few decades, there have been a few board games that populate people's closets and toy boxes. In the past, games like &lt;em&gt;Sorry&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monopoly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Game of Life&lt;/em&gt; have been the primary inhabitants of family game shelves. In the last 10 years, there's been a trend toward slightly more complex games carving out a niche, supplementing the old classics. The late 20th century and early 21st century has brought us &lt;em&gt;Carcassone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/em&gt;, and other games labeled with a &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame"&gt;"Eurogame"&lt;/a&gt; moniker. This summer &lt;a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/en/"&gt;Days of Wonder&lt;/a&gt; released their contribution to the Eurogame scene, &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ticket-to-ride/id432504470?mt=8"&gt;for the iPad&lt;/a&gt;. Not everything is well suited to a smudgeware implementation. How easily does &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; adapt to this new iteration of technology?</description>

Over the last few decades, there have been a few board games that populate people&amp;#8217;s closets and toy boxes. In the past, games like &lt;em&gt;Sorry&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monopoly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battleship&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Game of Life&lt;/em&gt; have been the primary inhabitants of family game shelves. In the last 10 years, there&amp;#8217;s been a trend toward slightly more complex games carving out a niche, supplementing the old classics. The late 20th century and early 21st century has brought us &lt;em&gt;Carcassone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/em&gt;, and other games labeled with a &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame"&gt;&amp;#8220;Eurogame&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; moniker. This summer &lt;a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/en/"&gt;Days of Wonder&lt;/a&gt; released their contribution to the Eurogame scene, &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ticket-to-ride/id432504470?mt=8"&gt;for the iPad&lt;/a&gt;. Not everything is well suited to a smudgeware implementation. How easily does &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; adapt to this new iteration of technology?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-244"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_245" style="width: 489px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-ipad-ticket-to-ride-version-1-1/attachment/ttrboard/" rel="attachment wp-att-245"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/ttrboard.png" alt="USA Board for the iPad Ticket to Ride" title="USA Board for the iPad Ticket to Ride" width="479" height="361" class="size-full wp-image-245" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You&amp;#039;ll see this screen a lot.  Keep tabs of your own hand, and basics of everybody else&amp;#039;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; game is widely considered a classic family game after only a very few years of release. It&amp;#8217;s a great example of the oft-repeated marketing line &amp;#8220;easy to learn, difficult to master&amp;#8221; popularized by &lt;em&gt;Mastermind&lt;/em&gt; in the seventies. Summarizing a scant few pages of game manual, &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; subject matter is the railroad rushes of the early 20th century starting with the basic USA map included in the $50 boxed set. A non-collectible card mechanic provides both the random and resource gathering element of the game, leaving the overall strategy of when and where to build tracks to complete route cards completely up to the players.  Up to five players can play.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every player starts with four railroad cars, and up to three route cards.  Each turn, you can either draw a single card from the five visible railroad cars, pick two railroad cards blindly from the deck, build tracks, or pick new route cards.  Picking cards from the deck is self-explanatory.  Each card has a color, or is wild.  Routes between cities are built by having the appropriate number of colored or wild cards to complete the track.  More than one track completed between cities may complete one of your route cards.  Points are scored by completing tracks, the longer the better, and completing routes.  Don&amp;#8217;t pick too many route cards- incomplete route cards at the end of the game count against your score.  Depending on the rule revision you&amp;#8217;re using, either the longest continuous stretch of track or the most route cards completed get a point bonus.  Whichever player accumulates the most points, wins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the iPad, the initial &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; purchase is $6.99. Most iDevice games are priced well below this, but I feel that the cost to benefit equation on this purchase is pretty clear. I&amp;#8217;ll be succinct- The $6.99 initial purchase gives you 100% of the basic &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; set. There are no omissions. Yes, the 1.1 revision fixed a major issue with the game in adding pass and play to the game, which was lacking in the original 1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the $6.99 cost of admission, let&amp;#8217;s to do some quick &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; math. At press time the basic boxed set of &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; costs $35.48. The Europe Expansion costs $40.27, the 1910 expansion runs $16.20, and the out of print Switzerland map expansion is available from one seller for $125. Not even including the collectible Switzerland expansion the basic sets and all the expansions will run you $90. All told, the iPad versions of all these expansions and the basic set cost around $14 total. Buy the entire collection for the iPad and come out at least $75 ahead! I was fortunate. I found my basic meatspace boxed set of &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; at our local super-sized thrift store for not much more than the iPad version of the game. Even though it was at the thrift store, it&amp;#8217;s still important to note that it still cost more than the iPad version!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_247" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-ipad-ticket-to-ride-version-1-1/attachment/onlinettr/" rel="attachment wp-att-247"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/onlinettr.jpg" alt="Online Lobby for Ticket to Ride" title="Online Lobby for Ticket to Ride" width="480" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-247" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gathering your buds for a game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence is passable for a quick game for when you&amp;#8217;re out of range of your internet provider. Where &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; shines is it&amp;#8217;s integration with Days of Wonder&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; online opponent matching service which has been available for the PC and Mac for some time. I&amp;#8217;ve signed onto the service at many times of the day and night over the review period, and there&amp;#8217;s always been somebody available to play. I didn&amp;#8217;t experience any inadvertent (or intentional!) disconnects in my trials. In-game communication is a little rough, with a &amp;#8220;speech bubble&amp;#8221; popping up that&amp;#8217;s often truncated, appears and disappears too quickly, or has an overzealous automatic profanity filter interacting with what&amp;#8217;s said. I&amp;#8217;m 41. I know it&amp;#8217;s hard to enforce online, but I think I can deal with seeing the occasional profanity pop up in this bubble and not be psychologically scarred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_248" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-ipad-ticket-to-ride-version-1-1/attachment/optionsttr/" rel="attachment wp-att-248"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/optionsttr.jpg" alt="Ticket to Ride Expansions" title="Ticket to Ride Expansions" width="480" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-248" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Screen summarizing the expansions you can get for your iPad Ticket To Ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I previously touched on there are many, many more expansions for the &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; tabletop version available. If I have to point out a flaw in this game for the iPad, it&amp;#8217;s that more of these expansions aren&amp;#8217;t available. Specifically &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Europa 1912&lt;/em&gt; expansion, and &lt;em&gt;Alvin and Dexter&lt;/em&gt;. I did ask Christine Goutaland, our contact at Days of Wonder about this specifically. Her response to me was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are always considering upgrades, improvements and add-ons based on demand from our customers. Although it is too early to tell what is coming next, I can tell you that we are working hard and very excited about&#160;our next digital releases!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that the addition of pass to play in revision 1.1 was solely generated by user feedback, and very quickly after release, I&amp;#8217;ll take the quote as very hopeful for future expansion of this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve said this in a &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-logic-factorys-ascendancy-for-the-ios/"&gt;previous review about another strategy title&lt;/a&gt;, but this is not &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;. Quick reflexes play zero part in success or failure at this game. If you&amp;#8217;re a strategy gamer in any aspect be it the occasional game of &lt;em&gt;Stratego&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Risk&lt;/em&gt;, or a more hardcore grognard who delights in &lt;em&gt;D-Day&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Advanced Squad Leader&lt;/em&gt;, I cannot recommend &lt;em&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/em&gt; on the iPad strongly enough. The basic game, and all three available expansions will set you back less than a large pizza, so there&amp;#8217;s no excuse to not hit the &amp;#8220;purchase&amp;#8221; button if you&amp;#8217;re the owner of any generation of iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;*The basic game was provided by the developer for review. The in-app expansions were purchased by the reviewer.&lt;/h5&gt;

                    <description>Episode 30, can you believe it?  No technical issues, no guests, just your two devoted hosts bantering for an hour about the week's news. Does it mean we give you any less of a show? Absolutely not. We just pile on the opinions in such a thick manner that you feel like you're listening to soup. I don't actually recommend trying to listen to soup though. It's a bitch trying to get vegetable chunks out of your ear.  Topics covered this week include twitter misfires by NBC and CBS, the xBox live fall dashboard, cloud service failures, the demise of Good Eats, Ryan Payton's departure, WPIX Channel 11 in the eighties, and a list of the top 50 controversial movies.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Episode 30, can you believe it? No technical issues, no guests, just your two devoted hosts bantering for an hour about the week&amp;#8217;s news. Does it mean we give you any less of a show? Absolutely not. We just pile on the opinions in such a thick manner that you feel like you&amp;#8217;re listening to soup. I don&amp;#8217;t actually recommend trying to listen to soup though. It&amp;#8217;s a bitch trying to get vegetable chunks out of your ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics this week, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; misfires &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5838855/cbs-freaks-out-the-internet-with-steve-jobs-death-tweet "&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/09/09/nbc.twitter.hacked/index.html?hpt=te_bn1"&gt;problems.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aol.com"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; are in the news. What&amp;#8217;s their relevancy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The xBox has a &lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/09/09/xbox-live-fall-dashboard-preview-from-nonsense-to-metro/ "&gt;new dashboard update&lt;/a&gt; coming soon, including live TV!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; cloud now works on the iOS, better or worse than the iCloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the cloud, Office 365 and Google Docs had their own problems this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alas, &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/good-eats"&gt;Good Eats&lt;/a&gt; is no more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did Marcel get a quantum kitchen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan Payton, &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&amp;#8242;s&lt;/em&gt; Narrative Lead quits. Don&amp;#8217;t panic!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game industry is full of -isms. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why and when did kids have to yell &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BkmQ54bYW4"&gt;PIX into the phone?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno addresses this old man, &lt;a href="http://newyork.timeout.com/arts-culture/film/725761/the-50-most-controversial-movies-ever"&gt;and a list of top 50 controversial movies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t going to make their own TV set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you read our &lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Marine&lt;/em&gt; review&lt;/a&gt; yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/attachment/space-marine-header/" rel="attachment wp-att-236"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Space-Marine-Header.jpg" alt="Draeno reviews Warhammer 40K: Space Marine for PC" title="Space Marine Header" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something that always impressed me about Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40k universe. Be it the rich background, the dark, gothic environment or the fantasy of battling aliens for a greater cause, an allure was crafted around it for me. In this gritty world, it just struck me that something had been lacking. It could simply be the fact that I couldn&amp;#8217;t exist in this fictional world, but more likely it was that our perceptions of this galaxy were stifled by the multitude of authors that contributed to it&amp;#8217;s being. It isn&amp;#8217;t to say the writers gave an appalling interpretation, but rather that fans lacked a exciting, tangible experience.  With the induction of Space Marine, THQ made a push to correct this oversight.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div id="attachment_233" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/attachment/space-marine-forge-world-graia/" rel="attachment wp-att-233"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Space-Marine-Forge-World-Graia.jpg" alt="Space Marine Forge World Graia" title="Space Marine Forge World Graia" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-233" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From space we see our intended battle grounds. Impressive Imperium world is it not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this iteration you thrust into an immediate conflict on a forge world. A xenos infestation has endangered a key strategic asset on this factory planet that cannot be lost under any circumstance. Rather than level the planet from orbit, a strike team is ordered to secure it by any means necessary. Who would the Emperor choose to send on this likely suicide mission? None other than a squad of his finest, bravest, elite soldiers &amp;#8211; the Ultramarines. You play the role of Captain Titus. A born blue space marine from the start. You and the squad that follows you are tasked by your God-Emperor to purge the Xenos from the forge world. Together you collect your array of both familiar and new weapons of destruction to stop the Orks from decimating the Imperium factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_235" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/attachment/space-marine-overlooking-destruction/" rel="attachment wp-att-235"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Space-Marine-Overlooking-Destruction.jpg" alt="Space Marine Overlooking Destruction" title="Space Marine Overlooking Destruction" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-235" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nothing can stop an Ultramarine from carrying out his task in the name of the Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space Marine does a fantastic job showing you just what it is like to be the right hand of the Emperor. The sheer brutality that is pressed upon you enlightens you to just what kind of hell an Ultramarine is asked to routinely jump into. It isn&amp;#8217;t enough that the game plays these scenes out for you, but that you play an intricate hand in inflicting it.  Of course it doesn&amp;#8217;t help that the player is encouraged to execute their opponents in bloody, violent ways to bolster their own life to illustrate that. With that excessive maliciousness comes a profound respect for death. It is an honor to be given the life you were by the machine God. To do anything other than return that gift is beyond reason. Captain Titus, our protagonist, makes it a point to remind you. So do the swarms of AI foes that constantly berate you. Orks can be unforgiving as they are endlessly tossed from all directions in an attempt to end your blessed existence. Fortunately, Titus is adept at dispatching the impure through bullet, blast and blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_237" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/space-marine-a-blessing-from-the-machine-god/attachment/space-marine-orc-summoner/" rel="attachment wp-att-237"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Space-Marine-Orc-Summoner.jpg" alt="Space Marine Orc Summoner" title="Space Marine Orc Summoner" width="576" height="324" class="size-full wp-image-237" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Was it mentioned that as a Space Marine you really dislike Orcs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphically the Imperial Forge World Graia is wondrous and deserves praise unto itself. Relic crafted a thing of beauty with the engine that immerses you into the urgency of stopping the onslaught from progressing any further. The industrial atmosphere of the Warhammer universe plays a huge part in that. You spend time looking around every corner, making sure you see the start of the horde encroaching on your position before they find you. Campaign stages are repurposed quite well to develop competitive maps for multiplayer similar to what Halo: ODST and Halo: Reach did. As breath taking as it can be, the world also plays a functional role in balancing firefights when gear gaps can be large. There&amp;#8217;s nothing quite like rocket jumping over a heavy gunner to drop a pile of grenades on his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Carry on to the next page for the conclusion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>First of all, if you&amp;#8217;ve got an iPad go download Crimson Steam Pirates (CSP). I&amp;#8217;ll be here when you come back. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s a genius turn-based strategy game with a luxurious fictional universe built up around it. Yes, the first... &lt;a href="http://20sidesofnerd.com/blog/mini-critique-crimson-steam-pirates/"&gt;Read More &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/mini-critique-crimson-steam-pirates/attachment/csp/" rel="attachment wp-att-230"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/csp.jpg" alt="" title="csp" width="540" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-230" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you&amp;#8217;ve got an iPad go &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crimson-steam-pirates/id438053238?mt=8"&gt;download Crimson Steam Pirates&lt;/a&gt; (CSP).  I&amp;#8217;ll be here when you come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#8217;s a genius turn-based strategy game with a luxurious fictional universe built up around it.  Yes, the first chapters are free, and the additional two sets of 8 chapters will run you all of a dollar each.  What it isn&amp;#8217;t is perfect.  Here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;d like to see in future incarnations of this game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-229"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) A &amp;#8220;Next unit&amp;#8221; button.  Sometimes in the furballs the user interface elements overlap and it can be quite confusing, regardless of zoom level.  A simple &amp;#8220;next unit&amp;#8221; button with a clear indication that you&amp;#8217;ve given all your units new orders for the turn would be very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) Mission and vehicle editor.  CSP is a 2D game with relatively simple gameplay elements.  It&amp;#8217;s ripe for a custom level and unit creation tool.  Sure, it&amp;#8217;s probably got to be a Windows or OSX application, but the iTunes file sharing used in such mundane applications as PDF readers should be sufficient to load a user-created level or unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) More scenarios.  I think the 8 levels that are going to be in each chapter might be a little sparse, given the fiction that&amp;#8217;s been generated already for the universe.  Such things are par for the course in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Weisman"&gt;Jordan Weisman&lt;/a&gt; created universe (think anything by FASA or any given Battletech product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D) More freeform gameplay.  The scenarios are terrific but are stand alone.  Harebraned Schemes, call Firaxis, get the rights to insert your units and fiction in the Pirates-style of gameplay with a semi-persistent world and an overarching plot, rather than just single scenarios.  Build your officer crew as you go depending on who you hire or who&amp;#8217;s loyalty you earn by deeds.  As new labs or technologies are discovered, more equipment can be installed in your steamships!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E) Horde/Firefight mode.  Bring on the baddies until I&amp;#8217;m dead!  No super-deep thought, no plot.  Straight out bad guy blasting.  Let me pick the map, let me pick my starting unit or units, and let&amp;#8217;s rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F) Point based ship construction.  This goes with point E above.  Wargames for years support their combat systems with some sort of checks and balances system. Points, tons, spaces, or what have you to prevent rules lawyers from taking too much advantage of the system.  While an unlimited system in point A is great for scenario designers, this would be a blast to have.  A system in the relatively ancient &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ops:_Warship_Gunner"&gt;Naval Ops: Warship Gunner&lt;/a&gt; is a bit overkill, but something more pen and paper war-game style would be excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t take my requests as serious reasons why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t play Crimson Steam Pirates.  All in all, CSP is one of the more simultaneously deep and accessible iPad strategy games I&amp;#8217;ve played in quite some time.  Even though the external mechanics are simple, the depth of gameplay isn&amp;#8217;t.  A mostly clean user interface allows for precise enough ship handling and efficient bludgeoning of your foes.  What&amp;#8217;s more the first 8 chapters, including multiplayer combat, are free, so there&amp;#8217;s no excuse to not hit download today!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/guest-review-crimson-alliance-xbl/attachment/characters_wallpaper_1920/" rel="attachment wp-att-227"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/characters_wallpaper_1920-1024x576.jpg" alt="" title="characters_wallpaper_1920" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-227" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer has come to a close, the kids are going back to school, and Microsoft’s highly successful xBox Live Summer of Arcade is drawing to an end. The cherry on top of this summer’s onslaught of downloadable games is the aptly titled Crimson Alliance, a title coming from the map pack maestros at Certain Affinity.  Crimson Alliance is free for anyone who bought all 5 other Summer of Arcade titles, and for others, it adopts a unique pricing model in more ways than one. If you want to buy Crimson Alliance, but didn’t buy the other Summer of Arcade titles, you can purchase the game by either paying the full 15$, or, if you only want to play one of the 3 classes, you can shell out 10 bucks instead. The big question is, even at a reduced $10 for one class, is the game worth playing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-225"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crimson Alliance centers on the return of a presumably long-gone sorceress named the Soul Siren, and the quest of 3 (or 4, if you&amp;#8217;re playing co-op with a few more friends) heroes on their way to stop her. It’s a more than adequate plot that does well to push the action in different directions, offering varied locations, new enemies, and tougher challenges throughout. Each character at your disposal has his or her own personality; the wizard is wise, the Assassin is wise cracking, and the Mercenary; levelheaded and deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each character also offers uniquely diverse combat styles. The Wizard is primarily a ranged combatant, the Mercenary a close-quarters brawler, and the Assassin, a mixture of the two.  Playing these classes solo offers everything you’d expect from a hack and slash game. There’s plenty of hidden areas to explore, and some light RPG elements in the form of new gear to be found or purchased, along with some very simple puzzle areas and boss fights.  Solo combat is moderately rewarding, but over time becomes slightly repetitive owing to the lack of any combo system. This never halts the game, but it detracts from some of the more hectic moments of the final levels. This sluggishness is luckily offset with great level design, which offers many hiding spots, and engaging combat areas. In addition, the game boasts some great sandbox items to play around with, such as usable items for damage, distraction, or healing, and lots of destructible items in the environment encourage you to take a break from traditional button mashing by tactically blowing some explosive or corrosive barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the game comes into its own is when you have at least 2 other people playing the other classes. Combat becomes more dynamic with the more varied range of attacks at your party’s disposal, especially considering the absence of combos. There are many hidden areas that are only available to a specific character class, and most of the puzzles in the game require two or more people to complete. At the end of the day, this is a game best played with friends, and luckily, Certain Affinity has made it easy to do, allowing four-player co-op both over Xbox Live (including matchmaking with random strangers) and locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what&amp;#8217;s bound to be a controversial move on xBox Live is the advent of micro transactions.  Vendors will have a large ornate chest, and for the low low price of 80 microsoft points, players can purchase 40,000 in-game gold.  The purchase isn&amp;#8217;t mandatory, but given the knee-jerk reaction of the internet to things it&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning in advance.  The developers at Certain Affinity have thought deeply about this, and I&amp;#8217;ll leave this paragraph with a quote from their development blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;while you can purchase in-game gold to get an early head start on your gear, ultimately the only advantage that this gives you is requiring less time to get better gear. This is due to several things. For starters, you have to unlock merchants in the game, so not everything available to purchase is accessible to someone wanting to advance solely based on buying gold. More importantly, however, buying gold does NOT ultimately give you any advantages over someone who puts in time instead of money. In addition, buying gold does NOT ultimately get you access to all of the best gear in the game; instead some of the very best items are reserved for in-game rewards (hint: find all secret areas and beat all challenge levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crimson Alliance is a wholly entertaining piece of software; it offers something that many Xbox Live Arcade games lack, and it does it at a level of polish that few others attain. I’ve been asked what the game is like by many people. Some asking if it was like Torchlight, others whether it was like Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance, and a few have asked whether it is more akin to Diablo. The truth is, while all these games have common threads, Crimson Alliance stands alone as a unique experience on Xbox Live Arcade. Sitting down with some friends reminded of me of playing Gauntlet many years ago, and this is a testament to the strength of how well the co-op works in the game. For anyone looking for an addictive co-op hack and slash or even someone who is looking for a fun single player campaign without the burden of excessive loot management, then Crimson Alliance is worth your $15 any day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Das Kalk&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Draeno reviews Digital Legend's revenge themed beat 'em up Kroll for iOS devices. Does it live up to this God's expectations? Read on to find out!</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/kroll-banner.jpg" alt="Draeno reviews Kroll for iOS systems." title="kroll banner" width="700" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-222" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been some time since I decided to sacrifice an entire world to the Lesser Gods. I mean, when was the last time that you&amp;#8217;ve seen a good global eradication to show the world who possesses the power? It&amp;#8217;s true &amp;#8211; in my in my profuse free time I am indeed an elder God. At least that&amp;#8217;s what all the voices chanting my name tell me anyway. I rule over the pitiful ants from my tower above doing whatever it is that may amuse me. Regardless, I still find some of their paltry offerings quite appealing. Take for instance the iOS game &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt;. It makes a tiny attempt to bring glory to killing would be creators of the cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-220"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; is a heart-warming tale of vengeance that I can fully appreciate. The character that you play, Delon, is furious. Long ago, all but one Mage-lord was wiped from his world. The solitary survivor was trapped in a rather unique prison, where his body and spirit were stripped apart. Whether true or not, Delon blames the incarcerated Mage-lord Kroll for the death of his loved ones. What did these deaths translate into for our mournful hero? A need to eradicate the final lord, even if it meant the final end of all he knows. Sounds bat shit crazy if you ask me. Silly humans, so impulsive and rash that you never can quite tell where their emotions will take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_221" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/kroll-bashing-the-gods-via-iphone/attachment/kroll-action/" rel="attachment wp-att-221"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Kroll-Action.jpg" alt="Kroll delivers the action!" title="Kroll Action" width="480" height="320" class="size-full wp-image-221" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Boss fights add a nice twist that you wouldn&amp;#039;t otherwise see in a normal brawler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the admirable concept of handheld game, I can&amp;#8217;t help but be entertained by its simplicity. Not since the halcyon age long past of &lt;em&gt;Streets of Rage&lt;/em&gt; on the Genesis has a brawler kept me so enthralled. The controls are simple enough that anyone can pick it up and go without any instruction. On the off chance the rudimentary controls are a little strange for you, &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; was kind enough to offer a FAQ in the title screen. The screens, I may add, are lovely with the quality artwork that was thoughtfully included. To that end, being as cruel as I may be, I chose to play this humble game on an iPhone 3G. &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; ran flawlessly even with it running on version 4.2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brawler is nothing without handheld weapons, and &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; has its own shining cudgel. As you press on and smash things with your mace cunningly ego-named &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Surma&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; it gains in power. (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surma_%28Finnish_mythology%29"&gt;Cunning name, right?&lt;/a&gt;) More power equates to more damage. Those harder hits earned in play are big part in moving forward in some of the dog piles that are thrust upon you. The neat area of effect damage burst comes in handy as well. Shaking the iDevice or tapping the center of the screen yields a tremendous mace slam with damages everything and knocking them back. With these high notes, you can really tell that &lt;a href="http://www.digital-legends.com/index.php"&gt;Digital Legends&lt;/a&gt; tried to bring something new to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_224" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/kroll-bashing-the-gods-via-iphone/attachment/kroll-pileup-starts/" rel="attachment wp-att-224"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Kroll-Pileup-Starts.jpg" alt="Kroll crab pile" title="Kroll Pileup Starts" width="480" height="320" class="size-full wp-image-224" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Here you can see the beginnings of dogpile that you&amp;#039;ll have to smash your way out of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As quaintly entertaining as &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; is, it isn&amp;#8217;t without its flaws. Humans made it, so flaws are to be expected. They can&amp;#8217;t be a perfect as an elder God you know. In some instances you&amp;#8217;ll find yourself overwhelmed by the creatures that for some reason or another are trying to violently persuade you to bring an end to your quest. As much as you bludgeon them, they just continue to hurl themselves at you as their siblings stain the ground beneath your feet. When you stop at certain points along the fixed path that Delon travels, you seem to get stopped in a sort of endless loop of perpetually spawning mace fodder. Not a huge issue, but it can get a tad annoying. Another issue this higher power notices is the light mapping. In some spots you can hardly tell if something is attacking you. Depending on the illumination in your setting, tilting your iDevice will only result in glare that makes it worse. Lastly, the sergeant boss-battles at the end of each sub phase can be a smidge unforgiving. It isn&amp;#8217;t enough for them to hit you, sometimes they have to repeatedly spear you in the gut to get the point across. Even with these minor flaws though, &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt; is an entertaining enough title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_223" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/kroll-bashing-the-gods-via-iphone/attachment/kroll-lighting/" rel="attachment wp-att-223"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Kroll-Lighting.jpg" alt="Kroll lighting issues" title="Kroll Lighting" width="480" height="320" class="size-full wp-image-223" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This stage really shows off the lighting engine issues in the game. Too many objects in the way of the light renders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I choose to spare the lives of these Digital Legends humans that created &lt;em&gt;Kroll&lt;/em&gt;. While they dream fancifully of tearing out the heart of their superiors, I can&amp;#8217;t help but judge their title in a favorable light. There are a few minor complaints that this deity points out, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t hamper the overall enjoyment of the title. I shall spare the smiting for today as Kroll has managed to fill my need for that aforementioned sacrifice. Does that mean I shall spare ye all for your fleeting other attempts to gain my favor? Perhaps. Keep diverting my attention with games like Kroll though and ye may live to see old age.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As always, after a week break some technical nastiness reared it&amp;#8217;s ugly head.  Pro-tip, work out new microphone quirks before you start recording for the night!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, Draeno, Emdee, and Leetum discuss in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/ultima_4"&gt;Ultima IV is free&lt;/a&gt; at Good Old Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; DC&amp;#8217;s titles have relaunched, to mixed reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A Los Angeles casting agency is looking for the &lt;a href="http://kotaku.com/5836996/la-production-company-looking-for-the-king-of-the-nerds-is-that-you"&gt;king of the nerds&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Did you know IO9 reported on &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5836461/10-actual-mistakes-that-syfy-has-made-over-the-years"&gt;10 SyFy mistakes&lt;/a&gt;? Yeah, we noticed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://moconews.net/article/419-streaming-music-is-indeed-coming-to-itunes-with-release-of-icloud/"&gt;Apple iCloud streaming doesn&amp;#8217;t really stream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Steve Jobs is leaving Apple, or is he?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/218918/nasa-vs-apollo-18"&gt;NASA revoked support for Apollo 18&lt;/a&gt;, and some release date confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; How does one deliver pizza to the moon? &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8734456/Dominos-plans-pizza-on-the-Moon.html"&gt;Domino&amp;#8217;s Japan wants to find out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Netflix-Blockbuster-Starz-Entertainment-Video-On-Demand-Dish-Network,news-12402.html"&gt;More bad news for Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sony tablets, reviewed by the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/sonys-new-tablet-s-a-handsome-device-with-software-issues/2011/08/31/gIQA1404sJ_story.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/311509_10150288138072679_99655597678_7509068_6180916_n.jpg"&gt;Two of three of us got to climb on the PAX11 Halo Warthog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Are you a public servant? &lt;a href="http://host.madison.com/news/local/crime_and_courts/c7495b94-d411-11e0-8cd3-001cc4c002e0.html"&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t play pirated movies at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Emdee&amp;#8217;s working on &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/everygame/id370362079?mt=8"&gt;Everygame&lt;/a&gt;, Draeno&amp;#8217;s working on some other stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our regularly scheduled recording times this week!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Draeno gets a hands on demo for the hotly anticipated massively multiplayer online shooter, Firefall by Red 5 Studios. Does it live up to expectations? Did it warrant the massive advertising campaign at PAX Prime? Read on to find out.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-banner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-30121" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-banner.jpg" alt="Firefall by Red 5 Studios" width="700" height="300" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was attending PAX Prime 2010, a true edge of excitement was etched into my brain by a title that touched on everything I&amp;#8217;ve wanted in a massive multiplayer online game. Combining elements of a shooter with not only a huge science fiction world, but also making it free to play out the gate was something that really piqued my interest. The floor demo blew me away as the team playing pushed us through a &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;-esque event. When I heard that finally it would be available for actual play at PAX 11, I knew that this was something I had to get my hands on. Walking into the expo hall, I figured out pretty fast that it would not be too much of an issue for me to find a way to quell my hunger for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/"&gt;Firefall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-206"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_30124" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-PAX-2011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-PAX-2011.jpg" alt="Firefall at PAX 2011" width="450" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-30124" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Red 5 showed off an enormous booth at Penny Arcade Expo Prime 2011 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making my way to their enormous footprint on the show floor for my allotted time, I had the pleasure of meeting David Williams, Lead Class Designer on the project. As he was walking me through the game elements he summed up &lt;em&gt;Firefall&lt;/em&gt; about the best I’ve heard anyone put it. “Think of it as Shooter+++,&amp;#8221; said Williams. You might have been under the impression that Firefall was a typical massive multiplayer game. “Think of &lt;em&gt;Firefall&lt;/em&gt; as a shooter first, but with the holy trinity of MMO elements,&amp;#8221; he put a little more bluntly. &lt;em&gt;Firefall&lt;/em&gt; loads up the three most importa core elements of MMOs; a huge persistent world, advancement, and the social dynamic one has grown to expect. You want a little &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; style instanced content? Yeah, they got that. Perhaps you wanted to roam the vast expanse of Earth and run into dynamic events as you scout? You bet they have that there, too. You like blowing things up with your friends? Come on, you didn’t think they’ve leave that out would you? All the best parts without any of the miserable rat-slaying from the typical persistent online game is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_30122" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-Engineer.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Firefall-Engineer.png" alt="Firefall Engineer" width="500" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-30122" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Guard that turret engineer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point that won me over during the demo was the fact that &lt;em&gt;Firefall&lt;/em&gt; favors skill over power. Unlike most games where you build up experience in alternative methods to power up or raid endlessly to gain gear supremacy over one another, the game is what you make it. If you are better with a certain gearhead battleframe and weapon combination, there is a place for that. Battleframes allow you the luxury of filling out specific roles like medic, assault or recon. Unlike other popular games, one specialization doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to favor over another in situations. Since everything is technology based as well, character skills come and go with what you have equipped. For example, the engineer battleframe I played had a primary weapon that repaired items with its main skill. The secondary bit of it offered a rapid laser blast for offensive power. There are other weapons out there (not just this class) that have different powers, but balance out in the long run. You can deal a massive blast, but aren&amp;#8217;t able to do it fast enough. Don&amp;#8217;t want to stick to one? That&amp;#8217;s fine! You&amp;#8217;ll be able to customize different battleframes all you like without the complexity of most other games out there. In player versus player battles, this will really play a huge part. It didn&amp;#8217;t seem that any class had a huge advantage over another, so you&amp;#8217;ll have to actually learn your given frame rather than game the system. Given the fact that this is a shooter first this play style is true to form, while still having the promise of customization and advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did we cover, you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 12.5 billion dollars nets &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; the Motorola Mobile division.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.stonebrew.com/"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt; Arrogant Bastard Seasonal time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Should you homebrew your own concoctions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What&amp;#8217;s Emdee&amp;#8217;s secret crafty shame?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; HP WebOS is dead, and so is the HP computer division, most likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We hate fanboys, and why you should too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Why is it exactly that video games aren&amp;#8217;t getting finished by players?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Who said that the &amp;#8220;PC is a discrete gaming platform&amp;#8221;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;Time Crisis&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What&amp;#8217;s Ridley Scott doing with &lt;em&gt;Bladerunner&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; wants to fight &lt;a href="http://bethsoft.com/eng/index.php"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Quake 3&lt;/em&gt; over the word &amp;#8220;Scroll.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Pre-PAX podcast schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Last but not least, going to PAX?  SHOWER.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime="2011-08-28T17:58:29+00:00"&gt;Recording a bit earlier this week, pre-PAX.  Look for the next episode a bit earlier next week!&lt;/del&gt; Yeah, this didn&amp;#8217;t happen.  More info to come!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to my advanced gaming age, my generation of games is primarily from the 1990s.  Unfortunately, without jumping through some hoops it&amp;#8217;s a little challenging to get games designed for sub-gigahertz machines functioning on today&amp;#8217;s multicore speed demons.  Personally, I think there&amp;#8217;s an obvious platform for some of these classics- your tablet of choice.  Here&amp;#8217;s a list of 10 games I think would make an obvious migration to smudgeware platforms, be it the &lt;em&gt;iOS&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Android&lt;/em&gt;.  Games are presented in no particular order, and were selected based on my own fond memories with a mind towards a touchscreen interface being suitable for optimal game control.  Games parsers such as &lt;em&gt;SCUMM&lt;/em&gt; or classic console emulators available on &lt;em&gt;Cydia&lt;/em&gt; or other similar channels are regretfully not included in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-190"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/civ2/" rel="attachment wp-att-191"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/civ2-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Civilization 2 In Action" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-191" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
10) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_II"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civilization II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:  An early touchscreen game was &lt;em&gt;Civilization: Revolution&lt;/em&gt;.  While a good game in it&amp;#8217;s own right, I don&amp;#8217;t think that it&amp;#8217;s truly a Civilization game in anything more than name.  &lt;em&gt;Civilization II&lt;/em&gt; ran on a 386 and had a remarkably simple interface as compared to later entries in the series.  A graphical makeover is all it needs, as it&amp;#8217;s had years and years of balancing!  &lt;em&gt;Civilization II&lt;/em&gt; remains firmly in the hands of &lt;a href="http://www.firaxis.com/"&gt;Firaxis&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/fallout/" rel="attachment wp-att-192"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/fallout-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Fallout Violence" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-192" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
9) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icewind_Dale_(series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_(series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;#8217;s Gate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  All three were published by a division of Interplay known as Black Isle, and all three use a very similar game engine for their presentation.  In an era of full motion video, these three games minimized that and used the resources otherwise filled by FMV for rich, expansive worlds.  Key commands could be used as shortcuts, sure, but the game could be completely played using only the mouse.  I don&amp;#8217;t foresee any of the three hitting the tablet scene- Bethesda currently has a stranglehold on Fallout.  Titus Interactive briefly owned Interplay, and as such, the intellectual property rights to &lt;em&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;#8217;s Gate&lt;/em&gt;.  Titus shut down Black Isle, before itself folding releasing Interplay from the shackles of ownership, leaving the rights to &lt;em&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baldur&amp;#8217;s Gate&lt;/em&gt; somewhat up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/starfleetbattles/" rel="attachment wp-att-198"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Starfleetbattles-300x229.jpg" alt="" title="Star Fleet Battles Formation" width="300" height="229" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-198" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
8) &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; While as a pen and paper grognard from way back, I&amp;#8217;d love to see a full-on implementation of &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; or it&amp;#8217;s simpler cousin &lt;em&gt;Federation Commander&lt;/em&gt;.  I honestly don&amp;#8217;t see the &lt;a href="http://www.starfleetgames.com/"&gt;Amarillo Design Bureau&lt;/a&gt;  allowing it to happen.   Once upon a time &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taldren,_Inc."&gt;Taldren&lt;/a&gt; released the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet_Command_(game)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfleet Command&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series loosely based on the &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; ruleset, with the best title of the series being &lt;em&gt;Starfleet Command II &amp;#8211; Orion Pirates&lt;/em&gt;.  Taldren&amp;#8217;s game eschewed the turn-based nature of the source material and went more towards a real-time strategy title, albeit with a time progression slider to accelerate or decelerate the pace of the action.  &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; purists may chafe a bit at the &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; universe, as it has limited rights to the Trek universe source material. A &lt;em&gt;Star Fleet Battles&lt;/em&gt; game universe isn&amp;#8217;t an optimal solution for the Trek purist, but what is?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/masteroforion2_1/" rel="attachment wp-att-200"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/MasterOfOrion2_1-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Master of Orion 2" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
7) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master of Orion II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; : While there are a couple of excellent 4x space games on the Apple Appstore, probably the longest lived one is &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion II&lt;/em&gt;.  Developed by Simtex and Published by Microprose in 1996, it won the Origins Award for best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer game of 1996.  Once again, I&amp;#8217;ve included it in this list for the predominantly mouse-based interface of the original as well as the depth and quality of the gameplay.  On this list, I&amp;#8217;ve probably got the most time spent on this game over any others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/myth002/" rel="attachment wp-att-195"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/myth002-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Myth 2 Smear, Likely Caused by Dwarves" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-195" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_II"&gt;Myth II&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;#8211; Pre-&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, Bungie had a couple of other games.  &lt;em&gt;Marathon&lt;/em&gt; hit the iOS store this year, and the other most notable series in the Bungie catalog is &lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt; series rewards tactical thinking over mass production- in fact, there&amp;#8217;s no production mechanic.  You go to war with what you have.  Keyboard commands were somewhat limited, so any user interface modification needed would be similarly limited.  Remember, be careful with the Dwarf grenade tossers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/populous/" rel="attachment wp-att-196"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/populous-300x192.jpg" alt="" title="Go forth and conquer, minions!" width="300" height="192" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-196" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powermonger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Bullfrog was an early powerhouse in video game development.  In fact, &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; is considered the first PC god-game.  Simply stated, &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the role of a tribe&amp;#8217;s deity, responsible for leading your followers to victory over an opposing god by direct manipulation, terraforming, and straight-out divine intervention.  &lt;em&gt;Powermonger&lt;/em&gt;, also developed by Bullfrog, took a more combat-oriented approach to the genre, with less god-like intervention.  Both games were in the early days of mouse-based control, but the simple utility and clean interface of both lend themselves easily to tablet controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/robosport2/" rel="attachment wp-att-197"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Robosport2-287x300.jpg" alt="" title="Robosport Box Art" width="287" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-197" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboSport"&gt;Maxis &lt;em&gt;Robosport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211;  Maxis is better known for it&amp;#8217;s assorted Sims series than &lt;em&gt;Robosport&lt;/em&gt;.  If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a quick and dirty squad-based four on four robot carnage game, then look no further.  Tragically, it&amp;#8217;s nearly impossible these days to get it to run on anything more modern than Windows 98 or OS 7.5 on the Macintosh.  A straightforward movement pre-plotting phase really demands the players execute with good tactics, rather than just superior firepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/mechommand/" rel="attachment wp-att-194"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/mechommand-300x246.jpg" alt="" title="Mech Commander Lance" width="300" height="246" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-194" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mech_commander"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mech Commander&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  While FASA released an awful lot of products during their lifetime, their &lt;em&gt;Battletech&lt;/em&gt; property was probably the best known.  One of the offshoots of the universe was the &lt;em&gt;Mech Commander&lt;/em&gt; series.  &lt;em&gt;Mech Commander 2&lt;/em&gt; was released to retail in 2001, and the source code was released in 2006 for use with the XNA platform and compilers provided by Microsoft.  Rather than the cockpit view of &lt;em&gt;Mechwarrior&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mech Commander&lt;/em&gt; places you in charge of a lance of mechs and assorted other units in either defense of an objective, a periodic escort mission, or an all out assault on an enemy objective.  It seems the most likely for this to see the light of day on a future Windows tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/harpoon/" rel="attachment wp-att-193"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/harpoon-300x225.gif" alt="" title="Harpoon, In all it&amp;#039;s graphical glory" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-193" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon_(video_game)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harpoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; The &lt;em&gt;Harpoon&lt;/em&gt; miniatures war-game by Larry Bond was released in 1980 and was an amazingly complex game.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t until the computer version was released by Three-Sixty in 1989 that the game took off in circles other than official Navy ones.   The game is completely based on statistics and performance of real world vessels and units, so as such, there is no inherent balance or gamesmanship possible straight out of the box.  The game is currently available on the PC and Macintosh by Advanced Gaming Systems (http://www.computerharpoon.com/), but a tablet version would be a welcome addition and help educate the public on the true complexity of modern naval warfare.   Of all these games, &lt;em&gt;Harpoon&lt;/em&gt; is the likeliest to suffer from a slow tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/top-10-games-that-should-get-the-tablet-treatment/attachment/warhammer/" rel="attachment wp-att-199"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Warhammer-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="About a $10,000 Warhammer Army" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-199" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1) &lt;a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warhammer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Any &lt;em&gt;Warhammer&lt;/em&gt; game universe is an obvious addition to a tablet.  A basic set can be implemented with two or three armies or factions, then additional supplements can support the base purchase with an in-app purchase.  While this is probably the one franchise I&amp;#8217;d love to see happen the most, it&amp;#8217;s also categorized as &amp;#8220;a snowball&amp;#8217;s chance in hell&amp;#8221; of happening.  While other tabletop games might have rights limitations or be hard to adapt for a touch screen, Warhammer in any incarnation doesn&amp;#8217;t have either of these problems. However, it does present its own unique problem &amp;#8211; a set of overzealous guardians.  THQ guards the computer rights, and has yet to make a faithful adaptation of the &lt;em&gt;Warhammer&lt;/em&gt; rulesets.  In the physical world. Games Workshop zealously guards the miniatures aspect. That’s probably the rub here- there’s a lot of money to be made with miniatures. If a computer counterpart were to be introduced, that market would start to see an erosion that tore away at the foundation of their profits.  Besides, I fear an ecosystem with unique single-redemption codes printed on each miniature, requiring you to buy the miniature out here in meatspace and enter the code to use in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are loads more that could be included on this list.  The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Box"&gt;AD+D Gold Box adventures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM:_UFO_Defense"&gt;&lt;em&gt;X-Com UFO Defense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or many miniatures games from the past in the vein of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Car Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogre_(game)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ogre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.sjgames.com/"&gt;Steve Jackson Games&lt;/a&gt;.  To this I ask- why are there so many soundbox or copycat applications?  I fear that with all the acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies, many of the licenses to a large number of classic great games are lost to the mists of time.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Long ago, when computer clock speed was measured in double and sometimes triple digits, a deep game experience had to utilize the chestnut of wargaming- a turn based game mechanic. Before you roll your eyes, there's nothing wrong with turn based games. Classics like the entire &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; series and the original &lt;em&gt;X-Com&lt;/em&gt; games use turn based play to great effect and have earned longevity in the marketplace. A hair over a decade into the 21st century there are not that many turn based games left. Back in 1995, Broderbund and a host of others, published the original version of &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; for DOS. Earlier this year, it was re-released for the iOS by the &lt;a href="http://www.logicfactory.com/main/Logic_Factory.html"&gt;Logic Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Is there a place for a hardcore turn based strategy game on the iDevice of your choice?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-185"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; is at it&amp;#8217;s heart a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X"&gt;4x game&lt;/a&gt; set in deep space, much like the more well known &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; series. Pick your people well, as your particular path to galaxy domination should be lead by your race&amp;#8217;s particular strong points. Ignore your weakness at your own peril! As always with this genre after race selection, you start small with one tiny outpost and your tendrils of weak exploration units reach out to other star systems to look for resources to build your empire, and ultimately, the bad guys. Science is developed over time, colonies are built up into mega worlds, star ships are designed and built, diplomacy is hashed out, and almost inevitably wars are declared. How and where you explore, attack, and build is completely up to the player, and the galaxy is random each time you start a new game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a veteran of the 4x type of game.  I&amp;#8217;ve got many hours logged in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion II&lt;/em&gt; and a few others.  I didn&amp;#8217;t play Ascendancy the first time around, though.  I thought I&amp;#8217;d jump right in with my normal first game tactic- total military oppression of the enemy.  To this end, I picked the Snovemdomas, known for their double strength hulls.  Using my standard overwhelming force buildup, Zerg-rushesque in it&amp;#8217;s lack of subtilely, I thought I&amp;#8217;d have the normal successes that I had in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;.  In theory, I&amp;#8217;d have massive losses, but military gains worth the losses.  I hadn&amp;#8217;t considered that the first race I&amp;#8217;d run into was a race of extreme scientists, and they drove me off and followed me back to my home planet to finish the task.  So, following a restart, I picked the same tactic, and managed to pound the Oculons into the dirt.  Same race, same tactic, but the galaxy&amp;#8217;s randomness was the determining factor between my success and failure.  The first play through took about three hours, the second much longer before total victory.  I did try other methods, and while valid for victory, for me nothing is quite as satisfying as driving the enemy before me, and hearing the lamentation of their mating pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_189" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/20son-review-logic-factorys-ascendancy-for-the-ios/attachment/ascendancyplay/" rel="attachment wp-att-189"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/ascendancyplay-200x300.jpg" alt="" title="A typical Ascendancy Play Screen" width="200" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-189" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A typical Ascendancy Play Screen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a key point to this review &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; is originally from 1995 and it shows. Games were different then and these differences are accentuated in the modern port of the game. The interface is sometimes obtuse but no more difficult than the original. The graphics are primarily simple and representational, but again no more so than the original. In a world of &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;, 3d shooter engines, and retina displays some gamers will be turned off by the intentional retro look, feel, and play of the game. This is not a &amp;#8220;5 minutes on the subway&amp;#8221; kind of game as most of the iOS games trend towards. Rather, &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; is a &amp;#8220;4 hours on the sofa during a Red Sox-Yankees game&amp;#8221; experience. There&amp;#8217;s no penalty for an ill-timed interface action like there would be in an action game. Play the game, look up, watch the play, look back down, play more &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20SON&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; Verdict? &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; caters to a particular breed of strategy gamer who is perhaps disenchanted by the prevailing crop of flick and forget iOS games. That said, &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t for everybody. If you&amp;#8217;re turned off by retro gameplay and interfaces, maybe you should look at &lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/em&gt; instead. In my opinion, there is no deeper strategic experience than &lt;em&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/em&gt; to be had on the iOS for your gaming dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>This week's action packed episode of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast comes to you fresh off the presses. No hops-based social lubrication this week, so we're a bit crabbier than normal.

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s action packed episode of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast comes to you fresh off the presses. No hops-based social lubrication this week, so we&amp;#8217;re a bit crabbier than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics this week include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt; is renewed, then cancelled. Fret not, lots of episodes remain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we think &lt;em&gt;Alphas&lt;/em&gt; is going to survive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;- still good or treading water?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://penny-arcade.com" target="_blank"&gt;Penny-arcade.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pvponline.com" target="_blank"&gt;PVPonline&lt;/a&gt; release &lt;a href="http://trenchescomic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trenches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new webcomic based on the video game testing &amp;#8220;industry&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johnathan&amp;#8217;s card shut down. Actual social experiment or viral marketing gone crazy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning on buying &lt;a href="http://rage.com/gate/?return=%2F" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used? Don&amp;#8217;t count on using the sewers to get around. How long will we put up with publishers squeezing the second hand game market for more dough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post office wants to lay off 120,000 people, and planning some &amp;#8220;manifest destiny&amp;#8221; crap for solutions in small towns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valve announces a new &lt;em&gt;Counter Strike&lt;/em&gt;, with a new hat trading mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox 6&lt;/em&gt; released today, but &lt;em&gt;Firefox 8&lt;/em&gt; will block auto-toolbar installers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want a thorium powered car? So do we, but we don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ll ever see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falling Skies&lt;/em&gt; season 1 is over. Is it worth watching, or more of the same crap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno reviews &lt;a href="http://www.mercsminis.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mercs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go buy it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>On this edition of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast, Emdee and Draeno bring you some random happenings in the geek world that have come out of GenCon as well as am update to some things we've touched on before. We promise, you're not stepping back in time hearing some things again. Unlike some other crazy folks out there, we don't dabble in nuclear power. We leave that to those with disposable income and the need for a dangerous "hobby."  Topics covered include Margaret Weis' Marvel license, Villains and Vigilantes, Fantasy Flight's Star Wars license, the Cenarion Hatchlinbg pet, OSX Lion experience update, and gravestone QR codes.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On this edition of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast, Emdee and Draeno bring you some random happenings in the geek world that have come out of GenCon as well as an update to some things we&amp;#8217;ve touched on before. We promise, you&amp;#8217;re not stepping back in time hearing some things again. Unlike some other crazy folks out there, we don&amp;#8217;t dabble in nuclear power. We leave that to those with disposable income and the need for a dangerous &amp;#8220;hobby.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics for this week include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.margaretweis.com/"&gt;Margaret Weis Productions&lt;/a&gt; is granted the &lt;a href="http://www.marvel.com"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; license for 14 RPG books. First book will be out next year based on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_%28comics%29"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; saga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://monkeyhousegames.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Villains and Vigilantes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks towards a rebirth by the original developers. Defunct publisher says &amp;#8220;Woah, there buddy.&amp;#8221; Lawsuit ensues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/index.asp"&gt;Fantasy Flight Games&lt;/a&gt; is getting the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; license. Look forward to more card games and collectable games like &lt;em&gt;X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blizzard.com"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; lets the bomb drop about requiring an internet connection for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.diablo3.com/"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the new real cash market place. Rage erupts over the internet from people that will still buy the game anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cenarion Hatchling pet for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; raises $2 million for Japan relief. However, they lost 300,000 subscriptions between May and July. Look forward to buying more things and burning through content even faster until &lt;em&gt;Titan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee updates his experiences with OS &lt;em&gt;Lion&lt;/em&gt;. USB stick with the OS on it will be arriving soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A study from Copenhagen Business School and the University of Waterloo say that better rated games are pirated more. No shit. If people are going to steal, why would they steal something they know is terrible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News surfaces that Mars may have water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QR codes are now available on gravestones. Connect with people on your Facebook page from beyond the grave!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man tries to build nuclear reactor at home. Hobbies are fine, but really this is just plain crazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Capps, President of &lt;a href="www.epicgames.com"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, ponders the point of next generation consoles when we have powerful mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get lost a little on shopping for furniture at &lt;a href="http://www.ikea.com/"&gt;Ikea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbolt vs. USB 3 &amp;#8211; Both are good. No reason to be upset. Eventually both will be an option on PCs and Macs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>On this edition of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast, Emdee and Draeno bring you some random happenings in the geek world that have come out of GenCon as well as am update to some things we've touched on before. We promise, you're not stepping back in time hearing some things again. Unlike some other crazy folks out there, we don't dabble in nuclear power. We leave that to those with disposable income and the need for a dangerous "hobby."  Topics covered include Margaret Weis' Marvel license, Villains and Vigilantes, Fantasy Flight's Star Wars license, the Cenarion Hatchlinbg pet, OSX Lion experience update, and gravestone QR codes.</itunes:summary>

&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stream to Me on the iOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve been Apple junkies for years, regardless of the effect it has sometimes on the wallet.  All told, the tech has been pretty good to me. I’m sure I’ve made more money supporting it out in town than it’s cost me overall.  My inner cheapness prevents me from buying the whammerdyne max-capacity iPhones.  Staying on top of the curve isn&amp;#8217;t so cost effective and we often make do with old tech long after the rest of the tech enthusiast world has moved on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-176"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our video library is hosted on an older machine crammed full of relatively ancient hard drives, honestly, well in excess of what the laws of physics and heat dissipation should allow.  I’m fairly sure I can cook a turkey with the waste heat coming off that machine.  Because of the stone-soup nature of the server and the capacity it holds these days, the DVD rips we store on iTunes for the AppleTVs in the house far exceed the capacity of any given portable iDevice we may have in service.  Apple has made great strides in streaming to iDevices with AirPlay technology, but there are still some glaring omissions, namely in non-Jobs blessed containers and codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research, tried some free alternatives, then I found &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://projectswithlove.com/streamtome/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt;, by Matt Gallagher’s Projects With Love&lt;/a&gt; is a combination server application for your OSX Mac or Windows PC that holds the media, and either an &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/streamtome/id325327899?mt=8" target="_blank"&gt;app for your iDevice&lt;/a&gt; (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) or &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/streamtome/id405892506?mt=12" target="_blank"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; for playback.  The PC or Mac server application is free for download- it’s the iDevice app that will inexpensively impact your wallet for the princely sum of $2.99.  At press time, the Macintosh playback client for the &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt; pair is free.  Even given my limited budget, I splurged for the iOS app some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I originally purchased &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt;, Apple integrated a similar technology in iOS 4- they call it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay" target="_blank"&gt;AirPlay&lt;/a&gt;.  Airplay is a revision of a proprietary &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; that Apple would like more widely integrated in digital receivers and the like.  For now, it&amp;#8217;s primarily limited to Apple-friendly containers, like MP4 and M4V with an H.264 encoded video.  &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt; extends that utility as well as reverses the direction- instead of sending a video from an iDevice to another device, Stream to Me sends from a common server to an iDevice on the network or across the internet, router and ISP depending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt; is an amazing, seamless after initial setup solution for streaming entire libraries over 802.11g (or faster) or 3g networks to an iDevice regardless of video format container.  The server application runs quietly and with very little resource footprint on our overtaxed media warehouse computer running OSX Leopard.  The server part of the application pair has transcoded on the fly many different containers.  I’ve fed the server MP4 H.264, AVI, and MKV files, all in 720p resolution and streamed them to the iPhone/iPad application with minimal pre-processing delay and no hiccuping in the video waiting for the 802.11g stream to catch up.  Of course, the pre-transcoding time may vary depending on the ferocity of the iron that you host the content.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR?  Looking for a way to stream all those miscellaneously formatted videos you&amp;#8217;ve acquired in your travels across the wilds of the internet without time consuming and processor slamming lengthy transcoding processes?  I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Stream to Me&lt;/em&gt; as your one stop shop for universal video streaming and viewing for both your iOS device as well as your OSX based machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stream to Me was purchased by the reviewer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In what seems like a millennia ago, I spent the majority of my time in a business of antiquated venture called a video rental store. Between helping people with their rentals, I would run across some films of questionable worth as I totaled them out. When you work in any sort of movie retail market you learn that with every big movie release comes a wave of lesser known films trying to cash in on the subject matter. Movies lined the walls ranging from the big titles you see in theaters to ones that someone filmed with too much red-tinted Karo syrup and a handy cam. Often I find myself thinking back to those days when I see an indie game that piques my interest.  There just always seems to be something that makes you want to chance the terrible to find an unknown gem. &lt;em&gt;Hydrophobia: Prophecy&lt;/em&gt; was one of those games that I hoped to pull from the middle of the road to obscurity and be bathed in unexpected wonder.</description>

&lt;p&gt;In what seems like a millennia ago, I spent the majority of my time in a business of antiquated venture called a video rental store. Between helping people with their rentals, I would run across some films of questionable worth as I totaled them out. When you work in any sort of movie retail market you learn that with every big movie release comes a wave of lesser known films trying to cash in on the subject matter.

&lt;span id="more-168"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_175" style="width: 874px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/hydrophobia-prophecy-fails-to-make-waves/attachment/hydrophobia-queen/" rel="attachment wp-att-175"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Hydrophobia-Queen.jpg" alt="The view from Kate&amp;#039;s apartment aboard the Queen of the Ocean." title="Hydrophobia-Queen" width="864" height="540" class="size-full wp-image-175" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The view from Kate&amp;#039;s apartment aboard the Queen of the Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place yourself in the not too distant future.  At first sight, everything seems to be well in the world. That is of course until you unravel the lie you&amp;#8217;ve been shown to uncover the true fate of humanity. Earth is actually in a state of disarray due to an overwhelming population growth. While things around the planet fall apart corporate kingpins use their wealth to stash themselves away on a floating utopia, avoiding the global catastrophe. Aboard this vessel, this &lt;em&gt;Queen of the Ocean&lt;/em&gt;, you take on the role of Kate Wilson- a security engineer whose accomplishments have been buried by a tragic event in her past. You wake from a terrible dream to find that during the 10th anniversary of the vessel, things are mysteriously fading. Being the model employee Kate is, it is decided (on her day off no less) that she is going to take a look into it. As soon as she steps into the elevator things begin to go to hell. Explosions rock the ship and cascades of water begin to pour from every imaginable port, tear, and breach. Enter a terrorist group known as the Malthusians who envision saving the world through the mass slaughter of humankind. Hoping to make a statement, they hone in on the &lt;em&gt;Queen of the World&lt;/em&gt; looking to destroy those who have been spared the suffering of the rest of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_171" style="width: 874px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/hydrophobia-prophecy-fails-to-make-waves/attachment/hydrophobia-enemy/" rel="attachment wp-att-171"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Hydrophobia-Enemy.jpg" alt="The face of the Malthusians causing terror on the Queen." title="Hydrophobia-Enemy" width="864" height="540" class="size-full wp-image-171" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The face of the Malthusians causing terror on the Queen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like that should be the basis of a pretty good story right? Sadly, it really isn&amp;#8217;t. It might as well be a plot for a bad Billy Zane or Jean Claude Van Damme film. The potential for &lt;em&gt;Bioshock&lt;/em&gt;-esque thrill is there, but as the plot line evolves it all falls flat. Even though &lt;a href="http://www.darkenergydigital.net/index.php"&gt;Dark Energy&lt;/a&gt; fixed a majority of the plot for &lt;em&gt;Prophecy&lt;/em&gt;, it is still desperately lacking. The main problem is that you have no reason to care about Kate or anyone else aboard the magnificent city barge. There is a short glance into the troubled past of our protagonist, but that&amp;#8217;s all it is &amp;#8211; merely a short look. Picking through the relics of her former life in her apartment, we get a feeling that she was an accomplished swimmer. However, at some point a tragedy had befallen her ambitions. We&amp;#8217;re left with only the dream sequence at the start, the mysterious haunting laughter and almost entirely missed utterance of a name let you know. With only superficial evidence of a greater meaning to the arc of the game, it is no wonder that one would have issues caring about anything going on. Your next best sliver of empathy would come into play with the residents of the ship. Really though, while any loss of life isn&amp;#8217;t something to smirk at, how long can you feel for a group of people that ran out on the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the flat characters and overall lack of story, there are some annoyances that are hard to move past. The controls can be a bit awkward at times. Once you become altered to commune with water, you ultimately have a choice. You can use water to ultimately try to drown everything or continue shooting through the rest of the game. Using both tends to be a problem as you can no longer aim at what you want to shoot. All shots end up being a blind fire towards the vicinity of whatever the water is bobbling at the time. Not enough of a headache? Try picking up an object while swimming then activating the water powers. Oh? You don&amp;#8217;t like camera lock in unplayable angles? Never mind then. It can&amp;#8217;t be put past anyone that this may have been a side effect of porting from a console game. As a distraction a point system was put into place. Kate&amp;#8217;s side goal becomes collecting points by finding objects and documents objects to gain medals and to add to your overall score. Why? There is no purpose to it other than to bolster your bragging rights to your friends (&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; they purchased the game). Sure you can become incentivized to kill villains in more creative way to rack up the total some more, but even that becomes stale. AI in this game is far from challenging or dynamic.  Compounding the AI problem, the so called variety of deaths, isn&amp;#8217;t very varied. Add the aforementioned aiming and locking issues and things can get a tad frustrating when trying to execute the kills. It leaves one to wonder why did they have to do so many re-workings and additions of levels to the game when these facets of &lt;em&gt;Hydrophobia&lt;/em&gt; should have resolved first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the conclusion on the next page!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

No censors this week as everyone involved has no problems speaking their minds. Due to this, the explicit tag is implied with force. F-bombs just kept falling!  Topics discussed include Fox's programming paywall, Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, the Humble Indie Bundle 3, the Stormtrooper armor's designer's legal woes, the 3DS price drop, RIM layoffs, and more.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a rather casual atmosphere this week, Emdee and Draeno welcome back Mr. Meyagi of the &lt;a href="http://www.spiritsoffire.com/"&gt;Spirits of Fire&lt;/a&gt; to chat about the happenings of the week. No censors were involved this week as no one had any problems speaking their minds. Due to this, the explicit tag is implied with force. F-bombs just kept falling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While refusing to hold back their tongues, the crew talked about the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; is putting their programming behind a pay wall starting August 15th. Here comes the networks&amp;#8217; attacks on Internet video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; blames the downward trend of their video on demand service on flash based porn sites. Huh?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Meyagi and Emdee talk a little about &lt;a href="http://www.xbox.com/halo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/"&gt;Humble Indie Bundle 3&lt;/a&gt; is out. Go get it folks! Free time on &lt;a href="http://www.minecraft.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you purchase it soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original maker of Stormtrooper armor for Star Wars, &lt;a href="http://originalstormtrooper.com/"&gt;Andrew Ainsworth&lt;/a&gt;, won his legal battle against &lt;a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/"&gt;Lucas Arts&lt;/a&gt; in UK courts. Lawyers play it off as the United Kingdom being a bastion for piracy that doesn&amp;#8217;t protect works of art. The crew has some arguments about who is right in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has more cash in hand than the US Government. What. The. Hell. People. This leads to a little rant on the state of the economy and how people cope with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nintendo 3DS has a price drop from $249 to $169. Were you a first adopter? Don&amp;#8217;t worry! You get some old games you won&amp;#8217;t want to play for your support. A discussion ensues about the handheld game market and the impact and convenience of the mobile phone market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get sidetracked about the nostalgia of games that used to be hard. Games are starting to make a come back to that with titles like &lt;a href="http://www.catherinethegame.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catherine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sega.com/platinumgames/bayonetta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bayonetta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Draeno still never found that Unreal map name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/"&gt;Raspberry PI&lt;/a&gt; $25 HDMI device is being released. While a great piece of technology, will anyone actually have a use for it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rim.com/"&gt;RIM&lt;/a&gt; laid off 2000 people. Is this their own fault due to lack of innovation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An off comment about &lt;em&gt;E.R.&lt;/em&gt; leads to a short discussion on messed up statistics, doctor mortality rates, and guns. Looking forward to that &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; spot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t forget &amp;#8211; PictoChat at PAX is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>In a rather casual atmosphere this week, Emdee and Draeno welcomes back Mr. Meyagi of The Spirits of Fire to chat about the happenings of the week. No censors this week as everyone involved has no problems speaking their minds. Due to this, the explicit tag is implied with force. F-bombs just kept falling!  Topics discussed include Fox's programming paywall, Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, the Humble Indie Bundle 3, the Stormtrooper armor's designer's legal woes, the 3DS price drop, RIM layoffs, and more.</itunes:summary>

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;OSX was introduced in 2000 as the future of the MacOS with the intent of leaving the old architecture of OS9 and before well behind.&#160; Eleven years later, the seventh major revision of the UNIX and NextStep based operating system was released- OSX Lion.&#160; Does this big cat have teeth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-165"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any OS revision on any platform anywhere, there are pros and cons for upgrading depending on the age of your hardware and a few other factors.&#160; Prohibited from upgrading is any Core Solo or Core Duo equipped mac- any Core 2 Duo and beyond machine is upgradeable.&#160; So, you can safely assume that any mac manufactured after mid-2007 is eligible for upgrade.&#160; As long as you have 4 gigabytes or more of RAM, some rudimentary speed trials suggest that Lion is worth installing purely from an OS speed perspective.&#160; If you don&amp;#8217;t have the 4 gigabytes, then it&amp;#8217;s either time for a new Mac or more RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the major Macintosh hardware shift from PowerPC architecture to Intel processors in 2006, Apple developed Rosetta.&#160; Rosetta is a stopgap software compatibility layer allowing the older PowerPC developed software to run on the newer Intel based hardware.&#160; Some software took ages to migrate- notably Quicken and just about every Adobe product all the way from the creative suite down to the humble flash player.&#160; Under Lion, the Rosetta layer is completely gone.&#160; For clarity, PowerPC designed software will not run under Lion.&#160; Still using Adobe Creative Suite 2 and don&amp;#8217;t want to upgrade?&#160; Don&amp;#8217;t upgrade to Lion.&#160; As with any new OS, research compatibility of mission critical software first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly the entire OpenGL driver codebase has been replaced in Lion.&#160; In real world applications gamers will experience about a 6-10% increase in performance (including the Source engine) but your mileage may vary.&#160; OpenGL 3.2 is included versus 2.x in Snow Leopard, but 3.2 must be explicitly supported in your application.&#160; OpenGL 4.0 is still regretfully not included, but internet hearsay suggests before Lion&amp;#8217;s lifecycle is complete version 4.0 will be included.&#160; OpenGL 3.2 versus 4.0 doesn&amp;#8217;t imply poorer performance than it could be- OpenGL library revisions do not equate enhanced performance, but it is an improvement overall.&#160; Apple literature speaks of a &amp;#8220;clean break&amp;#8221; between previous versions of OpenGL and the new libraries- so code monkeys, take heed for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an overall user perspective, the OS is flashier.&#160; This is good and bad.&#160; If you like Apple&amp;#8217;s iOS, then you&amp;#8217;ll like Lion and the nods in that direction.&#160; If you like graphical flash, then you&amp;#8217;ll like Lion.&#160; Speaking from the perspective of an old-school user, Lion is a bit over the top with unnecessary presentation.&#160; It&amp;#8217;s a bit harder from a user troubleshooting perspective to get to critical folders as the OS is installed, but it&amp;#8217;s fixable with some command line wizardry.&#160; Some Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices are incompatible or not completely compatible with Lion due to Apple&amp;#8217;s inclusion of Netatalk 2.2 rather than including some backwards compatibility.&#160; The fault for this lies with the NAS vendors, Apple, and the Netatalk codebase maintainer.&#160; The vendors could have upgraded to the newer DHX2 authentication method some time ago.&#160; The cleanest and most obvious solution would have been Apple not removing DHCAST128 support for older authentication methods.&#160; Capping the issue off, NetAFP, the maintainer of the Netatalk library, closed the source for the driver releasing it to only to customers who pay for support.&#160; At press time, Synology devices have a beta patch, but many LaCie and Iomega devices remain crippled.&#160; DHCAST128 support is addable with some &lt;a href="http://www.alexanderwilde.com/2011/04/os-x-lion-connection-error-with-afp-and-workaround/"&gt;command line wizardry as well&lt;/a&gt;.&#160; In my opinion, both of these omissions are fairly critical and should have been at least selectable with a checkbox.&#160; Being forced to hit the sometimes arcane command line to enable a critical feature for many users seems contrary to the simplifications that have been introduced with this version of OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an IT perspective, the $50 add-on to turn Lion into Lion Server is a bit of a mixed blessing.&#160; Some options are moved, some libraries have been upgraded to compatibility&amp;#8217;s detriment, a few older features are gone without a trace, and many new options are included.&#160; Lion Server seems more intended for a home server application rather than a corporate or business implementation.&#160; Time will ultimately tell on this, but for now, I recommend that IT departments stick with Snow Leopard server, rather than upgrading to Lion Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not historically an early OS release adopter.&#160; There are older machines that I&amp;#8217;m responsible for running Leopard, and since they do what I need them to do without any fuss there they will stay.&#160; I didn&amp;#8217;t even move to OSX until Jaguar, the second major revision after initial release.&#160; Lion is a substantive and mostly solid upgrade over Snow Leopard, and a worthy one at that, but to be clear it&amp;#8217;s not for everyone.&#160; As I mentioned earlier, every OS release has it&amp;#8217;s share of bugs, &amp;#8220;upgrades&amp;#8221; that aren&amp;#8217;t, and oddities. &#160;Lion is no exception.&#160; If you&amp;#8217;re going to upgrade to Lion, do so with full awareness of the caveats involved.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week Das Kalk and Anubis join us this week on the 20 Sides of Nerd of podcast for the release of OSX 10.7 Lion. As excited as most of the team was about the new release things eventually came back around to the normal way of things. We started talking about the new bells and whistles of the operating system, but things just started going downhill from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics for the week boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; OS 10.7 &lt;em&gt;Lion&lt;/em&gt; came out this week. Emdee, Das Kalk, and Anubis go on about their first impressions of the new operating system. Some of the fixes we mentioned are &lt;a href="http://www.mactrast.com/2011/07/how-to-show-the-user-library-directory-in-os-x-lion/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://frankleng.me/2011/07/21/connect-to-a-freenas-samba-or-afp-share-on-lion-workaround/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes are being made the future of the Mac hardware line ups, including &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/"&gt;Thunderbolt&lt;/a&gt; and lack of CD media drives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee reviews &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Best Baby Monitor App" href="http://bestbabymonitorapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Best Baby Monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for iOS devices. &#160;The Best Baby Monitor application was provided for review.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fan movie awards shows &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5823715/surprise-sizzle-reel-for-the-deleted-scenes-from-star-wars-original-trilogy"&gt;deleted scenes&lt;/a&gt; that will show up in the Blu-Ray release.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt; pre-order bonuses were announced. How much did your wallet get hit for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.borders.com/"&gt;Borders&lt;/a&gt; is going away finally. If you are shopping at the liquidation sales, make sure to check your prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somehow we start talking about warranties and cable qualities. Do yourself a favor and don&amp;#8217;t buy &lt;a href="http://www.monstercable.com/"&gt;Monster&lt;/a&gt; cables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer AI was given &lt;a href="http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Download"&gt;FreeCiv&lt;/a&gt;, learned to read the manual, and elevated to an 80% win rate before it started to learn from the game play itself. Be afraid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We share some thoughts on the &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/qJQS16dGk0w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/apMXFloDH6M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight Rises&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trailers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee says to play &lt;a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kerbal Space Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>A tale of two podcasts continues!  Das Kalk joins us and we discuss the final installment of Harry Potter, Torchwood, Alphas, Eureka, True Blood, Netflix price increases, $10 online passes, and the upcoming Evil Dead remake.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Tale of Two Casts continues with &amp;#8220;American Needs a Sandwich&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Episode 23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ScottWBradford"&gt;Das Kalk&lt;/a&gt; joins us on episode 23, which is one of our typical recordings. After the mess that was the previous episode, the return to the normal format was welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly scheduled topics were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final installment of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; movie franchise hit theaters this week. Most successful movie in history? Is it more successful than &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; for previous generations?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hit on some new genre TV: &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alphas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Eureka&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Warehouse 13&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Haven&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;True Blood&lt;/em&gt;. Someone it turns into Emdee and Draeno going off on a &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; tangent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; raised the price of subscriptions across the board. Still one hell of a value folks. Stop being so angry about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video game industry is down 10% in June 2010 and 2011. No kidding. Release some titles we care about and quit pushing people to the cheap mobile market. Is &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; partially to blame?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubi.com/"&gt;Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt; joins the $10 online pass club with &lt;em&gt;Driver: San Francisco&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We give a brief preview on &lt;a href="http://www.mercsminis.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MERCS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083907/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evil Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remake is coming around again. If that wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Cody"&gt;Diablo Cody&lt;/a&gt; is coming aboard to work on the script. Why?! STOP HOLLYWOOD. STOP. There was nothing wrong with it! There is no need to remake it!&lt;/li&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to some set backs in the lives of your hosts in recent history, we unfortunately had to delay putting the finishing touches on episode 22. I&amp;#8217;m sure that Emdee was thankful for the extra time since he edits ours casts every week. As it was something of an odd cast to record, it can only be imagined that there were some troubles piecing it together. Instead of holding it back for another week, we decided to hit you with two podcasts this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Tale of Two Casts Starts with &amp;#8220;Forgot the Waiver&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Episode 22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the slowest news week we&amp;#8217;ve ever encountered, we decided to wing a podcast. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Leetum"&gt;Leetum&lt;/a&gt; joins us again as we scour sites for news and whatever drifts into our minds as we are recording the cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crap we came up for as &amp;#8220;topics&amp;#8221; on this show were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone patents indicate that in the future you may be able to pour data from your phone to your tablet inspired by beer pouring. Sign us up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.playstation.com/psn/"&gt;PSN&lt;/a&gt; Japan finally is going back up. Too bad that so many people lost out on free games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TSA agent in Florida stole $50,000 worth of electronics. Why didn&amp;#8217;t anyone notice laptops in his pants?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; buttons supposedly has more presence than &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; buttons on websites. We take this as a good sign to look at our own website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space travel is going commercial now that the final shuttle launch has taken place. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British sci-fi has been embraced by Americans. Will the new season of &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt; be accepted as much as the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; revival was?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.paypal.com"&gt;Paypal&lt;/a&gt; says the wallet is going to go away by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class action lawsuit is being formed against &lt;a href="http://www.sony.com"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; for shutting down &lt;a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars Galaxies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public sourced photography project in &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; store gains the artist the attention of the Secret Service. &amp;#8216;Cause you know, accessing computers that aren&amp;#8217;t yours and taking pictures of people without permission is always a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Award for the most useless phone add-on goes to, &lt;a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/iphone-slr-mount/"&gt;the DSLR lens attachment for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two cancelled soap operas are just going to continue online. Apparently someone didn&amp;#8217;t get the memo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First pictures of the dwarves from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; film were released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/civworld"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt; makes its way to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Congrats on getting out there more, but shame on you for turning it into a Facebook game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                    <description>Ever since getting the first glimpse of John Barrowman as a rogue time agent Captain Jack Harkness in the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; episode &lt;em&gt;The Empty Child&lt;/em&gt;, I had a feeling I was watching something great unfold. Harkness appeared to be a complex character with more to him that was willing to be told to the usual fans of the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; serials. This made me realize that there was something that &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; had been missing all along. It was missing an edge. Sure, there was a push towards the darker depths of The Doctor towards the end of Sylvester McCoy's run, but I knew that Capt. Jack would be the character that would fill that niche. If you've been watching &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; since its revival in 2005 you might have had an idea that something was going to come across the horizon. Lo and behold, Russell T. Davies derived a spin off featuring Capt. Jack called &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ever since getting the first glimpse of John Barrowman as a rogue time agent Captain Jack Harkness in the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; episode &lt;em&gt;The Empty Child&lt;/em&gt;, I had a feeling I was watching something great unfold. Harkness appeared to be a complex character with more to him that was willing to be told to the usual fans of the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; serials. This made me realize that there was something that &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; had been missing all along. It was missing an edge. Sure, there was a push towards the darker depths of The Doctor towards the end of Sylvester McCoy&amp;#8217;s run, but I knew that Capt. Jack would be the character that would fill that niche. If you&amp;#8217;ve been watching &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; since its revival in 2005 you might have had an idea that something was going to come across the horizon. Lo and behold, Russell T. Davies derived a spin off featuring Capt. Jack called &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-148"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_147" style="width: 874px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/blog/are-you-ready-for-the-miracle/attachment/torchwood-md-jack/" rel="attachment wp-att-147"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Torchwood-MD-Jack.jpg" alt="Torchwood leader and star of series Captain Jack Harkness" title="Torchwood MD Jack" width="864" height="648" class="size-full wp-image-147" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Torchwood leader and star of series Captain Jack Harkness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolving the idea of the previous iterations of the Torchwood Institute, Capt. Harkness wanted to track down, use, and learn from alien technology to better prepare the human race for what was coming. The title sequence breaks it down simply as we hear Jack telling us that the &amp;#8220;21st century is when everything changes.&amp;#8221; The show starts out as a police style procedural jumping from alien hunting to conspiracies to worldwide emergencies week by week. Instead of looking at the humdrum of what it is to deal with the ever stressful life as an officer, &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt; places us in a rather weird yet human position. Characters take us to a place where we see the black hole one faces when looking into the reaches of our souls, our interactions with one another. What we ended up with was a show that not only pushes the limits of modern sci-fi, but also explores the ideas of an pansexual character, what happens when we&amp;#8217;re alone, and the consequences of keeping secrets. Best of all the height of what it can show us as yet to be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting out as a late night show, it was able to have a pretty open reign on what some folks might consider offensive. As popularity grew though and it worked its way up the BBC ranks, some the overtly sexual and physicality had to be toned down. Eventually it ended up on BBC One for the last series, &lt;em&gt;Children of Earth&lt;/em&gt;. Each time it moved, it seemed that it grew a little bit softer on the barriers. However, this is when the writing really began to shine. Season three was touted as being a special arc that would only last five episodes. What we were shown in spite of this was a concise, rich, nothing short of amazing bit of storytelling. Out of the success from &lt;em&gt;Children of Earth&lt;/em&gt; a new dynamic was born. Instead of the case of the week episode, it matured into the longer serial style that carries on into &lt;em&gt;Miracle Day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the viewer is faced with in &lt;em&gt;Torchwood: Miracle Day&lt;/em&gt; is quite different than subjects that have been touched on in science fiction before. The idea of a world without death.  Aging carries on taking its toll, but never realizing an end. The sick remain sick and the injured, no matter how gruesome, continue to be so. Imagine if you will a place where a person that has been impaled by sign or someone that had been caught in an explosion had to carry on their days in constant pain. Sadly, that is what is taking place after the event starts. All of human kind is faced with the idea of life eternal. What makes it even worse is that it is revealed that due to this boom in population, it is putting a strain on the resources of the planet putting us at an inviable position in a mere four months. Faced with the impossible reality of the unknown while fighting their new found roles in life, the &lt;em&gt;Torchwood&lt;/em&gt; team strikes out to set things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue the preview of Torchwood: Miracle Day after the break&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It has been awhile since we've featured a fourth guest during recording, but it was nice to revisit it. It sure made for some interesting things happening in the background to say the least.  Topics covered include Bungie Aerospace, World of Warcraft free up to level 20, the ProtectIP act, Prince no longer recording due to music piracy, Starz's Camelot, and Star Wars: Galaxies shutdown.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder what goes through our minds when we record the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast. On another sidetracked podcast &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Leetum"&gt;Leetum&lt;/a&gt; joined in, with the addition of Mr. Meyagi from &lt;a href="http://www.spiritsoffire.com/"&gt;Spirits of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. It has been awhile since we&amp;#8217;ve featured a fourth guest during recording, but it was nice to revisit it. It sure made for some interesting things happening in the background to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, even with random desk related activities in the middle of everything, we ran across the following list of topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bungie.net/projects/aerospace/"&gt;Bungie Aerospace&lt;/a&gt; is revealed as an indie game incubator.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is free to play up to level 20 now. The &lt;a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/"&gt;pusher man&lt;/a&gt; is getting you hooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIAA says that Protect IP is needed now in lieu of the Lulzsec and Anonymous attacks. The RIAA apparently lost their marbles again. Just change your model guys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prince says that he will no longer record music because of piracy. According to him, piracy is akin to car jacking.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.starz.com/originals/camelot"&gt;Camelot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was canned. Was it because of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html"&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/262/index.jsp"&gt;Torchwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/"&gt;Star Wars Galaxies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has announced its cancellation. No one is shocked or saddened by this.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dumps all of its California affiliates because of new Internet tax laws. Is this sound reasoning? Why wouldn&amp;#8217;t you tax Internet purchases? If we tax it, where are our infrastructure improvements?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble is brewing between &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.samsung.com/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; once again. Even with Apple moving their processors away from Samsung, this is something that will go on for some time. Hope that you weren&amp;#8217;t looking forward to any new products from Samsung any time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.capcom.com/"&gt;Capcom&lt;/a&gt; makes &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.residentevil.com/mercs/agegate.php"&gt;Resident Evil: Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with only one save slot possible with no way to wipe it. Is this a new trend in trying to kill the used gaming market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee gives a preview of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ascendancy/id412523782?mt=8#"&gt;Ascendancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.logicfactory.com"&gt;Logic Factory&lt;/a&gt; for iOS.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; was sold to Specific Media for $35 million. News Corp. lost money. We&amp;#8217;re not sad about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google lost in the Nortel patent bid against a consortium of companies (&lt;a href="http://www.sony.com"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mircosoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rim.com/"&gt;RIM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/home?cc=us&amp;amp;lc=en"&gt;Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.emc.com"&gt;EMC&lt;/a&gt;). There was no reason why they should have lost this. Is this evidence of a loss of confidence in Android?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geek Projects &amp;#8211; We speak about the idea of building your own computer rather than purchasing a pre-made box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. &amp;#8211; Emdee wants all your &lt;em&gt;Marathon&lt;/em&gt; swag.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>On another sidetracked podcast Leetum joined in, with the addition of Mr. Meyagi from the Spirits of Fire. It has been awhile since we've featured a fourth guest during recording, but it was nice to revisit it. It sure made for some interesting things happening in the background to say the least.  Topics covered include Bungie Aerospace, World of Warcraft free up to level 20, the ProtectIP act, Prince no longer recording due to music piracy, Starz's Camelot, and Star Wars: Galaxies shutdown.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>In the beginning there was Warcraft 3.  Warcraft 3 begat mods.  One of these mods was the proto-tower defense game.  Once the first tower defense game arrived, the floodgates were open for more.  Desktop Tower Defense.  Bloons.  Hordes of Orcs.  Defense Grid: The Awakening.  The list goes on and on, and the varieties of gameplay options afforded by each variant does as well.  As part of their Amnesia Fortnight initiative spawned by the (quite tragic, in my opinion) collapse of the Brutal Legend franchise, Double Fine developed and released Trenched with the assistance of the Microsoft Game Studio.  As with most Tower Defense (TD) games, Trenched is hard to simply classify.  In a grossly oversimplified nutshell, Trenched is tower defense pureed with a savory helping of customizable giant stomping robot and garnished with a powder of RPG progression.  Is the blend satisfying and refreshing, though?</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-132" href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/review-trenched-by-double-fine/attachment/10/"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-132" title="Get some, Tube!" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/10-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s note- when Trenched ships in the EU in October or November, it&amp;#8217;ll be called &amp;#8220;Iron Brigade&amp;#8221; worldwide.  We&amp;#8217;re not changing the review, but where you see &amp;#8220;Trenched&amp;#8221;, perhaps you may want to substitute &amp;#8220;Iron Brigade&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was Warcraft 3.  Warcraft 3 begat mods.  One of these mods was the proto-tower defense game.  Once the first tower defense game arrived, the floodgates were open for more.  Desktop Tower Defense.  Bloons.  Hordes of Orcs. &#160;Defense Grid: The Awakening.  The list goes on and on, and the varieties of gameplay options afforded by each variant does as well.  As part of their Amnesia Fortnight initiative spawned by the (quite tragic, in my opinion) collapse of the Brutal Legend franchise, Double Fine developed and released Trenched with the assistance of the Microsoft Game Studio.  As with most Tower Defense (TD) games, Trenched is hard to simply classify.  In a grossly oversimplified nutshell, Trenched is tower defense pureed with a savory helping of customizable giant stomping robot and garnished with a powder of RPG progression.  Is the blend satisfying and refreshing, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At it&amp;#8217;s core, Trenched is about the war between the Monovision and the Mobile Trench Brigade.  You are the heroic, patriotic, square jawed trench pilot who must keep the hordes of the Monovisions at bay.  At some point, you must fight off kamikazes, snipers, riflemen, melee specialists, heavies, and so forth.  At first glance, the general classifications of enemies feels fairly standard, but the sinewy technology unchained art direction of the Monovision baddies really sets them apart from the rest of the tower defense games I&amp;#8217;ve played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lock and Load!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defending your objectives, you have a large variety of custom options for your giant stomping robot- your mobile trench.  There are long range and short range weaponry, mines and anti-aircraft cannons just to name a few.  You can pick heavy weapons for your trench, or a large variety of emplacements to drop- but not both.  The pre-mission briefings give you a pretty good idea of what weapons load out you&amp;#8217;ll need, but won&amp;#8217;t completely prevent you from taking a completely inappropriate one to your own detriment.  Pay attention to the mission briefings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight the Good Fight!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following trench customization, the battle begins!  While you can equip up to four emplacements, depending on your Trench chassis selection, being able to place them is another matter entirely.  Trenched currency is scrap, blasted off of your monovision foes.  You typically have enough scrap to place a single turret or two, and this initial placement makes all the difference in the opening phases of each level.  Do you need area denial in the form of mines, or a shotgun turret?  Would a repair tower be in your best interest or a sniper tower?  As you collect scrap as the level progresses and the bad guy destruction accumulates, you can drop more towers or upgrade existing ones in real time.  This isn&amp;#8217;t a game that allows you to pause it and build your defenses!  There&amp;#8217;s a brief window after you call for a tower or upgrade where your purchase isn&amp;#8217;t available as it&amp;#8217;s constructing, so plan your time wisely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a public service announcement for the heavy tower defense game players- Trenched doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to build a torturous maze for the baddies to progress through as some tower defense games do.  Offsetting this somewhat is the level design that rarely allows the baddies a straight shot at your objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collector or Hoarder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game keeps track of all manners of statistics.  Weapon kills overall.  Shotgun kills. &#160;Machine gun kills.  If you can kill tubes with it, then it&amp;#8217;s counted.  This count applies towards two different totals- both your own, and your entire regiment&amp;#8217;s total.  The game spits out rewards for you both as an individual and as a regiment as your totals grow, even if you as a player aren&amp;#8217;t with the rest of the regiment on any particular game session.  Yes, if the rest of your group are off blasting tubes, and you are offline with mundane real life tasks to perform you do share in the spoils. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s no way to form a static regiment so the game counts the last nine players you played co-op with.  Fair trade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mission is over and you&amp;#8217;ve driven the enemy before you, the regiment returns to your carrier to re-outfit and reap the rewards of your victory.  Equipment you collected during the battle Diablo-style for your trenches is added to your inventory and cash is collected in proportion to the level of enemy brutalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controls are tight.  I saw no flaws in the technical aspects of single player combat with the monovision menace.  Multiplayer suffered a bit from player dropouts and serious lag during the first week of play, but a title update that my console downloaded for the title on June 28th helped a great deal with network conditions.  I experienced no graphical glitches or frame rate issues while playing both single player and with three other co-op players regardless of the quantities of explosions or baddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Not All Good, Is It?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d really like there to be pre-built Trench slots that you as a player can quickly switch between.  Different levels often have vastly different requirements all the way down to which legs to use on your Trench making the quickswap Trench slots a gameplay convenience issue.  Also, Trenched begs for a survival/firefight/horde gameplay mode and more equipment.  Maybe in the future?  None of these issues are showstoppers, but more of a &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d like to have&amp;#8221; situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a star or percentage rating kind of guy.  To me, and to anybody who enjoys either tower defense or giant stomping robot style play, the 1200 Microsoft point cost is well worth the price of admission.  If you&amp;#8217;re on the fence about either genre, the gameplay is rewarding enough to still warrant a purchase on sale for 800 points. &#160;I still think it&amp;#8217;s worth any gamer&amp;#8217;s time at 1200.  Go buy it now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say this- Trenched is probably the best game I&amp;#8217;ve ever downloaded from xBox Live Arcade, with Toy Soldiers being a close second.  Bring on the DLC, Double Fine!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>We made it! Finally we're able to bring you the hardly imagined episode 20 of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast. Emdee and myself could hardly believe we'd make it this long. We'd like to toss out a thank you for all our listeners. You guys make it happen for us. Now that the mushy stuff is out of the way, I can deliver some bonus news. Leetum joined us this week to lend some of his knowledge as we launch a new feature of the podcast, Geek Projects. Here, we hope to inform your faithful listeners of some of the things you should be doing, might be interested in doing, or at least informing your of our mistakes. Pretty sweet, right?  In any event, topics covered include Team Fortress 2 free to play, Hellgate London's open beta, Eve Online's micro transactions, iPad Marathon, the iCloud and how it affects iWeb and MobileMe services, Pottermore, and the Green Lantern movie review.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We made it! Finally we&amp;#8217;re able to bring you the hardly imagined episode 20 of the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast. Emdee and myself could hardly believe we&amp;#8217;d make it this long. We&amp;#8217;d like to toss out a thank you for all our listeners. You guys make it happen for us. Now that the mushy stuff is out of the way, I can deliver some bonus news. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Leetum"&gt;Leetum&lt;/a&gt; joined us this week to lend some of his knowledge as we launch a new feature of the podcast, Geek Projects. Here, we hope to inform your faithful listeners of some of the things you should be doing, might be interested in doing, or at least informing your of our mistakes. Pretty sweet, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of launching the Geek Projects feature, we gleefully marched into these topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; has made &lt;em&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/em&gt; free to play! Why did it take so long?&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellgate: London&lt;/em&gt; open beta launches &lt;a href="http://hellgate.t3fun.com/intro.html"&gt;soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eveonline.com/"&gt;EVE Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; riots start over the inclusion of game changing micro payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details from a class action lawsuit details how &lt;a href="http://www.sony.com/"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; fired security personnel prior to the PSN attacks.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marathon&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the iPad as a free game on July 7th. Pick it up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the launch of iCloud, iWeb and Mobile me will be going away in June 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; left everyone&amp;#8217;s account open to access with any password for four hours. Shouldn&amp;#8217;t they be using two party authentication for this by now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; brings an end to unlimited data plans in July. Cloud computing is getting more costly everyday.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pottermore.com/"&gt;Pottermore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Additional writings for the universe, exclusive digital book copies, and the blatant rip off of the &amp;#8220;webcomic&amp;#8221; business model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newest iteration of &lt;a href="http://www.marvel.com/"&gt;Marvel&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ghost Rider&lt;/em&gt; is a woman. Looking forward to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prelude to Draeno&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; movie review. A discussion ensues about the placement of origin stories in comic to film adaptations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee previews &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trenchedgame.com/"&gt;Trenched&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.doublefine.com/"&gt;Double Fine&lt;/a&gt; on XBLA.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geek projects &amp;#8211; We start a new feature on the podcast covering some of the things you as a geek should be doing. This week we go over hard wiring your house for your Internet/network over relying on wireless connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks! Thanks for letting us have a week off!&lt;/p&gt;

Yet again we find ourselves at a convergence of films based on comic franchises that are all fighting for your movie going experience.

&lt;p&gt;Here we are in yet another summer chock-full of blockbuster movies. Looking across the spectrum, one can’t help but to let out their inner fan boy. Yet again we find ourselves at a convergence of films based on comic franchises that are all fighting for your movie going experience. While three of the softer impact films rolled in before the solstice (&lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Priest&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;X-men: First Class&lt;/em&gt;), the harder hitting films started firing off last week. DC Comics rolled out their only offering of the season with &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-120"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that aren’t familiar with the history of the Green Lanterns don’t fret. We’re here to help. To put it very simply, the Green Lantern Corp was created by the Guardians of the Universe, an ancient race of thinkers and scientists, as an intergalactic police force. The Guardians divided known space into 3600 sectors, assigning a living being of strong moral standing that possessed strength of will and fearlessness to defend it. To aid the Lanterns, each was given a power ring of immensely advanced technology that was able to manipulate and create objects that were only limited by their imaginations and willpower among other things. The only catch being that they were unable to affect items of yellow in color (dependant on which era of the comic) and had a need to be recharged by a power battery. Hal Jordan, the most well-known Green Lantern, came to be the first modern era human member of the Corps upon the death of Abin Sur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_123" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/beware-green-lanterns-blight/attachment/green-lantern-group/" rel="attachment wp-att-123"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Green-Lantern-Group-300x225.jpg" alt="Group shot of the Lanterns at the core of the story." title="Green Lantern Group" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-123" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Group shot of the Lanterns at the core of the story. (Left to Right: Hal Jordan, Tomar-Re. Sinestro, and Kilowog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the script stuck to the basic story that’s been given to us since the 1940s. As a comic fan I must admit that I applauded this. There has been far too many times that you find that writers just plain ignored important details in these pre-existing characters. With that, one has to realize that a movie is just a snapshot in the entire existences of these creations. As comics are constantly re-launched with alterations to their history, it can be hard to accurately portray all events. Especially considering that &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; has over 60 years of history, it is amazing that they stuck as close as they did. The entire story is a mash up of mostly Silver Age origins with points taken from the 2008 rebirth of the title by DC Comics. Add in the fact that all of the &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; comics have such undergone relatively minor changes by comic standards and you’ll notice that a faithful creation was bestowed upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides sticking to the majority of the mythos surrounding the comic by the same name, there were a few other things that the movie seemed to get right. The CGI worlds and effects that were generated were great (minus the suits, yuck). It looks like the extra $9 million Warner Brothers dumped into the film for effects at the last minute paid off. Once you see the Lantern’s world of Oa, you’ll see why. There was no shortage of different aliens that were created to show off on the gathering scenes. This was an important thing for them to do since the Corp is made up from species of the entire universe. The impending doom that was Parallax was greatly represented in his graphical form. While different from the comic, there was still that oozing sense of fear that just seemed to roll off of him. The human struggle was also properly represented. First we notice Hal Jordan, played by Ryan Reynolds, wanting to give up because it is just too hard. Later on, he turns around with the true face of humanity, the will to survive at all costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_126" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/beware-green-lanterns-blight/attachment/green-lantern/" rel="attachment wp-att-126"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Green-Lantern-Parallax-300x225.jpg" alt="Parallax wants your soul! Sweet CGI effects though." title="Green Lantern Parallax" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-126" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The CGI on the villain Parallax was stellar. You can even make out creatures in the blob which are closer to what he actually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; got far more wrong as a movie than it did right. Even with the fact that the background was carried out well, the rest of the movie suffered from a real lack of plot. It seemed as if the writers lost the idea of what the story was going to be a quarter of the way through the film. It leaves the viewer with questions about its intent. Was it to be a background story? Or was it going to be a one off so they needed to cram more stuff into it? Were the elements of the relationship between Jordan and Ferris in the script originally? Why is so little learned about Sinestro? What it ended up being was a relatively actionless, slow crawl of a film with no clear villain focus. Parallax is represented a distant cry of the evil force it is from the story in the series, so it presents a problem if things were to move on to more films. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the ridiculous chain gun construct idea is bleeding over to the new re-launch of &lt;em&gt;Justice League #1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_122" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/beware-green-lanterns-blight/attachment/green-lantern-film-comic-bleed/" rel="attachment wp-att-122"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Green-Lantern-Film-Comic-Bleed-300x225.jpg" alt="Whose ridiculous idea was the chain gun? Idea is now bleeding over to modern comics." title="Green Lantern Film-Comic Bleed" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-122" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Whose ridiculous idea was the chain gun? Idea is now bleeding over to modern comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the conclusion on the next page!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Jackbacks" href="http://www.jackbacks.com" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Baumgartner&lt;/a&gt; has crafted an excellent way to individualize your iPhone 4.&#160; Jackbacks are a combined plastic and wood product that replaces your existing back panel.&#160; It&amp;#8217;s not a cheap laminate product- the wood is securely fastened to an original equipment manufacturer&amp;#8217;s (OEM) plastic back panel, just like the glass panel that is secured to the panel on the back of a stock iPhone 4 bezel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve taken some measurements.&#160; The iPhone following installation of a Jackback is exactly the same thickness, and 4 grams lighter.&#160; Considering that you&amp;#8217;ll likely remove any external case or bumper following installation, that removes some weight as well- in my case, 15 grams.&#160; We&amp;#8217;re not talking a relief for armstrain or anything, but the difference in weight, while sleight, is still noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this isn&amp;#8217;t an inexpensive Ikea knockoff product- they&amp;#8217;re all crafted and finished by hand.&#160; The Jackbacks start at $90 and work their way up from there.&#160; Various bamboos, walnut, cherry, maple, mahogany (which is what was supplied to me), bird&amp;#8217;s eye maple, lacewood, wenge, and walnut burl are available, as are custom etching jobs.&#160; Backs are available for both the AT+T and Verizon versions of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many iPhone accessories, some crap, some not.&#160; A Jackback is certainly not crap, and is one of the few iPhone add-ons that I think are worth buying if you&amp;#8217;re looking to stand out from the pack.&#160; If you&amp;#8217;ve got the extra sponduliks laying about, I highly recommend the Jackback.&lt;/p&gt;

Space. What a vast and wonderful playground. A place, that even in our youth, we never could quite fill it up with our imaginations. As a society we’ve dreamt of it, built stories featuring it, and have even expanded to it. We continuously look up at it acknowledging its very existence, but are reminded in the same way just how little we are in comparison to it. Why then has it taken me so long to play a tabletop game based in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.mj12games.com/"&gt;Majestic 12 Games&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; takes the basics of what it is like to be a fleet commander and locks you into an epic encounter capsule. You and a friend (sworn enemy in this case) take the stage in your very own slice of galactic pie. Face to face you wage war letting the harrowing mistress, better known as space, decide who will ultimately be victorious. Turn by turn each commander see his victory chances unfold. Not exactly in a way one may think though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each turn breaks into four different parts: orders, movement, combat, and ending phases. To begin, the game launches into the orders phase, as indicated by well, the order of operations. Here players plot out the movement of their vessels based on their engine speed. Once each player has plotted their courses, movements play out at the same time in the following movement phase. Movement is actually quite unique in &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike many games, Newton’s First Law of Motion actually plays a role here. Players must remember that objects will keep their momentum when they first start moving. Otherwise, you could face losing a ship’s turn in a round or quite possibly their ship. All moves are completed at the same time allowing for space placement conflict to be resolved at it comes. Once completed, combat begins!  Combat is another feature with plays into a different situation that most war games. Rather than battle out in opposite turns, all battle is done in one large phase ship after ship. This way no one player can dominate in their first turn. This keeps the game going in a fair way, rather than having the victory determined by the first dice roll. Damage is tracked and all tallied during the following phase, which is aptly named the end phase. Here points are awarded to the victors for destroying ships and all destruction is assessed to the appropriate targets to prepare for the next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first sit down to play/make war with your “friend” you need to  decide in which way you are to play the game. Starting could be as  simple as selecting pre-made, simpler versions of ships or as complex as  creating your own war machines from the literature provided. Using a  fleet building technique not unlike that of building an army in  Warhammer, you build your force around a point structure. Each ship has  its own combat rating based on what it is and what options it has  installed. To stop would be galactic expanders from using “The Ultimate  Ship,” the game prohibits the use of any ship that would be greater than  the half the total of your entire fleet total. For instance, if you  were to agree on a battle of each side totaling up to 1000 points, no  ship could be greater than 500 in combat score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_111" style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-111" href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20-sides-of-nerd-review-starmada/attachment/starmada_001/"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-111 " title="Sample Starmada Ship Card" src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Starmada_001-632x1024.jpg" alt="Sample Starmada Ship Card" width="379" height="614" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A sample frigate ship card from Starmada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of testing, the simplest approach was taken for creating an armada. Pre-generated ships from the book were given a random number and dice were used to determine which would be used. In the end, six ships were given to each side with a point total of 1020. Ships were broken down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiftsure-class Destroyer (96)&lt;br /&gt;
Swiftsure-class Destroyer (96)&lt;br /&gt;
Volhard-class Cruiser (168)&lt;br /&gt;
Victory-Class Heavy Cruiser (220)&lt;br /&gt;
Victory-Class Heavy Cruiser (220)&lt;br /&gt;
Wraak-class Battlecruiser (220)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_112" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/20-sides-of-nerd-review-starmada/attachment/starmada_002/" rel="attachment wp-att-112"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Starmada_002-300x225.jpg" alt="Apparently this captian likes to navigate by the horns." title="Starmada Setup" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-112" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Apparently this captian likes to navigate by the horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing the game was actually extremely easy after the passing of a few game turns. There are no complex tables to memorize or overtly impossible weapon statistics to reference every time you attempt to make an attack. Actions are smooth and fluid as they play out. This results in very few instances of bickering over rules. The only important things to remember are the movement restrictions, as well as, range bonuses and penalties. All ranges are built as multiples of three, so it is really easy to know which third of distance you are from your would be assailant. There are some silly rules, but if you think of them in terms of reality they do make sense. Things such as not calling which target you are firing upon results in a ship firing into blank space. If you aren’t aiming at something, it’s a tad hard to actually hit anything isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue the review after the break!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week we bring you a special treat on the 20 Sides of Nerd podcast. We bring you the plague from both sides of the coast! Both Emdee and Draeno managed to catch different variations of the flu on their respective coasts. That doesn&amp;#8217;t stop us from bringing you another invigorating episode of the podcast though! With the &lt;a href="http://www.e3expo.com/"&gt;Electronic Entertainment Expo&lt;/a&gt; bringing us such a plethora of topics, there is no way we could deny you faithful listener! To top it off, you get to listen to only the dynamic duo this week. No third wheel to add off color commentary. No couch jockey bringing you their version of events. Only us&amp;#8230;doing that anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We scraped up enough energy to cover these topics this week, hopefully not getting you sick in the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announces iOS 5, iCloud, and Lion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers raise their voices at &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; copying features from their submitted applications that have now been incorporated into the new version OS. Those wi-fi sync logos sure look mighty similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average age of a gamer is actually older than you think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We speak about a few things that popped up during the &lt;a href="http://www.e3expo.com/"&gt;Electronic Entertainment Expo&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; put on a bikini car wash. Wasn&amp;#8217;t this supposed to be a press event?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Razer has some new interesting peripherals coming out for &lt;em&gt;The Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary&lt;/em&gt; will be coming out this year! &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U95yDEhEUl8"&gt;Check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; was announced to fan boy criticism. Just wait folks it&amp;#8217;ll probably be different than the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deGwykkr2z8"&gt;rendered teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee lets loose his gripe with game developers making inaccurate submarines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wii U&lt;/em&gt; was announced. &lt;a href="http://www.nintendo.com"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; brings out a new console that shies away from what made the &lt;em&gt;Wii&lt;/em&gt; successful to appear to the &amp;#8220;hardcore&amp;#8221; market. Will gimmicks win the crowd over or will this be another flawed offering?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nyko.com/"&gt;Nyko&lt;/a&gt; has a new &lt;em&gt;Kinect&lt;/em&gt; sensor that allows players to use less space. Why didn&amp;#8217;t this happen in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno gives his thoughts on the &lt;em&gt;Duke Nukem Forever&lt;/em&gt; demo. In all honesty folks, based on what the demo offers we cannot recommend this for purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team gives a review on the tabletop starship combat game, &lt;em&gt;Starmada&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.mj12games.com/"&gt;Majestic 12 Games&lt;/a&gt;. Heartily approved by both Emdee and Draeno.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tennessee passes some odd laws about sharing account information with people you know and offending people on the Internet with images. How are citizens letting this stuff happen there?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;*Disclosure – Item was provided by company for review. Look for a writeup in the days to come.&lt;/h5&gt;

                    <description>Another fabulous episode of 20 Sides of Nerd comes to you right before the media blitz begins for E3. Even while you're bombarded with nerd and gaming stimuli, we hope that you'll still be able to squeak some time in to listen to our particular version of babble. Be prepared for next week though, I'm sure we'll just over saturate you as well as everyone else does. Das Kalk comes aboard this week, even as he is locked in epic battle against his router. Who will be the winner? Time will only tell once people in his house stop downloading Angry Birds during podcast recording.  Topics covered include the upcoming iCloud announcement, Adobe's master collection, 80s music, Penny Arcade's New Kid has been optioned to Paramount, DC rebooting, Electronic Arts' Origin service, China versus the US cyber war, and carcinogenic cellphones.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Another fabulous episode of 20 Sides of Nerd comes to you right before the media blitz begins for E3. Even while you&amp;#8217;re bombarded with nerd and gaming stimuli, we hope that you&amp;#8217;ll still be able to squeak some time in to listen to our particular version of babble. Be prepared for next week though, I&amp;#8217;m sure we&amp;#8217;ll just over saturate you as well as everyone else does. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ScottWBradford/"&gt;Das Kalk&lt;/a&gt; comes aboard this week, even as he is locked in epic battle against his router. Who will be the winner? Time will only tell once people in his house stop downloading &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt; during podcast recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it commentary jumbled around and cut out, we covered the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; is making an announcement next week on their iCloud service. It doesn&amp;#8217;t appear that you&amp;#8217;ll be able to upload things to it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.e3expo.com/"&gt;E3&lt;/a&gt; starts! Be prepared for the media overload!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankfully &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection.html"&gt;Photoshop CS 5.5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will not only available through a leasing model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We somehow manage to get caught up on &amp;#8217;80s music. Apparently &lt;a href="http://www.a-ha.com/"&gt;A-ha&lt;/a&gt; is still a hot topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com"&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/a&gt; had their comic idea for &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/10/29/"&gt;New Kid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; optioned to Paramount for an animated film. Congrats guys! Another step in the future of online comics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dccomics.com/dccomics/"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt; is bringing out the retcon again. Not only for a few series, but the whole universe for a more &amp;#8220;modern&amp;#8221; feel. Did we mention they are moving to a day and date release as well?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android Marketplace has shut down all game emulators. While nothing illegal about them, are they just trying to avoid issues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many times DO you have to buy &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;? How broken is our consumer market when it comes to new media?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ea.com/"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt; has opened up their own download marketplace called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://store.origin.com/"&gt;Origin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. How are they going to survive against something like &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More divisions of Sony have been hacked. I&amp;#8217;d give some more commentary, but really, are they going to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China says that the United States are waging an Internet war.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Elite&lt;/em&gt;. Let&amp;#8217;s pay for things that Bungie has been offering for free. Capitalism at work folks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World Health Organization (WHO) says that cell phones are &amp;#8220;possibly&amp;#8221; carcinogenic. Don&amp;#8217;t take this at face value. Know your science guys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>This week we had to record a day early due to my decision to go to a Death Cab for Cutie concert on our usual recording day. Amber Neely joins us to make up for my decision to make social with the real world apparently. While being mocked extraneously and being teased as a hipster before and after our recording ended, we were able to cut out my tears in order to bring you yet another episode of 20 sides of Nerd.  Topics covered include Skype's outage, a review of the Jackback for the iPhone 4, Monday Night Combat, Conduit 2's review response, Lady GaGa's $1.00 album promotion, and Chinese prisoners farming World of Warcraft gold.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week we had to record a day early due to my decision to go to a Death Cab for Cutie concert on our usual recording day. &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/_ruga"&gt;Amber Neely&lt;/a&gt; joins us to make up for my decision to make social with the real world apparently. While being mocked extraneously and being teased as a hipster before and after our recording ended, we were able to cut out my tears in order to bring you yet another episode of 20 sides of Nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hastily gathered topic list this week covered (after my tears were edited out):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skype.com"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; had a small outage. Folks, it wasn&amp;#8217;t &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; fault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 8 is coming in 2012.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee gives a review for &lt;a href="http://www.jackbacks.com/pages/frontpage"&gt;JackBacks&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone 4. Thumbs up from him.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uberent.com/"&gt;Monday Night Combat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; servers are a little low on population for PC. Why aren&amp;#8217;t you playing?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conduit 2&lt;/em&gt; reviews lead to High Voltage Software retaliating against the reviewer via his book on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Really folks? Are we school kids again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the way games are reviewed outdated? Why do we feel a need to rank them rather than just say &amp;#8216;yes&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;no&amp;#8217;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sony.com"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; is still getting hacked. This time it is covering more of their business. Can we get this fix yet guys?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady GaGa broke Amazon through her $0.99 album promotion of &lt;em&gt;Born This Way&lt;/em&gt; on the album&amp;#8217;s release day. This is what we&amp;#8217;ve been saying should happen, minus breaking the distributor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emdee and I reminisce on our college radio experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prisoner speaks out about being forced to farm gold in &lt;a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; while in jail. While is sounds terrible, is that really even a punishment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malware popping up on the Mac again. Apple ignores the problem until they push a patch. Macs are not invulnerable, they are susceptible just like any PC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amber tells us about her experience with the Serenity RPG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks! (The concert was good too in case you were wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>This week we had to record a day early due to my decision to go to a Death Cab for Cutie concert on our usual recording day. Amber Neely joins us to make up for my decision to make social with the real world apparently. While being mocked extraneously and being teased as a hipster before and after our recording ended, we were able to cut out my tears in order to bring you yet another episode of 20 sides of Nerd.  Topics covered include Skype's outage, a review of the Jackback for the iPhone 4, Monday Night Combat, Conduit 2's review response, Lady GaGa's $1.00 album promotion, and Chinese prisoners farming World of Warcraft gold.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>Now that we're all still around it seems that you'll be blessed with another episode of the podcast this week. Between stocking our emergency bunkers and fortifying our homes, we found the time to record yet another one for you folks. We thought, why not be loyal to our fans? Those left behind could listen to one last episode as they fought on against the horde. My good friend Anpu in joined this week for perhaps the last tech week for mankind. In the end, we wrapped a successful cast, cooked a steak, and put all of our demon fighting weapons away. Thinking about it now, I guess I didn't need to get those warding tattoos as a last minute thing on Saturday.  Topics covered include college grads moving back home, the tenth anniversary of Apple retail stores, zero day patches, Lionhead and the used game market, Valve and player's real world value, the continued PSN debacle, and the iOS effect on the entire game industry.</description>

Between stocking our emergency bunkers and fortifying our homes, we found the time to record yet another one for you folks. We thought, why not be loyal to our fans? Those left behind could listen to one last episode as they fought on against the horde. My good friend Anpu in joined this week for perhaps the last tech week for mankind. In the end, we wrapped a successful cast, cooked a steak, and put all of our demon fighting weapons away. Thinking about it now, I guess I didn&amp;#8217;t need to get those warding tattoos as a last minute thing on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics for this week as we thought on to the less crowded streets ahead of us consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large number of college grads moving back home. Make sure you thank your parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tenth anniversary of the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple &lt;/a&gt;retail store. Congrats on ten years of crushing the little guy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero Day patches &amp;#8211; Why can&amp;#8217;t games just be finished when they are released? Don&amp;#8217;t companies realize that releasing a broken product will hurt sales? People will wait for good games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lionhead.com"&gt;Lionhead&lt;/a&gt; says that the pre-owned game market is worse for them than piracy. WHAT?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anpu REALLY hates the fantasy genre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gabe Newell of Valve toys with the idea of a &amp;#8220;real world value&amp;#8221; on players. Are you annoying over voice chat? Do you grief people all the time? Be prepared to pay more money. Gabe, you&amp;#8217;re welcome for the $5 idea too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playstation Network &amp;#8211; Congratulations, you didn&amp;#8217;t actually fix your service!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://hellgate.t3fun.com/intro.html"&gt;Hellgate: London&lt;/a&gt; is making its way back to the States as a free to play MMO. A great game gets a new life. Will micro transactions bring this game a new life like it has others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dennis Dyack says iOS and other mobile apps are hurting the gaming industry. Uh&amp;#8230;ok? Are you sure about that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Executing our masterful plans as always, we were able to abduct Sarsion of Whisper Game Studios from his out of his bed at the crack of dawn. Our stalwart 20 Sides of Nerd crew, augmented with our getaway driver Das Kalk puts on a rather meandering podcast as we held him ransom. Figuring out that Sarsion was more trouble than he was worth, we lowered our demands to something a little more obtainable.  Topics include Soul Calibur V, Microsoft's purchase of Skype, swag bags, SyFy's lack of genre television, Red Faction Guerrilla, Google Music, and Fox's treatment of their television shows.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Executing our masterful plans as always, we were able to abduct &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JohnDowdles/"&gt;Sarsion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.whispergamestudios.com/"&gt;Whisper Game Studios&lt;/a&gt; from his out of his bed at the crack of dawn. Our stalwart 20 Sides of Nerd crew, augmented with our getaway driver &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ScottWBradford"&gt;Das Kalk&lt;/a&gt;, puts on a rather meandering podcast as we held him ransom. Figuring out that Sarsion was more trouble than he was worth, we lowered our demands to something a little more obtainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had to listen with fake enthusiasm and gleefully chime in on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; buys &lt;a href="http://www.skype.com"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; We knew change was coming, but how much?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul Calibur V&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; What is the deal with that &lt;a href="http://kotaku.com/5800379/strict-regulations-govern-the-breasts-of-soul-calibur"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;? Is there still a market for fighting games?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swag bags and items from conventions (Thank you for your fabulous bags &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Fighter Online&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Emdee hates Syfy&amp;#8217;s lack of genre television.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endless love for &lt;em&gt;Red Faction: Guerrilla&lt;/em&gt; (Should we be scared for &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt; then? Syfy involvement!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google IO &amp;#8211; Music is now in beta! &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is bring more things to the cloud, along with business and education laptops in which to access it with. &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; PR grudge against Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My hatred of Fox&amp;#8217;s treatment of shows. Two shows I liked canned (&lt;em&gt;Human Target&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking In&lt;/em&gt;) to make room for more bad shows. &lt;em&gt;Glee&lt;/em&gt; is still on?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to drop by &lt;a href="http://www.whispergamestudios.com/"&gt;Whisper Game Studios&lt;/a&gt;, follow them on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Elysia_XBLIG/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or check out their trailer for &lt;em&gt;Elysia&lt;/em&gt; below!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>here I sat, staring at 6 booster packs of Magic: The Gathering cards; three boosters from the Scars of Mirrodin series, and 3 booster packs from the upcoming New Phyrexia series.  Inside Collector’s Corner, in Midland Michigan, I am sitting at a table with four other people:  Karl (an unbelievably lanky character and long time friend), Steve (a college friend who could pass as my doppelganger), Ramzy (a California native I just met), and Lee (a long time friend of Steve’s and the reason we are there.  It is roughly 12:30 A.M. and Karl, Steve and I had just driven two hours from our home town for this event. We are wired on Monster’s and ready to get our geek on.  As the last of the booster packs are handed out we are told we will have thirty-five minutes to construct a deck of at least 40 cards.  We are given the OK and the timer starts.    I tear open my boosters and begin sorting. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There I sat, staring at 6 booster packs of Magic: The Gathering cards; three boosters from the Scars of Mirrodin series, and 3 booster packs from the upcoming New Phyrexia series.  Inside Collector’s Corner, in Midland Michigan, I am sitting at a table with four other people:  Karl (an unbelievably lanky character and long time friend), Steve (a college friend who could pass as my doppelganger), Ramzy (a California native I just met), and Lee (a long time friend of Steve’s and the reason we are there.  It is roughly 12:30 A.M. and Karl, Steve and I had just driven two hours from our home town for this event. We are wired on Monster’s and ready to get our geek on.  As the last of the booster packs are handed out we are told we will have thirty-five minutes to construct a deck of at least 40 cards.  We are given the OK and the timer starts.    I tear open my boosters and begin sorting. &lt;span id="more-88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; My mind is racing trying to memorize each card as I separate them into piles by color.  My thought process tells me that I should build a deck based on the cards I have the most of, and as I finish separating I find that I have a lot of White, Black, and Artifacts.  At this point I am both happy and disappointed.  Happy that I have the colors/card types that I feel most comfortable using, and disappointed that the one card I was hoping to pull, remained elusive. I begin searching through my cards and trying to craft the best possible deck.  I know I need a “bomb”, a high-cost creature that, once summoned, should tip the scales heavily in my favor. I find a “Geth, Lord of the Vault”, whose ability allows me to resurrect creatures from my opponent’s graveyard and place onto the battlefield under my control.  I also find a “Shattered Angel”, which lets me gain 3 life every time my opponent plays a Land card.  I decide to run a white/black deck and continue picking the best cards from what I have available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finish building with about five minutes left, and look around the table.  Karl has a face of complete concentration, Steve looks satisfied, Lee has a big grin on his face (bad news) and Ramzy…Ramzy pulled the one card I was hoping to get, “Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite”, lucky bastard.  As the clock winds down I begin to re-think my deck.  It looks sloppy and thrown together, granted that is the point of these types of tournaments, but I would like to win at least one round and prove that I am not a complete noob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock strikes 1:00 A.M. and the first round roster goes up.  I head out to find my table and opponent, a nice but quiet guy by the name of Andrew.  We shuffle, cut, and the game begins.  Andrew goes first and he plays fast.  It throws me off and makes me second guess myself, I make a few rookie mistakes but end up winning the first game.  We re-shuffle, re-set and play again.  This time he bowls me over and takes an easy win.  1-1, we have to play a tie-breaker game.  We begin again and I seem to have pulled the perfect hand; the right amount of mana, my “bomb” and a couple low-cost creatures.  This could work.  We begin trading blows and spells back and forth, but I notice that after a few turns he stops attacking.  He has plenty of mana, and a hand of at least 5 cards.  I begin thinking that he is waiting for me to cast my Geth so that he can counter it and then proceed to clean me out.  But as I cast it, nothing happens and he begins to get frustrated.  He is running a red/green/black deck and cannot get any green mana.  After a few turns, he concedes defeat, not out of anger but it is clear that he will lose during the next turn.  We shake hands, report the outcome to the owner of the store, and wait for the next round.  Winning essentially by default doesn’t feel great, but it is still nice to know that my deck isn’t completely worthless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next round I faced off against a younger player who had about as much experience as I did. He was running a black and blue deck, which was built to stave off attacks from my larger creatures, while he amassed his own army and slowly tried poison me with unblockable creatures.  We were pretty evenly matched, but I managed to win two games in a row.  The deck I had thought was sloppy had now gotten me through two rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point it was nearing 3:00 A.M., we had only finished 2 of the 6 rounds and I had been up for almost 21 hours. I can’t lie, I was tired.  While getting some fresh air between rounds, the roster for round three was put up.  I was to play against Lee.  Fuck.  Lee is a walking encyclopedia for Magic, and a tough competitor.  Luckily he is a happy-go-lucky type of person so even if he slaughters you, you still have fun.  I did my best not to underestimate Lee, for all the good it did me.  He started off both rounds the same way, holding back until he could counter my strong cards, and then hitting me with the same unblockable creature the last opponent used to poison me.  Then he would bring out the heavy hitter, Swarmlord.  At the beginning of his turn he would be able to put out a 1/1 Insect creature with infect for each poison counter I had.  After a few turns he had an army that I couldn’t contend with and he walked right past my defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now 4:30 A.M.  It appeared that the tournament would not be over before 8:00 A.M. and that would mean 26+ hours without sleep, plus a two-hour drive home.  As Steve was staying for the remainder of the weekend, Karl and I decided to cut our losses and bow out of the tournament.  I was disappointed that we couldn’t see it through to the end, but relieved that sleep was a mere two hours away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to see what other decks I can put together with the New Phyrexia expansion.  The new mechanic of using life as mana adds a cut-throat dimension to the game that I am really enjoying, kudos to the Wizards for finding ways to keep an 18 year old game fresh and fun to play.&lt;/p&gt;

We backtrack a little through our childhood sci-fi worlds, experience with dial-up, and our music tastes. Along the way we managed to create computer related furniture, as well as a revival and some new enemies for one of gaming's largest franchises.  Topics covered include the ongoing Sony outage, AT+T data caps, iMac sandy bridge Z68 boards, is the new Doctor Who too scary for kids, Brink, and community sourced character creation for video games. </description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/halcylon"&gt;Halcylon&lt;/a&gt;, graphic god of &lt;a href="http://www.bungie.net"&gt;Bungie&lt;/a&gt;, tags along with us on another weekly installment of 20 Sides of Nerd. We backtrack a little through our childhood sci-fi worlds, experience with dial-up, and our music tastes. Along the way we managed to create computer related furniture, as well as a revival and some new enemies for one of gaming&amp;#8217;s largest franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of topics we managed to stumble into along the way included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.starwars.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touching base once more with the &lt;a href="http://www.sony.com"&gt;PSN/SOE/Sony&lt;/a&gt; data failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS gets a patch for lessening tower tracking data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.att.com"&gt;AT&amp;#038;T&lt;/a&gt; caps for data usage has started for their customers &amp;#8211; What didn&amp;#8217;t they tell you? Why haven&amp;#8217;t you changed services yet? Are we reverting to the days of dial-up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New iMacs are launching with new Sandy Bridge Z68 boards before they&amp;#8217;re released to the general public &amp;#8211; Eat it me!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Too scary for children now? Parents in the UK think so. (spoilers!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is all this technology we use too normal? Giving locations away of fugitives who don&amp;#8217;t seem to have any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.callofduty.com"&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;Ecco the Dolphin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking forward to &lt;a href="http://brinkthegame.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community sourced character creation for video games and social gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

As you can tell he didn&amp;#8217;t have the interject that much, so we must have been civil enough to carry on. Fret not faithful listeners, we will be back next week for another bickerfest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics that lead to us ranting this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Cloud Crashing and You: Did Skynet take control?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSN Network still down (as of the time of recording)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenpeace &amp;#8211; Why can&amp;#8217;t we do anything right by these hypocrites? (Chart we speak about can be found &lt;a href="http://www.nextbigfuture.com"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; keep information on where you&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8211; Why this should be expected, but still not quite right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno&amp;#8217;s thoughts on his visit to the &lt;a href="http://www.stumptowncomics.com/"&gt;Stumptown Comic Fest&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, OR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crazed pitches us on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thinkwithportals.com/"&gt;Portal 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uberent.com/"&gt;Monday Night Combat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Again. Buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data centers and Apple&amp;#8217;s push to create revolutionary video content turns into a PC vs. Mac argument (Never saw that coming).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

In spite of that, we tackled what we could in the mystical span of an hour. Does an hour constitute an epic voyage? I'm not so sure on that. We could have used a boat to keep us afloat on the sea of phlegm that was pouring from Snorkle's sinuses. We welcome having him aboard, but unfortunately, the captain decided to cut him out of the spoils.</description>

We could have used a boat to keep us afloat on the sea of phlegm that was pouring from Snorkle&amp;#8217;s sinuses. We welcome having him aboard, but unfortunately, the captain decided to cut him out of the spoils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 Sides of Nerd was able to pay tribute to the nerdy gods by slaying the following topics this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Kindle for $25 less, but supported by ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenovo 23&amp;#8243; tablet &amp;#8211; What were they thinking?!&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Rising 2:Off the Record&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Frank is back at full retail!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why can&amp;#8217;t we as gamers accept a multiplayer game market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; introduces a subscription/lease model with CS5.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of having your own physical backup to cloud storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ea.com"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt; locks &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://dragonage.bioware.com"&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; out of single player modes due to a DRM error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>“You’re going to go see that right,” asked a friend as we passed a display on the way to our movie. “What, you mean that one with the rabbit,” I clamored as I looked puzzled at the cardboard. “Yeah. You love anything with bunnies.” I glared back at him in reply. Really though, just because something has a rabbit in it doesn’t mean I’ll automatically like it. It just improves its chances a little bit by getting me interested. In this case my object of potential admiration was a large display for the movie Hop. After I got home, I had a little talk with my other half. We decided that this would be a good film for us to both take our daughter to see.</description>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to go see that right,” asked a friend as we passed a display on the way to our movie. “What, you mean that one with the rabbit,” I clamored as I looked puzzled at the cardboard. “Yeah. You love anything with bunnies.” I glared back at him in reply. Really though, just because something has a rabbit in it doesn’t mean I’ll automatically like it. It just improves its chances a little bit by getting me interested. In this case my object of potential admiration was a large display for the movie &lt;em&gt;Hop&lt;/em&gt;. After I got home, I had a little talk with my other half. We decided that this would be a good film for us to both take our daughter to see.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There were two possible points that gave us pause about seeing Hop though. When I was told that Russell Brand was voicing the rabbit in it, I did cringe a little. There is a place where I hold &lt;em&gt;Get Him to the Greek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&lt;/em&gt; in high esteem, but really Brand isn’t the first person you want your child to hear. It was pinned as a cute, Easter themed movie. You couldn’t think they’d let things go too far, right? The Despicable Me team was able to keep Brand in line for his voice role before, so there was some hope it’d be ok. That ended up being a fantastic movie, so we let that one slide. Another possible point of trepidation was the fact it was directed by Tim Hill. If you aren’t familiar with that name, I’ll give you a second to go look him up on IMDB. Go ahead, I’ll wait. Yeah, he did write for &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rocko’s Modern Life&lt;/em&gt;. Click on his section for director. Yeeeeeaah, that’s right. He directed &lt;em&gt;Alvin and the Chipmunks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Garfield: a Tail of Two Kitties&lt;/em&gt;. Both of those happen to be two of the worst CGI-Live action combination films in the last five years. Again though, we let the feeling subside as our daughter did like those. In the end, the potential good outweighed the potential bad, so we took a chance on opening weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hop&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a world where Easter is as big as an event as Christmas. Every Easter Eve the Easter Bunny (voiced by Hugh Laurie) travels the globe to bring joy to people around the globe. While the mantle of Easter Bunny is passed on through generations of the most dignified rabbits in history, the next in line, E.B. (voiced by Russell Brand) is the son of the current holder. While the wonder and awe holds his interest as a child, he eventually loses interest as he grows up. Soon we find E.B. as a teenager, wanting to break out of his responsibilities to live his dream of being a drummer. After an argument with his father, E.B. runs away to Hollywood to try and “make it.” Along the way he runs into Fred O’Hare, played by James Marsden, or rather Fred runs into him with his car. Fred has been down on his luck since being laid off from his job. What makes it worse is he had to move in with his parents. Now they want him out. With both Fred and E.B. looking at uncertainty in their lives, they come together in an awkward fashion. They end up crashing together in a fancy house that Fred has been tasked to sit for, but things go downhill for the pair almost instantly. Fred realizes he got more than he bargained for. Throughout the film he attempts to get rid of E.B. to quell the hurricane that his life has become with his new friend. E.B. does everything he can to convince Fred to help him. Now throw in an evil chick, voiced by Hank Azaria. With his plotting to get rid of everything in his way to take over Easter on one end, while dropping hints to E.B.’s father that he can take over on the other, the plot thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story really worked for the film, even if it was for Hollywood’s attempt to grasp at another holiday tie in. The film started in a way that throws you a little as you think the focus is going to be a certain way. However, it wrapped up in a way that shows you what the writers were aiming for. Even though two people from different worlds are thrown together by consequence (or fate), you come to see that they are really looking for the same sort of things from life. Both E.B. and Fred are lost in life, but really just needed each other to figure out where they needed to be. Fred gets to rack up a few wins in his column and get a once in a lifetime job. E.B. gets to live his dream while being able to fulfill his duties. Even the sister gets what is coming to her at one point. Everyone walks away with what they deserve and you feel content that they did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I have to say that everything wasn’t a ray of sunshine in this film. My biggest issue had to be with the dialogue. In a mash-up movie like this, you would expect the things people are saying to be a little over the top. The thing is most of it wasn’t. Sure, The Hoff nailed it in his typical bigger than life fashion. Other than Marsden though, it didn’t seem if the actors were putting much effort into it. The best vocal performance by far was Hugh Laurie. He gave life to E.B.’s father with a genuine sense of class and emotion. He was a fantastic casting for this film. On the flip side of the speaking role coin, the biggest let down by far was Kaley Cuoco. Maybe it was how it was written, but she sounded like she was just on another episode of the Big Bang Theory. Hank Azaria was a close second. You’re a wonderful voice actor Mr. Azaria, but your performance was just ear grating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you get all into this idea that it is just a kid’s movie, let me tell you that simply isn’t the case. It brought something to the table for both children and adults. While there were elements and subtitle nods for the adults in the audience, it wasn’t anything inappropriate or off-putting for the kids. Brand was kept under control for the duration, but didn’t actually seem constrained by it. It wasn’t as awkward as seeing him on the MTV music awards in 2009. &lt;em&gt;Hop&lt;/em&gt; had something for all of us. It was a heartwarming kid’s movie for my daughter, it had Russell Brand for my fiancée, and of course the rabbits for me. What else could you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.20sidesofnerd.com/reviews/animated-easter-a-review-of-hop/attachment/untitled-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-69"&gt;&lt;img src="http://files.20sidesofnerd.com/uploads/Untitled-1-203x300.jpg" alt="" title="Hop Poster" width="203" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line – If you are looking for a movie to watch with your little ones that won’t bore you to death, &lt;em&gt;Hop&lt;/em&gt; won’t let you down.&lt;br /&gt;
Recommendation – Watch it in theaters, rent it, or buy it. I know I’ll be picking it up on release day. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shattering another week of vacant news, the 20 Sides of Nerd crew managed to bring you some entertainment once more. Our good friend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Leetum"&gt;Leetum&lt;/a&gt; joins us this week, in spite of his call out to work at the beginning of the cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a week of legal ranting, we thought it would be better to give you a little more to smooth things over. Topic list for the night was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;Amazon&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; new cloud music service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strange baby music covers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; anti-competitive suit filed with the EU over &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; not sharing their search database to make &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com"&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Federal judge that lobbied for the RIAA in the past is now hearing file sharing cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marvel.com"&gt;Marvel&lt;/a&gt; teams up with &lt;a href="http://www.starbucks.com"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; to share their online comic catalog to in store coffee patrons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rebelminis.blogspot.com/2011/01/rebel-minis-releases-raptorz-game.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raptorz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game and &lt;a href="http://www.papermakeit.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shuffler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tile set generator review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gamestop.com"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt; buys &lt;a href="http://www.stardock.com/"&gt;Stardock&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; Impulse game delivery system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in taking a look at &lt;em&gt;Raptorz&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.rebelminis.com/"&gt;Rebel Minis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shuffler&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.papermakeit.com/"&gt;PaperMakeIt&lt;/a&gt;, please follow the links above. They were gracious enough to give little ol&amp;#8217; us some copies, not only to review, but to shell out to our faithful listeners as well. Stay tuned for giveaway in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I summoned up the courage to step outward from my home and into the grand venue that is our greater Regal Theaters. While one may not think this anything close to a monumental task, I must explain why it indeed was. I had decided that I wanted to see Zach Snyder’s most recent foyer into the big screen; &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt;. As a man in his late twenties, the trailer had everything I could have wanted. It was a little foggy on the details of exactly what the film would be about. That didn’t bother me too much though. From the trailer I was promised cliché things like Nazi zombies and women fighting things out of anime. Not only that, but setting the clip to the fantastic tune of &lt;em&gt;Panic Switch&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.silversunpickups.com/"&gt;Silversun Pickups&lt;/a&gt; had me frothing for more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To sum up the gist of the film without giving too much away to the potential viewer, &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was to be a film about empowerment. The film opens with a rather misplaced introduction that leaves the viewer pondering exactly what went on. One is left to guess at what happened, but we come to find out that it has lead to an act of violence. In turn for that act, our heroine is lead off to a mental institution. To top that off, a conspiracy is developed behind her back (literally), that wouldn’t make her a burden on her step father any longer. From here Baby Doll, played by Emily Browning, leads a group of other residents in a plot to escape whatever fate awaits them. What makes that interesting is the fact that their salvation is through battles with nefarious beings to obtain things in a dream world. In these sequences the girls are given instructions by a pseudo mentor, played by aspiring one liner king Scott Glenn. The catch here is that Baby Doll creates these violent worlds to escape another dream world that she is in. Did I mention the dreams are initiated by a dance that is never seen? Did I also mention the dream world she conjures to escape the mental hospital is actually a brothel? Yeah, I didn’t get it either, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before watching, I poured over numerous reviews to get a sense of feeling of how it was generally accepted. In almost everything I read &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was being panned terribly by critics. Good thing that I don’t really care what most of them think because I was ready for a visual joyride. However, by the number in attendance, even for a late night showing, I could tell that perhaps I was one of the few who remained optimistic. Now folks, let’s just get this out there. If one was to stroll into this film expecting it to be a wonderful success of a dramatic exercise with concise, clear plot points and dialogue that would tug at your heart strings, there is a fair chance that you weren’t watching the same trailer that the rest of us common folk were. To expect anything other than a popcorn popping, eye candy experience is just downright silly. This was to be a purely visual movie with a very specific demographic. Nothing more, nothing less. Elements outside of what was being poured into your retinas were only there to move things along from point A to point B. There had to be something to fill the gap between the stylized sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To refer to this film as mediocre at best almost feels like an insult. Sure it isn’t going to win anyway awards for best dramatic actress or best screenplay, but I’d like to think that it was slightly above the curve. Coming from the background of gaming, I’ve grown to like the CGI enhanced screens we’ve been fed over the years. When you make something look like a video game, I can’t help but be enticed. When you take the sum of the film as a whole though, it is clear that it is far from the best thing on planet Earth. From a clear analytical stand point, studios kept this film on the roster for a reason. You could argue until you are blue in the face about Legendary backing Sucker Punch for whatever reason. Bottom line is they knew it was good enough to turn a profit. Had there not been evidence of a possible strong showing, we probably would have seen this film in the straight to video market rather than the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my book, &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was alright. Sure, there were numerous flaws. That is to be expected in such a film. To me it was rather apparent that Zach Snyder had formed this idea years ago. It was almost as if he penned it in high school and never bothered to add any polish before he committed it to film. Perhaps this is the real issue people are having. This was Snyder’s first original project. His filmography is filled with flicks that basically had a guide book that came as an accompaniment to the script. Had he been lost in the middle of filming &lt;em&gt;300&lt;/em&gt;, all he had to do was crack open Frank Miller’s graphic novel. Was there a scene he really wanted to pay homage to in the original &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, but couldn’t work it out in his mind? All he needed to do was pop in the original to flesh out his idea. That said let us all hope he learned something from this experience. There are miles to go for Snyder to create an all encompassing masterpiece of his own. We know he has the visuals down, now he just needs to work on what connects them. If this does end up being the worst film that Snyder ends up offering to the world, then I say bring on more beauty, bullets, and bravado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line &amp;#8211; A pretty film to look at that is a great escape if you are looking for something that requires no thought.&lt;br /&gt;
Recommendation &amp;#8211; If you plan on buying it, wait for a few months until it is on sale at say $10. Otherwise, rent away!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The end is neigh&lt;/em&gt;, glowed the text. The message waived in the sky above a single solemn man. Every day he warns the passersby of the impending doom before them. Each time he sees a new face, he tries to plead with them to look forward to their salvation. Not one would heed his warnings. For those he does gain notice from, most shrug it off as if the electronic elite would never allow it. The man preaching his vision of the future before the uncaring horde was speaking of something important. He wasn’t crazed or fanatical about his cause. He was an average Joe with nothing more than technology in his hands. Through his eyes he had caught a glimpse of what was coming. The Internet as we know it was crumbling. He knew it and we ignored him. Now it may be too late to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuse the doom and gloom speak, but I felt it was needed to convey the levity of the state of the Internet. The true Internet apocalypse is now upon us. Is this the end? No; far from it in fact. The idea of what the Internet is will slowly crumble to many of us now. Some of you might think I’m kidding, but just a short while ago a third horseman rolled into town. Famine came in to show us just what is in store for our wallets. AT&amp;#038;T strode in upon its decrepit mount, spewing forth the diseased ideals that would spread out amongst all service providers. The time had come. They instituted their plans to stop unmetered internet usage for their broadband customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oddly enough, this is something that each and every one of us should have seen coming. Telecoms have ever so slowly been trying to put a strangle hold on the internet. With War being the first to ride into town on a steed named Comcast, it was only a short matter of time before the others would rear their heads to bring an end to the way things are. Pestilence followed soon thereafter hiding under the guise of a helpful organization, the FCC. We shouldn’t judge these actions so quickly. In the end our lack of care is what is doing the ‘net in. We are doing this to ourselves. Sure people try to champion the cause of net neutrality and foundations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation fight the good fight, but it really isn’t enough. Quite simply, there isn’t a single entity that has the financial backing to compete with these corporations that are forcing changes. Is that our fault? In a way, as we are choosing to give these business the capital to push their agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who will be the final rider be? The one named Death which brings everything crumbling down around us? Will it be Verizon that follows suit to AT&amp;amp;T? They’ve already been hinting about their future data caps and tiered pricing structures. Why would it be that hard to imagine them follow the new business model norm that AT&amp;amp;T is creating? If not them, could it possibly be the government that would crush our last bastion of freedom? The House has already passed through legislation that will put a damper on net neutrality.  Sure it may attempt to fix what the FCC had broken, but how much more will it hurt? Perhaps the democratic Senate won’t be so quick to let it continue to fly. Can we blame it on piracy? Are people downloading illegal things the final needle on the proverbial haystack? Will ISPs across the country finally crack down on the people that use the ‘net for their own nefarious purposes? Will Microsoft step in and shrug at these changes once they are the gatekeeper to the super highway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our digital rights have been in question for quite some time. Anyone with a discerning eye could have noticed it from far off. It shouldn’t take a man to stop someone on the street to give you that hint of reality. With companies throttling how much we intake, determining which content we can view, and trying to feed us what is good for us, it is a small wonder that we’ve put up with it for this long. I can only hope that we will learn a lesson from what Canada has gone through earlier this year. Everyone needs to stand up and make their voice heard. The Internet isn’t just another cash piñata for telecoms and corporations to hit up. It is one of the few places we as citizens of the world can make our open voices heard. Don’t let one man fruitlessly try to inform the entire populace of what is to come. Read up, stay informed and speak your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we let folks know this isn’t the way it should be, I’d work on hoarding bandwidth like water and canned goods for the end times. Download all you can, stream all you can and play all you can, while you can. At this point let’s hope that the man with the message was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week started out in a lighthearted manner, but quickly became deeper and more opinionated as we went on. See the list below to see what we mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dukenukemforever.com"&gt;Duke Nukem Forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; delay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our first prediction was wrong perhaps? &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/fringe/"&gt;Fringe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was renewed for a fourth season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networks and programmers flipping out over &lt;a href="http://www.comcast.com"&gt;Comcast&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; iPad TV application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RIAA&amp;#8217;s claim that Limewire owns them $75 trillion in damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.att.com"&gt;AT&amp;#038;T&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; bid to buy &lt;a href="http://www.t-mobile.com"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; backed law circling at the state level for aggrieved companies to sue competitors that may be using pirated software anywhere in their supply chain and the complexities thereof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a night that might have gotten a little carried away, we managed to record another cast over here with the 20 Sides of Nerd Crew. Draeno was in an extremely happy mood, but insists it isn&amp;#8217;t because of drinking.

&lt;p&gt;In no seemingly apparently order, our topics included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wii case on the People&amp;#8217;s Court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draeno&amp;#8217;s report on &lt;a href="http://www.emeraldcitycomiccon.com"&gt;Emerald City Comic Con&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-classing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.starwars.com"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.startrek.com"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://halo.xbox.com/en-us/intel/titles/haloreach"&gt;Halo: Reach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Defiant map pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.torchlightgame.com/"&gt;Torchlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RPG elements infiltrating into other genres.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games we are looking forward to later in the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ea.com"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt; banning someone from their forums/single player &lt;a href="http://dragonage.bioware.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS. I really wasn&amp;#8217;t that drunk!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Chef&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamers&amp;#8217; attention spans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our issues with art programs.&lt;/li&gt;
