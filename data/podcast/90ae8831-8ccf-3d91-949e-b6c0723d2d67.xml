                    <description>The first 2 book ever reviewed on the BBS were from Dan, so speaking with him about his latest 'soft science fiction' thriller was a special treat

There's so much to him as a person that makes his writing so excellent, that any fan of his work is pretty much obliged to watch this interview we did via skype.</description>

                    <description>I feel blessed to have such a superstar on the show for this episode. Delia has written several best selling books and extremely successful movies. We have a great chat about her latest novel, The Lion is In, for which the entire story came to her in a dream. This is one funny and feisty lady, I thoroughly enjoyed meeting her and I'm sure you will enjoy this interview as well. I interviewed Delia 2 weeks before the passing of her beloved sister Nora.</description>

                    <description>Jennifer's debut novel is an interesting mix of factual history and fiction.

With strong parallels to Gary Kasparov's life, it makes for a great insight into pre-glasnost Russia, world politics and a woman's search for her father's "lost cause"</description>

                    <description>Stephanie is a true American sucess story. She took her self published book from a 99 cent e-Book to a New York Times Best Seller and a full blown publishing deal with Penguin Books

Her Story is one I equate to "Sex and the City" with Real women. Stephanie is a delightful southern girl and we spoke via skype from her current home in Florida.</description>
