We can plan and plan for it, but we have no idea what will actually happen in the end for any of us. Seriously, tomorrow is a hard mistress, and we have to be fluid to get through it unscathed. And even if you made it, don't get too comfortable, cuz there's always another tomorrow coming. Be prepared, be smart, but mostly, have fun, because we don't know how many more tomorrows there will be for any of us to put up with.

It's a brand new episode of the 23min of Ska podcast! Chalk full of great ska music! It lasts approximately 23 minutes. Bam, nailed it again! But for real, I really dig doing this podcast. I dig ska music and putting these together each week makes me a pretty happy guy. I've made my main hobby in life listening to and seeking out ska music (as well as putting out ska records, go check out www.GrandpasCasino.com right now!) It seriously saddens me when I can't get a new episode out, it really does. So thanks for bearing with me last week and I hope you enjoy this episode doubly to make up for the rerun last time.

00:00 - Threat Level Burgundy - C'est la Vie (This Too Shall Pass) (...and Then Things Got Weird '13)
04:45 - the Bandulus - She's Fire (the Times We Had '12)

Actually, it can't do that, it's only 23min long, that's far too short! But, I dunno, play it over and over again? Or pause it after a minute and wait and hour to hit play again for another minute. Something like that, right? All kidding aside, I hope you dig this! That's a fresh new track from the Delirians, I'm really enjoying their debut full length! Also, check that Rude King track East Coast, cuz Rude King is gonna be all up in ya in a few weeks! You best get out to see them, their live show is certainly something to behold, and they are some of the friendliest folks I've ever met!

00:00 - the Delirians - Get Up (Get Up! '14)
02:34 - the Freecoasters - Keep Moving (the Freecoasters '14)
04:52 - the Stiff Joints - Wish You Were Mine (Circus on Repeat '13)
08:13 - Daniel Flores &amp; the Rumba Box - Hard Man Fe Dead (Todo Hombre es Una Isla '12)
11:22 - Rude King - the Gift (It'll Probably be Alright '13)
14:43 - los Kaites - la Noche de las 10 000 Luces (Desde el Imperio de la Decadencia '12)
18:24 - Johnny Socko - Torgugas (Full Trucker Effect '97)

Yeah, there's a slight twist on them as you can tell as soon as you start listening. OK, yeah, they're all covers, you get that right? To be fair the first one isn't expressly billed as a cover, and the lyrics might not be an accurate translation, but you know that song. Hell, even fans on their own YouTube videos call them out on the similarity. This episode has been a journey to discover songs for and put together, hope you all enjoy.

If you never heard of any of these bands before, you're in for a treat! Also, if you know some of them, but not all, I'll let know right now, they all measure up to each other.

A bunch of great songs! Kicked off with a lost-ish/obscure-ish tune from Goldfinger followed by a song that I've never been able to shake out of my head from the Forthrights that I was shocked to find I hadn't previously played on the podcast. Then there's an older song from the Amphetatmeanies while I wait for their latest album to finally come out! Speaking of new albums, I've included a song from the Georgetown Orbits' new album that should be coming soon! Then we have the Screw-Ups, who are a great band, so check out their EP, every song on it is great! The Boss Beats were a local act out of L.A. that I got to see and I loved them, but they are no longer together, still the music lives on in my heart and on this podcast. We wrap up w/ a song that I've had for a while, but misplaced, so thanks to the A-OKS for being so patient, a great group of guys and providing a killer song to boot! I haven't done a song breakdown like this in a while. I usually refrain from it, as I find it a little dry in some respects, but I understand that not everyone wants to read my take on the philosophies of life like I usually put up.

00:00 - Goldfinger - Seems Like Yesterday (Meet the Deedles '98)
02:55 - the Forthrights - Lord I Pray (the Forthrights '12)
06:09 - the Amphetameanies - Life without You (Right Line in Nylons '00)
09:11 - the Georgetown Orbits - Holding the Key (Third Rock Steady '14)
13:45 - the Screw-Ups - Don't Care Much (EP '13)
16:44 - the Boss Beats - Foolish (III '12)
20:17 - the A-OKS - Anarchy in the Pre-K (Funemployment Benefits '14)

This episode and all episodes back to the start in 2010 are available at http://www.23Ska.com There's a lot of great ska vinyl, like a 7" from the Georgetown Orbits as feat. in this ep! Head over at http://www.GrandpasCasino.com so why don't you hit that up for some great sounds?</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Here's a fat bunch of ska, rocksteady and ska/punk to fill your ears with! A bunch of great songs! Kicked off with a lost-ish/obscure-ish tune from Goldfinger followed by a song that I've never been able to shake out of my head from the Forthrights that I was shocked to find I hadn't previously played on the podcast. Then there's an older song from the Amphetatmeanies while I wait for their latest album to finally come out! Speaking of new albums, I've included a song from the Georgetown Orbits' new album that should be coming soon! Then we have the Screw-Ups, who are a great band, so check out their EP, every song on it is great! The Boss Beats were a local act out of L.A. that I got to see and I loved them, but they are no longer together, still the music lives on in my heart and on this podcast. We wrap up w/ a song that I've had for a while, but misplaced, so thanks to the A-OKS for being so patient, a great group of guys and providing a killer song to boot! I haven't done a song breakdown like this in a while. I usually refrain from it, as I find it a little dry in some respects, but I understand that not everyone wants to read my take on the philosophies of life like I usually put up.

00:00 - Goldfinger - Seems Like Yesterday (Meet the Deedles '98)
02:55 - the Forthrights - Lord I Pray (the Forthrights '12)
06:09 - the Amphetameanies - Life without You (Right Line in Nylons '00)
09:11 - the Georgetown Orbits - Holding the Key (Third Rock Steady '14)
13:45 - the Screw-Ups - Don't Care Much (EP '13)
16:44 - the Boss Beats - Foolish (III '12)
20:17 - the A-OKS - Anarchy in the Pre-K (Funemployment Benefits '14)

Well, not exactly. The original episode has one song in it that has been swapped out for another. See, when I first made this episode I'd planned on using "Mr. Tragedy" by the Slackers, then I saw I wanted to use a different Slackers song in another episode right after this one and didn't want my listeners to have some Slackers overkill, so I replaced it w/ "Mr. Pink" by the Articles. This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that I'd just used "Mr. Pink" in a episode about a month before! Whoops! I didn't realize this until it was far too late. Then in the next episode the Slackers song I was going to use there got edged out and delayed for a while, meaning I could've totally done what I wanted w/o worry and not have played that Articles song twice... if only I had a time machine... So here is the episode as it was originally intended! 

the Toasters – Mr. Trouble (Skaboom! ’87)
New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble – Mr. Pitiful (Low Blow ’97)
the Stretch Band – Mr. DNA (Mashin’ Potatoes comp ’00)
Jorge &amp; the Landladies – Mr. David (Monobound ’12)
Pressure Cooker – Mr. Precious (Future’s History ’06)
the Slackers – Mr. Tragedy (the Great Rocksteady Swindle ’10)
the Smooths – Mr. Figurehead (Very Own Vegas ’96)

I'll admit, I myself can't understand why I've never included "Ghost Town" on 23min of Ska before, but I'm glad I saved it, it's a hell of a song to end this mix on! Looking at the downloads and page views I still can't tell if doing all '80s ska for a month was a hit or a flop, either way I had fun learning about a lot of bands I'd either never heard of before or had only heard of in passing. I feel I've grown my ska knowledge w/ this virtual 90min mix tape, and I hope that my listeners have too, either that or have had a fun jaunt down memory lane!

These bands aren't the heaviest of hitters when it comes to name recognition, but I assure you, they're every bit as good as any of the '80s ska bands that you're more familiar with. If you hadn't heard of any of these acts before, well, seriously, you're in for a blue beat treat!

00:00 - No Sports – Heidi (King Ska ’89)
03:07 - the Loafers – Bad News (Contagious ’89)
06:30 - Shot Black &amp;amp; White – Day In / Day Out (Understand ’88)
09:12 - the Army – Kick it Down (Kick it Down / Mr. Average ’81)
11:51 - the Burial – Sheila (a Day on the Town ’86)
14:08 - el Bosso &amp;amp; die Ping Pongs – Immer Nur Ska! (Immer Nur Ska ’89)
17:16 - Lou &amp;amp; the Hollywood Bananas – Wings of a Dove (Wings of a Dove ’80)
20:25 - the Trojans – I Don’t Like It (Ala-ska ’87)

This time I'm taking on the '80s. Don't confuse this with a best of the '80s kind of thing, it is just a bunch of great ska from that decade. Sure, it is a lot of great songs and over looked gems, so there's a solid reason to listen in. I've used a lot of the hit songs in other episodes, but there was no slim pickings when it comes to the '80s with what was left for me to pull from. I sincerely hope that you enjoy this little trip back in time, and look forward to the rest of "virtual 90min mix tape" as May continues.

00:00 - the Bodysnatchers – Easy Life (Easy Life / Too Experienced ’80)
03:10 - Skaos – I Love to Dance (Beware! Skaos is Appproaching! ’88)
06:12 - Bim Skala Bim – Bangin’ (Tuba City ’89)
08:50 - the Braces – Playing Darts (Ska, Ska, Skandal Nr. 1 ’89)
12:22 - Off the Shelf – Off the Shelf Tonight! (Made in Australia ’89)
14:14 - the Boilers – Brighter Days (N.Y. Beat! Hit &amp; Run ’86)
18:45 - the Donkey Show – Feeling Nice (Bali Island ’89)

Firstly, thank you so much for all that! Secondly, if you dig the show, please check out the bands that are being played, buy their music, see them play in your town, and let them know you heard them on "23min of Ska". Seriously, there's so many ways to support this show, but the one that means the most to me is letting the bands know that found them and now you're a fan of them. Keep on listening, keep on diggin' it, I'll keep on making them!

Not so much the very young, you know in the vein of "I'm gonna be an (/astronaut//cowboy//president/)" variety. More of the teenage "I'm gonna an (/artist//actor//musician/)" kinda thing. Basically, anything to fulfill our inner creativity and get paid for it. Or maybe because, by all costs, we refused to work for "the man" in a "cubicle farm" and become a dreaded "corporate drone." Maybe that was just me and all my arty friends... In the end most of us got jobs at (more or less) conventional companies, and it isn't as bad as we though it would be. Maybe the fear of adult assimilation was what we really wanted to avoid, and once we got old enough we realized, hey it isn't so bad. In the end I'd still rather be and astronaut/artist though.

Working overtime, filing taxes, trying to get back into the exercise habit.

Order succumbs to entropy. Learn to flow with chaos. When I was young I didn't know this yet. I built a house called "me" and had my limitations set by parental, social and religious authority. I grew up with out questioning much. But I also grew up sad, I was growing up a schemer, I was getting sick of myself and I was taking it out on others. I had internalized the limitations that were only meant as a safety rope and was now rebelling against authority in general because I let them define me. In the end I got better. I don't know if I grew up in the traditional sense, as I basically build a new suit for my personality, a new house named "me" and designed it with no limitations. It took awhile, but I got there, then I started setting up who I was and picking, as more of an adult, who I would be. It was liberating, but scary as all hell. Anyone who knew me in the early '00 and still talks to me are the greatest folks in the universe! I was a mess, going several directions at once and talking a mile a minute doing so. Allowing myself to think thoughts and experiencing things that I had previously deemed "not for me" was the best thing I ever did. Best part is, I'm not done yet, there's no end goal, this is life, don't imprison your self! It is ever changing, go with it, you'll reap rewards and me happier! In the end, I know who I am, I'm Rad Jose AKA Bryan J, and I make podcasts, please enjoy.

One moment I'm with my wife at the Veronica Mars premier high fiving Ryan Hanson, the next I'm home dealing with a hot water heater springing leak and sending hot water flying everywhere. Ups and downs, that's how life goes. But something is always there to get us though, music, love, stuff like that. We celebrate those things in our good times, hold on to them tight in the bad times, and in the times in between we get joy when what makes life worth living pops up. Speaking of joy occasionally popping up, for me Coolie Ranx is always a welcome addition to any song ever recorded. See, "Dub 56" was my very first ska album so the awesomeness of ska music and Coolie are forever linked in my head. This episode celebrates bands Mr. Ranx has been a part of and songs that he's guested on, believe me, it's all great stuff, I hope you enjoy it.

                    <itunes:summary>Friends, well actually listeners, but I do consider all my listeners friends, it has been an odd 24 hours. One moment I'm with my wife at the Veronica Mars premier high fiving Ryan Hanson, the next I'm home dealing with a hot water heater springing leak and sending hot water flying everywhere. Ups and downs, that's how life goes. But something is always there to get us though, music, love, stuff like that. We celebrate those things in our good times, hold on to them tight in the bad times, and in the times in between we get joy when what makes life worth living pops up. Speaking of joy occasionally popping up, for me Coolie Ranx is always a welcome addition to any song ever recorded. See, "Dub 56" was my very first ska album so the awesomeness of ska music and Coolie are forever linked in my head. This episode celebrates bands Mr. Ranx has been a part of and songs that he's guested on, believe me, it's all great stuff, I hope you enjoy it.

One such show took us all the way to a Rockford, IL skate park. At said skate park was a ska show that started at 10 AM and ended at 10 PM. It was glorious! 12 hours of ska! My favorite part was that every band was a bit different, traditional ska, ska-punk, new wavey ska, you know what I'm saying, right? Anyway, I loved it! After a more traditional band, then a punky one, then a more 2 Tone style band followed by a ska-pop band! This is what I'm trying to bring out on this episode, going back and forth all over the style map, but it all has that killer ska beat.

It didn't, in the least. But music, especially ska music has enhanced my life in ways I can't begin to count. It cheers me up when I'm down, it makes me dance when I'm already up, but most of all, it let me meet some of the raddest group of people I've ever known. From back in the day when I got into it, up to today, I just can't believe the friends and acquaintances I've made through ska. It really shocks me sometimes. But yeah, ska didn't save my life, but it really made my life a whole lot more bright.

                    <itunes:summary>I've never been one of those people to say that music saved my life, let alone ska music. It didn't, in the least. But music, especially ska music has enhanced my life in ways I can't begin to count. It cheers me up when I'm down, it makes me dance when I'm already up, but most of all, it let me meet some of the raddest group of people I've ever known. From back in the day when I got into it, up to today, I just can't believe the friends and acquaintances I've made through ska. It really shocks me sometimes. But yeah, ska didn't save my life, but it really made my life a whole lot more bright.

I had been involved in a weekly (sometimes twice weekly) podcast with my wife since '08 and had gotten a real handle on the ins and outs of doing a podcast. I had wanted to do a ska podcast a few times, but was never sure what I really wanted to do. An interview show? A DJed radio like show? Me and a friend talking about ska music, sharing stories and playing some music in between? I was also tossing around the idea of doing a music mixtape project/podcast based on the LA subway system w/ each color line representing a genre, but abandoned that due to its insane nature. Also because I knew that would never take hold anywhere. Then I was just like "Oh hell, I'll do my ska podcast like that plan, plus it'll be easier, because I won't have to know average times between red line stops for episode times!" How foolish, because as soon as I was getting started on the first episode I was ready to saddle myself w/ a time constraint anyway. At first it was going to be 15min of Ska, and it was going to be monthly. I thought I could keep up at that pace while still doing my other podcast. As I put it together I realized that 15 minutes would be too short for a monthly show. So I upped it to 23min and decided that new episodes should drop on the 23rd of each month. After I'd posted the first one, I decided that I'd been hasty, and that there should be two episodes a month, on the 11th and the 23rd. That would also equal 23 episodes a year (provided I always took Jan. 11th off). That sat well with me. After the first year I launched the facebook page and removed a lot of my personal info from my blog and made it the official 23min of Ska website. I also added interviews at the top of each month. This way I was still getting 23 episodes of music a year. Somewhere along that year I found that the idea of a show that updates on the 1st, 11th and 23rd of the month got confusing for regular listeners and a lot of them thought that the show was released each Thursday for some reason. So starting in 2012 the show went weekly w/ interviews, 2 regular music episodes a month and 1 special music episode a month landing on Thursday morning. In my idiotic mind the special (and sometimes bonus if there was a 5th week) episodes didn't count to the 23 song cycle. I'm an idiot, I don't think anyone noticed my stupid numbering system. Which brings us to last year, this is when I figured I was all "Eff it! No one notices that an official session of 23min of Ska is 23 episodes! I'll just go weekly, and the episodes that don't count (All '60s ska eps, the occasional interview, guest mixers, May Mix Tapes) will be obvious, and won't be tied to the calendar." So here, on the 4th anniversary of the show and the 5th set of 23 episodes is coming to an end. That's far too much insight into what I think about when I'm doing this show, but for my brand of crazy it needs to be there. Next week I'll return to start the 6th cycle of 23min of Ska, I'm already planning the May Mix Tape too, and hope that I can scrap together another '60s ska episode as well sometime in March. So that's at least another half a year of this podcast to look forward to! Let's hope by the time I get there that I won't want to toss in the towel, because so far this is a fun gig, and I've met wonderful ska fans and bands while doing this, heck I even launched a record label! Thanks to all you wonderful listeners, and tell all your ska loving friends! I really want the next 23 episodes the most downloaded &amp; played yet!

Sure, the English, Scottish and Irish are more free with their swearing, and the Australians have elevated cussing to a higher art form, but there's just something about American culture that makes American swearing so interesting to me. I only really remember my pops dropping the F-bomb twice while I was a kid, and that didn't happen until I was well into high school. The first time was when he couldn't find his hammers when we were installing new windows on the house. It is such a legend that my little brother does an impression so accurate that you'd think you're right back in the middle of a hot Midwestern day and the old man has lost his patience with his goofball sons again. When ever Pops hears my brother do the impression he turns red with laughter. That's what inspired this episode, good ole, hardworkin', Midwest American swearing! OK, fine, not all these acts are American, and only one is from the Midwest, but you know what I don't give a single one of, right?

                    <itunes:summary>Swearing, it is as old and American as anything else I've ever encountered. Sure, the English, Scottish and Irish are more free with their swearing, and the Australians have elevated cussing to a higher art form, but there's just something about American culture that makes American swearing so interesting to me. I only really remember my pops dropping the F-bomb twice while I was a kid, and that didn't happen until I was well into high school. The first time was when he couldn't find his hammers when we were installing new windows on the house. It is such a legend that my little brother does an impression so accurate that you'd think you're right back in the middle of a hot Midwestern day and the old man has lost his patience with his goofball sons again. When ever Pops hears my brother do the impression he turns red with laughter. That's what inspired this episode, good ole, hardworkin', Midwest American swearing! OK, fine, not all these acts are American, and only one is from the Midwest, but you know what I don't give a single one of, right?

The sun always rises from the East, never drink OJ after brushing your teeth, and most of all, you always double down on eleven (not to mention, always split on eights). Most other advice in life isn't worth the time it takes to comprehend the words others have spoken, but those 3 (4) hold fast. Don't doubt them, and use these facts to go forth and conqueror the world.

                    <itunes:summary>There are certain facts in life. The sun always rises from the East, never drink OJ after brushing your teeth, and most of all, you always double down on eleven (not to mention, always split on eights). Most other advice in life isn't worth the time it takes to comprehend the words others have spoken, but those 3 (4) hold fast. Don't doubt them, and use these facts to go forth and conqueror the world.

Not that I didn't like the area, in fact I loved it, but I knew I'd never get used to LA if I didn't give it a fair shake. When I did go home, well, I found it lacking. The thing is, Peoria didn't change all that much, but I did, my friends and family did. It took me a bit to get my head around it. It wasn't just a geographical location I was missing, but also a temporal location. Peoria, IL 1999 - 2005 isn't a place I can visit or point to on a map. Sure, I can find and go to the place I called home, but I can't go back there w/o a flux capacitor. Ultimately that's a good thing. Memories are as good as gold in the end, be thankful for the fact that you have any good ones at all. It's never the location, it is what you do w/ the time that you are there that counts.

Your ego is only scaffolding that eventually needs to be removed so you can shine, but you can't give everything away. We all need our secrets. We need that little part of us to keep inside our heads that makes us, well, ourselves. Remember that, remember your core, what defines you, it isn't anything that external, and it is hard to explain, but don't lose it. That being said... here's a bunch of cover songs for you! Yay! And yeah, two Operation Ivy cover, so what, they're both good, deal with it.

You have to go out and make a difference in this world. Don't apologize for the fact that the way to creation is always destruction. Get out there and tear down what doesn't work and build it up with something better. At least add something positive to this mess. This is the world, and it is cold and harsh and violent, and sometimes you have to react in a like manner. Then again, I never said you had to be such a serious sour puss about it. This podcast is one of the small things I do on a weekly basis to try and make the world a tad easier to take for myself and anyone who cares to listen. Destroy then rebuild or just add, but don't sit and watch the world pass you by.

Last weekend I drove about a hour to go see a great band play (the Shifters in case you were wondering) and it was a blast to finally meet them in person and see them play. Just the other night I went out with my wife for our 2nd anniversary and (as expected) it was great as well. All day long we all slave away at our day job just waiting to get to the night, which offers freedom and fun if we aren't too wiped out to take advantage of them. I implore you to fight that tired and weary state and get out there and enjoy some epic nights!

This is the turning point, there's just a few more weeks of outdoor time before you only leave you living space for transport to work, food or music. No more frolicking in nature for most of you, and if there is, not for very long. This is the time to grab a warm cider, step outside and enjoy it while you can, much like everything else, it is fleeting, so grab it now!

                    <itunes:summary>The night is getting longer, as well as getting colder out. This is the turning point, there's just a few more weeks of outdoor time before you only leave you living space for transport to work, food or music. No more frolicking in nature for most of you, and if there is, not for very long. This is the time to grab a warm cider, step outside and enjoy it while you can, much like everything else, it is fleeting, so grab it now!

The reason for that notice is that I’m talking to the Shifters, a great ska/rocksteady/reggae band out of D.C. and I wouldn’t want to cut them short or deny any of you listeners a thing they have to say or some of their music. It had to happen this way, and you’ll be glad I didn’t short change you. The Shifters are going on a short Southern California tour next week, so I want everyone to know about that too, and show up, and dance, and have a great time!

The Shifters Southern California Halloween Tour:
Oct. 30 at the Slidebar in Fullerton, CA w/ Chris Murray
Oct. 31 at Boars Cross’n in Carsbad, CA
Nov. 1 at the Tin Can in San Diego, CA w/ 2000 Tons of TNT and Ottly Mercer
Nov. 2 at Resurrection Ride in Los Angeles, CA

Also:
Nov. 21 the Final Blue Beat DC show w/ Chris Murray, Sammy Kay and the Snails

Yeah, I was in the mood for some 2Tone bands, which then lead me into a listening session of other more traditional ska bands from the era I like to call "before I got into the ska music". One of the things about ska is that it has so much riches in it, a lot of people focus on the early days with what was coming out of Jamaica, and some even on the British bands of the late '70s/early '80s, but there seems to be a lack of love for the late '80s/early '90s ska that isn't ska/punk. As everything else that has to do w/ ska music, I still need to learn a lot more about it! I hope that mixing that sound along w/ some of the UK's top acts doesn't offend your listening sensibilities.

the Specials - Rat Race (Rat Race / Rude Buoys Outa Jail '80)
the Selecter - Tell Me What's Wrong (Celebrate the Bullet '81)
Madness - Bed and Breakfast Man (One Step Beyond '79)
Skaos - Oh Sally (Catch This Beat '89)
BOP (harvey) - Bread &amp; Circuses (Bread &amp; Circuses '90)
the Toasters - Night Train (New York Fever '92)
the Beat - Ranking Full Stop (Tears of a Clown / Ranking Full Stop '79)

                    <itunes:summary>I guess this episode is pretty self explanatory. Do I really need to post more? I've been collecting songs for this one since the first few months of 23min of Ska back in 2010. I hope it all hangs together well for you guys and you all enjoy it.

My Superhero - Don't Let Me Down (SKAteboard Music '95)
Frau Doktor - I Will (Dauercamper '00)
the Bashments - In My Life (the Bashments '11)
Roslyn Sweat &amp; the Paragons - Black Bird Singing (Blackbird Singing / Always '73)

The most we can do is get out into the world and enjoy it! Some of the bands in this episode are long gone, other have held on for a crazy amount of time!

Seriously, everyone, stop complaining about the world and get out in it, it is rewarding, and think of all the stories you can tell later on in life. No one looks back in life and wishes they would've done less.

the Boss Beats - Everybody Get Together (II '11)
the Snails - Death Caught Me (At the Underground Echo Cellar '12)
Pressure Cooker - You're the One (What She Wants '08)
Maskatesta - Simplemente (the Maskatonians All Stars &amp; Friends '07)
the Moon Invaders - Got a Love (the Fine Line '11)
Small Town Get Up - Donovan Bailey (No Trade Backs '13)

A lot of the original song choices weren't working together, the episode came out too short, switched out some songs, rearranged a few songs, the episode came out too long, switched a few more songs and BANG! the episode is done. In the years I've been doing this, this episode is the first one to give me a bit of podcaster/mixer block, I guess you would call it, it has sucked up far more of my evening free time than any other episode. The good thing is that all those songs that got kicked out have started to form the next couple episodes, so hopefully they'll flow together easier and my episode description won't seem so cranky because I won't be so sleepy! I still say it is a fine fine episode of the show, but birthing this baby took far too much time!

Sunny Side Up - Corporate Control (Paradise in the Sky '13)
Stop the Presses - Daddy Issues Vol. II (eSKAndalo! '13)
doctormanette - the One &amp; Lonely (the Same Thing Over &amp; Over '99)
Big D &amp; the Kids Table - Pinball (Stomp '13)
Attaboy Skip - Oceanside Putt-Putt (Another EP? '97)
Nerd Academy - Line 45 (Nerdicity '11)
Parka Kings - Cliche (23 Skidoo '97)

It's not to say that I'm not a techno/disco/pop lover (I mean, come on, I keep it (barely) undercover) but mostly I wanted some personality and that's what the ska and ska/punk scene gave me in my music. But, what was popular loomed large and to become party to that constituted a huge infraction to your street cred and cost you major punk rock points, that would be selling out. Not to say that some bands of the ska/punk variety never enjoyed some mainstream success, but it didn't last long before they were cast down like Icarus on their wings of checkered wax, to once again hang out with the rest of us. Thankfully, no not too many noses were turned up about that fact from either side of the stage. So here's to selling out, why it is no good, what to do about it, and why it never really mattered in the first place! 

Johnny Socko - Next Big Thing (Full Trucker Effect '97)
Five Iron Frenzy - Handbook for the Sellout (Our Newest Album Ever! '97)
King Kong Girio - One Song (Now That I'm Gone '13)
Less Than Jake - Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts (Losing Streak '96)
MU330 - Sellout Police (Best of MU330 '98)
the Holophonics - All I Wanna do (is Sell Out) (Third Wave Undead '13)
Reel Big Fish - Sell Out (Turn the Radio Off! '96)

This is the result of one of those searches. All except for Monkey, all of these bands were new to me! The Sentiments I found on elsewhere as a "suggestion" but the rest were all culled from a few days spent checking out various ska bands on Bandcamp.com. I certainly hope that site isn't doing anything untoward or ripping off those bands, because I think it is pretty great! Then again, any site that can give fans easy access to great music will always be something that I'm a fan of! Now, go forth and check out these bands and think about grabbing some more of their music for yourself!

Monkey - Hot Lunch (Lost at Sea '09)
the Sentiments - Please Stop Your Lyin' (the Sentiments '12)
Classy San Diego - Queen of the World (Last Call '13)
Tree House Fire - Around Here (We Try Not to Think Like That) (Rocket! '12)

Miserable Man - Rocksteady Beat (Meet the Shark '13)
East Park Reggae Collective - Love Radar (Three Stripe Science '11)

I really do! It's true, you're all pretty great! Now, I'm not sure how much of you actually read these descriptions that I write, and I don't blame you. Rarely do I impart some great blue beat wisdom, some ska secrets or the occasional rocksteady conspiracy, but it is a small outlet to contact all of you who take the time to read it. It's like that liquid soap you buy at the hippie grocery mart that has writing all over the bottle that you never quite find yourself reading. You didn't buy the soap or download this podcast for the reading, but isn't it nice that it is still there anyway?

Cartoon Violence - Vauxhall Nova (What Ever Happened to the Likely Lad? '09)
Bumpin Uglies - Morning After (Ninjah: Reggae Assasins '13)
2000 Tons of TNT - Tiger Uppercut (Reggae Mysteria '12)
Poor Jeremy - Dying Like a Fly in a Cup (Spare Change '13)
Catch-It Kebabs - 5 Years (Return of Kebabulance '07)
Squirt Gun Warriors - Lucky Hat (Lucky Hat / Give Me Something to Complain About '12)

A lot of these tracks are ones that I just couldn't believe that I hadn't played yet on the show! Sure, maybe it is a little too '90s, but don't act like you don't enjoy it! For most of the year (save May) I've really been pushing new music from established and emerging ska bands, so I just HAD to have a small dip back into what got me hooked on ska way back when (alone w/ a new song that is crazy stuck in my head!)

Bim Skala Bim - Start Again (How's it Goin'? '90)
MU330 - LA (Chumps on Parade '96)
the Smooths - Take a Look (No Breaks '98)
Kriptolites - vete ya (mueve tus pies con kriptolites '13)
Johnny Socko - Half Your Brain (Full Trucker Effect '97)
the Toasters - Freedom (Dub 56 '94)
Stretch Armstrong - Crackhouse (Lollygag '94)

It really gets under my skin. Also, the less knowledgeable the reaction the more it is going to eat at me. Last week I was proving to the hater in question that he was wrong about this show (and a lot of other things in general) and was taking the high road in terms of programing. But the week ate away at me, this is the reactionary, snot nosed, fuck off episode I wanted to make. It is my show, I do what I want and this is me eating my cake. Thanks for listening, if you love it, I love you, let's get drinks and dance to some records. If you hate it, keep your trap shut and stop listening to it, that's as far as I'm willing to compromise. I support ska of all stripes and eras and won't let you make me feel like a shithead dumbass because of that love.

Ones w/ non ska bands playing ska songs? I don't know, they're kinda fun. Fun for me at least, I hope they're also fun for you too. Put on your dancing shoes and get down to some ska inspired songs from bands that don't usually bust out the beat.

Dogs Die in Hot Cars - I Love You 'Cause I Have To (Please Describe Yourself '04)

They Might Be Giants - Boss of Me (Music from Malcom in the Middle '00)

The complaint is that they're not sure what band is what. So I made it easy for all them. Each band is singing a song named after the band. If you have any questions, it is right there, wait for the chorus to come around again! Easy, huh?

Dance Hall Crashers - DHC (Skankin' Round the World 4 '90)
Madness - Madness (the Prince / Madness '79)
Cartoon Violence - Cartoon Violence (Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad? '09)
Red Soul Community - Red Soul Community (Pump Reggae '08)
Let's Go Bowling - L.G.B. (Music to Bowl By '91)
Lone Raspberry - Lone Raspberry (Children of the Horn '96)
King Apparatus - King Apparatus (King Apparatus '99)
Attaboy Skip - ABS (Another EP? '97)

NOTE: As I was getting this together, I found that there had been a compilation released w/ this same concept in '98. I'm glad that there's only two songs on here that were on there, but finding that comp earlier might've made it easier for me to put this episode together.

I like being able to support the bands I love as direct as I possibly can, also, I like to support newer acts that just need that last bit of cash to get the record out. Here's 8 songs from 8 bands that I have personally thrown down cash for. Trust me, you're going to love this episode! No need to thank me, I'd've just spent that money on ska somehow anyway.

Big D &amp; the Kids Table - Shit Tattoos (Stomp '13)
the Shifters - She's so Fine (In It! '12)
Rude King - Remember (It'll Probably be Alright '13)
Something to Do - Man in the Black Sedan (Music for Fine Dining '12)
PapaFish - 1 to 10 (the Lab '13)
Uncle Joel's Comb - Better Together (Tubular '12)
the Loose Ties - Awesomer Than You (Champ of the Week '12)
the Scotch Bonnetts - Live Ya Life (Live Ya Life '13)

I think it turned out totally rad! Not too mainstream, pretty modern w/ some older stuff... almost as if I would do something like this myself... if it wasn't for my "give credit where credit's due" ways, I'd just pretend this greatness was all done by me on my own! It really is that good of an episode!

Why is this? My best guess is that the pre-mid '90s folks getting into ska were the kind of people seeking out new sounds in the underground. By 2002 most of those folks had moved on to find other new stuff to listen to as they were always just music seekers. What's to bad is that many parts of the US didn't have an established ska scene that dated back further than 1996, so there wasn't much of a scene to stick with it after the local ska band broke up or moved to a bigger city. It was also around this time when the usual discussion about ska went from "Ska? What's that?" to "Oh, ska? You still listen to that junk?" That last phrase is forever burnt in my mind after it was uttered to me by a girl in a comic shop in the Winter of 2003 as she was picking out a classic rock record to buy while wearing a Jethro Tull t-shirt, I knew this girl from punk, ska &amp; power pop shows. So, here's to the bands that keep the fire going through the dark times! Here's to the fans that found ska, liked and continued to support it!

Skapone – Men’s Club (the Black &amp; White Album ’08)
the Malcontents – the Greatest Contradiction (Never Enough ’03)
Pressure Cooker – Refugee (I Want to Tell You ‘ 01)
Masketesta – Tu Que Pediras (the Maskatonians All Stars &amp; Friends ’07)
Reel Big Fish – a Little Doubt goes a Long Way (Cheer Up! ’02)
Out of Line – Salty Sister (Channel Surfing ’03)
New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble – Brain Freeze(Skaleidoscope ’05)

                    <itunes:subtitle>Ska in the '00s soldiered on as more and more fans left the sound for something new. Why is this?...</itunes:subtitle>

                    <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/56/9e/35/23minofska/1400x1400_8228540.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here we are again, still stuck in '00s, hearing the bright sparks of ska bands that refused to throw in the towel, just because mainstream taste-makers did. I won't lie to you, during much of the early '00s, I didn't abandon ska music, but I got much more insular and into the bands in the Midwest at the time before moving out to LA half way through that decade and trying to catch up w/ the ska that was going on in the world at the time. I feel as if I am still playing catch up, but I loved my local ska bands so much I wanted to give them all the support I could, sorry world ska scene, I'm learning and making up for it now! And this concludes side A of the 90min '00s mix tape.

Infamous Jake &amp; the Pinstripe Mafia - Standing Proud (This is the Beginning of the End '03)
the Hijacks - Victim! Ain't No Alternative (Free Your Mind '07)

Hurrah! Now, the '00s were getting to be a dark time for ska music. Bands were breaking up, switching over to emo and rock and/or dropping their horn sections all together. It was sad. Luckily, two things were going on, some bands were sticking it out and other bands were forming to fill that void. Getting booked wasn't easy, ska was on its way back underground, but you'd have to be really out of touch to miss these acts. This whole month is dedicated to those bands in the form of a 90min mix tape broken up over a month. Enjoy it, let it take you back, it did for me!

Big D &amp; the Kids Table - Evil Girl / Angry Girl (the Gipsy Hill EP '02)
Cornerstone 96-98 - Eggshells (Cornerstone 96-98 '04)
Johnny Nine &amp; the Racers - My Beat (Chin Up '09)
the Homecoming Queen - Timmy Goes to Summer Camp (a Sound You Once Knew '08)
the Amphetameanies - the Devil Lives Upstairs (Now! That's What I Call... '06)
Squid 58 - the Last Fag (Dismantled '07)
Monkey - Voice of America (Cruel Tutelage '06)
