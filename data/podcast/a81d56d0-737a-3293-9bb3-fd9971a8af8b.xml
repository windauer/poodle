                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Intense was the word of the day at Whitecaps training on Tuesday and it was also the mood in the air as the players battled hard for over two and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were hard challenges, verbal exchanges and an overall desire to get the team over the final stretch and into the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 75 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; is a special &lt;b&gt;Tales From The Training Ground&lt;/b&gt; as we hear from Caps’ head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, right back &lt;b&gt;Steven Beitashour&lt;/b&gt;, midfielder &lt;b&gt;Russell Teibert&lt;/b&gt; and striker &lt;b&gt;Omar Salgado&lt;/b&gt; about a number of key topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the Caps’ three clean sheets in a row; the team’s current fifth place in the standings and playoff push; the intensity of training and why it’s important it doesn’t go too far; the upcoming LA game; the Julian Jenner rumours and whether there will be more additions before the roster freeze; and what are the chance [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Episode 75 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; is a special &lt;b&gt;Tales From The Training Ground&lt;/b&gt; as we hear from Caps’ head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, right back &lt;b&gt;Steven Beitashour&lt;/b&gt;, midfielder &lt;b&gt;Russell Teibert&lt;/b&gt; and striker &lt;b&gt;Omar Salgado&lt;/b&gt; about a number of key topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the Caps’ three clean sheets in a row; the team’s current fifth place in the standings and playoff push; the intensity of training and why it’s important it doesn’t go too far; the upcoming LA game; the Julian Jenner rumours and whether there will be more additions before the roster freeze; and what are the chances of some more homegrown talent being added soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that, and there’s still time to look at the Salgado handshake incident that had everyone in a tizzy over the weekend, and we hear from the player and coach themselves in full about it, expanding on my article on MLSsoccer.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Episode 74 of “There’s Still Time”, the AFTN Soccer Podcast, and we’re in a celebratory mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just because the Vancouver Whitecaps beat Sporting Kansas City to get back into the playoff places in the MLS Western Conference, but also because this podcast was recorded on the 25th birthday/anniversary of when AFTN first began as a fanzine back in Scotland on August 10th 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a special day for AFTN and a special day for the Whitecaps, who got back on track and finally stopped drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick over the bones and the highs and lows of the game and hear audio from both locker rooms, both coaches and a number of the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Whitecaps side we hear from head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalscorer &lt;b&gt;Darren Mattocks&lt;/b&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look at whether the Whitecaps should/will make any further additions to the squad before the roster freeze, the USL Pro town forums and Canada’s potential World Cup bid for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The blunderbus(s) is loaded. All aboard for episode 73 of the AFTN soccer podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your usual co-hosts Michael McColl and Steve Pandher look at the latest happenings in Vancouver Whitecapsland with a Dallas post game show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More home points dropped against the FUDs, that’s five points dropped in the last two home games, which is simply not good enough if Vancouver Whitecaps want to be a playoff contender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back at the 2-2 draw with Dallas, the mistakes that led to the visitors’ two goals and the inability to convert more than two of the 30 chances created. Who played well? Who had a game to forget? What’s missing and what can be done to change things? We look at all that and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear post game audio from both locker rooms. For Vancouver, we have some frustrations from head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, goalscorer and goal misser &lt;b&gt;Darren Mattocks&lt;/b&gt; and captain &lt;b&gt;Pedro Morales&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dallas coach &lt;b&gt;Oscar Pareja&lt;/b&gt; shares his thoughts on the game and we hear from rising (hopefully) Canadian star &lt;b&gt;Tesho Akindele&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to get some tweets from our listeners on where the Caps need to strengthen as the number one priority and a look at the heartbreak that was in store for the U23s in the PDL Western Conference Final Four.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s episode 72 of the AFTN soccer podcast and your usual co-hosts Michael McColl and Steve Pandher look at the latest happenings in Vancouver Whitecapsland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a tough week for the Caps. Three games, two good roads draws but ultimately only two points from a possible nine and slipping out of the playoff places was a wasted opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back at the road games at Toronto and Real Salt Lake and the inability to manage games, kill them off and come away with wins from a leading position. What’s behind the blown leads and the amount of late goals being conceded? How can that be turned around? And what personnel needs to come in during the transfer window to help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from our thoughts on the matter, we hear those of coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, left back &lt;b&gt;Jordan Harvey&lt;/b&gt; and striker &lt;b&gt;Erik Hurtado&lt;/b&gt; from training this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look ahead to the crucial game against Dallas at the weekend, where three points really are a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look back at the Goats’ slaughter. Chivas came into BC Place and left with a 3-1 victory but what was the main cause? The heat, Jordan Harvey’s sending off, switching off at the start of the second half or the inability to take their numerous chances created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear post game audio from Caps’ coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt; and Vancouver scorer &lt;b&gt;Carlyle Mitchell&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to the tough two game road trip coming up, we ponder what changes Robbo should make and discuss the big question of whether the current Whitecaps squad is good enough to make the playoffs as we look at what desperately needs strengthened in this summer transfer window and which current players should move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Whitecaps were back in MLS “action” on Wednesday evening and we use that word very loosely in case the Trade Descriptions Act people get wind of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may have been boring on the pitch but we have some lively post game chat about the match off it with guest &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenheimer&lt;/b&gt; from Curva Collective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What went wrong with Fun Boy Three up front? Were there any positives that could be taken from the performance? Too much rust or not enough Rusty? We look at all that and hear the post game thoughts of Caps’ coach Carl Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on from whatever that game was, we look ahead to the crucial Western Conference clash at the weekend with Colorado Rapids. A match that could have huge playoff implications down the playoff line.&lt;/p&gt;

Who has impressed? Which players have shone? And just what countries don’t I hate?!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps are back in training after their World Cup break and we’re back with our second Caps’ flavoured World Cup special podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear from &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; about what it was like to play in South Africa for the US in 2010, whilst &lt;b&gt;Bobby Lenarduzzi&lt;/b&gt; shares some memories of turning out in Canada’s first ever Finals appearance against France at Mexico 86.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading to Korea and Japan in 2002, &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt; tells us what it was like to be there as part of the Republic of Ireland squad and shares some of his favourite memories of watching the World Cup as a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, who talks Italia 90, what it would have meant to him to play in a World Cup finals and why he wants his players to have that chance to play at the top level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not all World Cup chat. The Whitecaps returned to training this week, keen to build on their recent good run of form but to also shore up their defensive lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chat with &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt; about whether the World Cup break will be a momentum killer, how to stop the Caps’ leaking goals and what it’s like to be a defender in this modern age of going down at the first contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to play you some more snippets from something that makes every World Cup complete for us, “quality” official and unofficial World Cup songs, including Canada’s official song for the 1986 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The waiting is over and the 2014 World Cup is underway. It may not have been an opening game classic, but there were enough talking points from the Brazil-Croatia game to keep most people happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have so much more to talk about than that in Episode 68 of “There’s Still Time”, the AFTN Soccer Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re bringing you a World Cup podcast with a very Vancouver Whitecaps feel and theme to it, as we talk to some Caps about their countries, the World Cup and their memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we bring you part of &lt;b&gt;Steven Beitashour’s&lt;/b&gt; conference call from Brazil as he tells us about life with the Iranian team, looks forward to their opening game with Nigeria and shares some of his earliest and fondest World Cup memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran get underway on Monday and that game is followed by the big clash between Ghana and the US. We bring you some thoughts from both sides as &lt;b&gt;Gershon Koffie&lt;/b&gt; gives his thoughts on the Black Stars and &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s time for some Latin flair as &lt;b&gt;Pedro Morales&lt;/b&gt; talks Chile, nearly making the 2010 World Cup squad and his favourite World Cup memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s not enough, Jay Duke and myself take a trip down World Cup memory lane ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Who can stop the mighty Whitecaps?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps are on a roll. Life’s a beach and that’s why we’ve taken this special quick hit edition of the podcast on the road and to the sunny beaches of California this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just one man and his dog, as Michael McColl and his faithful companion Predictapooch look back on the Caps’ win in Portland and ahead to Saturday’s final game before the World Cup break, away to Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear some audio about both games from Whitecaps’ coach Carl Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to hear what we’re sure will be our question and quote of the year in AFTN’s end of season awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sea anemones, starfish or hermit crabs were hurt in the making of this episode.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Cascadian derbies are very much like buses. Not only do you wait for one and then two come along, but they’re also much better when you’re on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re in a Cascadia Cup fervour right now at AFTN Towers, so much so that we are bringing you the first ever podcast to feature all four AFTN writers and podcasters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded live during Wednesday’s Whitecaps U23 PDL game, episode 66 of “There’s Still Time” looks at the fallout from Saturday’s draw with Seattle and we get the scoop and definitive answer on the big talking point to come out of the Sounders game from Caps’ coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With another Cascadian clash coming fast, we also hear from &lt;b&gt;Jordan Harvey&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; with their thoughts about what playing in these Cascadian derbies mean to them and how they compare to some of the other big derby games they’ve played in over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of that, the Vancouver-Seattle rivalry is really growing and &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt; tells us why.
&lt;br /&gt;
And there’s still time for the AFTN team to look ahead to the next derby clash this coming Sunday in Portland. How do the Timbers and Caps match up and who are the key players?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;After a short break to recover from the Canadian Championship penalty heartbreak, the AFTN Soccer Podcast is back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 65 is a Vancouver Whitecaps v Seattle Sounders postgame show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring you all the chat and locker room audio from the exciting and controversial Cascadia Cup clash at BC Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodgy penalty? Daylight robbery? Call it what you like. We do but the Caps players and management have to be a little more guarded. We hear from coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalscorers &lt;b&gt;Erik Hurtado&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Gershon Koffie&lt;/b&gt; and a despondent captain, and penalty conceder, &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side of the coin, we also head into the Seattle dressing room and hear from coach &lt;b&gt;Sigi Schmid&lt;/b&gt;, US reject &lt;b&gt;Brad Evans&lt;/b&gt; and well travelled Cascadia Cup veteran &lt;b&gt;Kenny Cooper&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 64 of the AFTN Soccer Podcast is another double whammy! It’s both a Vancouver v Columbus postgame and Canadian Championship semi final preview show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick over the bones of the Whitecaps first away win of the season in the 1-0 win over the Crew. Who stood out and what were the highs and lows from the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear some thoughts on the game from two of the young guns, &lt;b&gt;Omar Salgado&lt;/b&gt; and goalscorer &lt;b&gt;Erik Hurtado&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning our attention to Wednesday, we look ahead to the Canadian Championship semi final second leg against Toronto. Can the Caps overturn the one goal deficit? Will Carl Robinson go young again? And will Toronto play to their full strength?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re recording the podcast at TFC’s training session at UBC, so we bring you some inside info from the enemy’s camp and hear from Toronto head coach &lt;b&gt;Ryan Nelson&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to bring you a little bit of Whitecaps transfer gossip about a new South American heading Vancouver way. No names, no pack drills, just some teasing clues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two for the price of one, and since that price is free, that’s pretty darn good value for money if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFTN’s Steve Pandher and Jay Duke look back at the performance of the Caps’ smoking young guns against TFC in Wednesday’s Canadian Championship semi final first leg. A loss but a lot of positives to take from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is then cast ahead to Saturday’s game against Columbus in MLS action. Will there be any surprises in the line-up? Who steps up to fill the void left by the absence of both Kenny Miller and Darren Mattocks? Will the Caps’ end their road duck for the season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this chat and more, and we hear some pregame thoughts from the Caps two centrebacks, &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt;, and look at the rest of an eventful week in Whitecapsland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this chat and more, and we hear some pregame thoughts from the Caps two centrebacks, &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt;, and look at the rest of an eventful week in Whitecapsland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for &lt;b&gt;Predictapooch&lt;/b&gt; to gaze into his crystal bowl and try and break his losing streak.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 62 of the AFTN Soccer Podcast is a Vancouver Whitecaps v San Jose Earthquakes postgame show, and also a Canadian Championship preview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into May there were two monkeys on the Caps’ backs. They still didn’t have a win against Western Conference opposition and they just can’t seem to win that elusive first Voyageurs Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after San Jose, that’s one monkey well and truly shaken and one to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back at Vancouver’s win over San Jose and the super quick start that saw them three up after the first 20 minutes. Who shone? What led to them coming out of the blocks so fast? And what does the immediate future hold in store for this team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have audio from both locker rooms after the game. We hear from Caps coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, goalscorer &lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt; and captain &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; for Vancouver and two goal man &lt;b&gt;Chris Wondolowski&lt;/b&gt; and former Whitecap &lt;b&gt;Shea S [...]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look ahead to Wednesday Canadian Championship semi final against Toronto. It’s going to be a young Caps team that takes on TFC and we chat with two of them, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;Marco Carducci&lt;/b&gt; and midfielder &lt;b&gt;Bryce Alderson&lt;/b&gt; about the game and more.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 61 of the AFTN Soccer Podcast looks ahead to the game between Vancouver Whitecaps v San Jose Earthquakes. It’s the Caps’ special 40th anniversary match but can they produce something special on the pitch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at how the game may play out, what formation and line-up the Caps may adopt and hear the thoughts on the game from assistant coach &lt;b&gt;Gordon Forrest&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filling us in on all the Earthquakes team news and developments is San Jose Mercury News journalist &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/earthquakes/ci_25662765/former-san-jose-earthquakes-star-steven-beitashour-enjoying"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elliott Almond&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps are becoming the comeback kings. For the second week running they came from behind to eek out a crucial point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick over the bones of the 2-2 draw in Real Salt Lake. Who shone? Who didn’t? Were Robinson’s starting line up and subs the correct ones? And what will it all mean to the shape of the team going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point keeps Vancouver in 5th spot in the West. We take a look at the happenings for their Western Conference rivals this past weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to round up all the weekend’s Residency and BC Provincial Cup action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps’ fighting spirit was in abundance as they fought back twice to take a point at home to the LA Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our LA postgame show looks back at the main talking points of the game. Did the Caps go with the right formation? What about those early substitutions? Should we be buying a book called ‘Where’s Pedro’? What are the Whitecaps missing going forward? What’s going to happen now with the still dropped Nigel Reo-Coker? And of course, we look at the goals. All four of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear from both locker rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Darren Mattocks&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt; and point securing goalscorer &lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt; bring you some inside from the Vancouver side, whilst &lt;b&gt;Bruce Arena&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Omar Gonzalez&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Dan Gargan&lt;/b&gt; and a not very happy &lt;b&gt;Robbie Keane&lt;/b&gt; give us some LA insight into the result.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps’ fighting spirit was in abundance as they fought back twice to take a point at home to the LA Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our LA postgame show looks back at the main talking points of the game. Did the Caps go with the right formation? What about those early substitutions? Should we be buying a book called ‘Where’s Pedro’? What are the Whitecaps missing going forward? What’s going to happen now with the still dropped Nigel Reo-Coker? And of course, we look at the goals. All four of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear from both locker rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Darren Mattocks&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt; and point securing goalscorer &lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt; bring you some inside from the Vancouver side, whilst &lt;b&gt;Bruce Arena&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Omar Gonzalez&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Dan Gargan&lt;/b&gt; and a not very happy &lt;b&gt;Robbie Keane&lt;/b&gt; give us some LA insight into the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst &lt;b&gt;Rob Friend&lt;/b&gt; tells us what it was like to be back playing football again in BC and how close he was to signing for the Whitecaps last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to bring you the latest Whitecaps Residency news and details of next weekend’s BC Provincial Cup quarter finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen and Happy Easter everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The LA Galaxy are back in town to take on Vancouver Whitecaps. Will it be back to back LA wins or can the Whitecaps salvage something from this key game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bring you our pregame podcast for the match and what better way to get an insight in the Galaxy than by speaking with their play by play man &lt;b&gt;Joe Tutino&lt;/b&gt; and we also hear some thoughts on the game from Whitecaps assistant coach &lt;b&gt;Martyn Pert&lt;/b&gt; and captain &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFTN crew look ahead to the game and ponder the Vancouver line-up, how to stop Robbie Keane, the merits or pitfalls of back to back games and they take a look at the mysteries of the LA salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for a fun chat with &lt;b&gt;Jordan Harvey&lt;/b&gt; about getting his coaching career off to a winning start.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps travelled to a Galaxy not that far, far away at the weekend, just in LA. Although Los Angeles can feel like you’re on a different planet sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the stories of back to backs in this podcast. The 1-0 loss in LA was the Caps’ second straight loss but they have the chance for redemption right away as the Galaxy head north to BC Place this weekend. We pick over the bones of the defeat on Saturday and look ahead to what it might mean for the team this coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s audio from Tuesday first training session back after the game and we hear some thoughts from head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, captain &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jordan Harvey&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We talk about the time he was in charge in Ecuador for a month, middle east football and the Qatar World Cup, those tumultuous times at Cardiff last year, travelling around 16 clubs in Europe in 16 weeks and the comments of Andrea Pirlo on pre-match warm ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look at the MLS standings and take an early look at how things are shaping up.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps have lost their unbeaten start to the season and it mostly self inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado Rapids came to BC Place and left with a 2-1 victory thanks to a Caps sending off, a Rapids comeback and two wonderstrikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pick over the bones of the game and look at the main turning points, with audio from Caps head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, captain &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a deflated Vancouver dressing room but we headed into the Colorado one where it was a much different place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chat with Colorado head coach &lt;b&gt;Pablo Mastroeni&lt;/b&gt;, captain &lt;b&gt;Drew Moor&lt;/b&gt;, goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;Clint Irwin&lt;/b&gt;, MLS rookie of the year &lt;b&gt;Dillon Powers&lt;/b&gt; and two goal hero &lt;b&gt;Jose Mari&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look at what the result means in a Western Conference capacity and Saturday’s first Cascadia Cup clash of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The week always goes quicker when your team has won and you have another match to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps head into April unbeaten and set to face Western Conference opposition in the shape of Colorado Rapids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFTN crew look ahead to the game and ponder which formation and players head coach Carl Robinson will go with this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a better insight into the visiting Rapids, we chat with &lt;a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/author/Chris-Bianchi"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MLSSoccer.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writer and &lt;a href="http://milehighsports.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MileHighSports.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Editor-in-Chief &lt;b&gt;Chris Bianchi&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have the team coped with their own turbulent offseason? Will their impressive young guns from last year suffer a sophomore slump? And how strong will the team that heads to Vancouver be this weekend? We discuss all this and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The sun was shining so it was outside broadcast time once again as we bring you Episode 53 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; from UBC’s Thunderbird Stadium after Vancouver Whitecaps’ 4-2 friendly win over FC Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look over the game, who stood out, who didn’t take their opportunity to impress and ponder just how young the average age of the Whitecaps team was in that second half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt; was the two goal hero and we speak with him after the game about the season so far, the match itself, the pressure raised by last season’s heroics and ask him just how good could this Whitecaps team could be this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also catch up with FC Edmonton Head Coach &lt;b&gt;Colin Miller&lt;/b&gt; and chat about the Eddies preseason trip west, the players to watch out for this season, the new NASL playoff format, this year’s Voyageurs Cup and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving away from the pro level to local soccer, we talk to &lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to ask our listeners and twitter followers for a little bit of help in explaining Nigel Reo-Coker’s Marcel Marecauesque mime show on Saturday. What could he have been demonstrating to Marco Carducci?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to bring you a Residency round up from Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Houston Dynamo are heading to BC Place on Saturday afternoon in what will be a tough game for Vancouver Whitecaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFTN crew look ahead to the battle of the two unbeaten sides. Who will be the key players? What changes with the Whitecaps make? How will the Dynamo cope in their first road game of the season? And what Whitecaps will turn up this week? All this and much more are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re joined by two guests this week. Whitecaps assistant coach &lt;b&gt;Gordon Forrest&lt;/b&gt; talks about the challenge that the Dynamo pose and a man who knows Houston very well, &lt;a href="http://total-mls.com/category/houston-dynamo"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Total MLS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; managing editor and Dynamo beat writer &lt;b&gt;Dustyn Richardson&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for &lt;b&gt;Predictapooch&lt;/b&gt; to cast his wily paws over the weekend’s action. He’s 100% for the season, but after a toy picking calamity, which ball will he select this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Chivas v Vancouver Whitecaps. An uninspiring game that produced several talking points. And we’re here to cover as many of them as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 48 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; is a Chivas post game special. Michael and Steve look at all the game’s talking points from the two goals to the controversial first half sending off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How unlucky were Chivas not to come away with all three points? How did it take one sub to change the game almost single handed? And what happened to that attacking style and flair that we saw in week one and was promised on the road?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of questions and a lot more besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try and answer as many as we can and look at all of the Week 2 action in MLS.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps are hitting the road and looking to build on their Week One success against Chivas USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AFTN team preview the game down in Carson with the help of managing editor of  &lt;a href="http://www.thegoatparade.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Goat Parade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog and MLSSoccer.com contributing editor &lt;b&gt;Alicia Rodriguez&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alicia tells us about the busy off the field happening with Chivas these past few months and what we can expect this season from the on field product. Are the Goats going to be on the move and what will they even be called this time next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the danger men that the Whitecaps need to watch out for? How should the Whitecaps line up? Will Carl Robinson spring any line up surprises? That’s all discussed here and &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt; shares some of this thought on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Days have passed and the full impact of Vancouver Whitecaps emphatic 4-1 win over New York has had time to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Episode 46 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; we talk to Caps head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt; about his first win as a manager, the team’s performance and tempering expectations. We also look at the new post game training initiative he’s introduced and Carl tells us who won the fashion stakes between himself and Mike Petke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steven Beitashour&lt;/b&gt; then joins us for his first appearance on the podcast. The Caps new right back talks about Saturday’s win, the role the veterans have in the squad and just how good this team could be this season. And despite being attacked by a bee, Steven discusses why he’s not getting carried away by the thought of appearing at the World Cup, despite everyone asking him about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new, yet familiar face at training this week, with Residency alumni &lt;b&gt;Brody Huitema&lt;/b&gt; back from Duke University on spring break. Brody talks to us about his first season in the NCAA, the differences he’s found in the college game, how the Residency helped him prepare for his college career and returning to train with the Caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to round up a busy first week of MLS action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenny Miller’s brace, the South American show of wonder, Carl Robinson’s winning start as coach and his new post game routine. Is Darren Mattocks the new Missi? What about the replacement refs? And just what does all this mean to the Whitecaps for the season ahead? They’re all discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;First Kick 2014 is just around the MLS corner and with it bring us expanding our podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a number of post game shows last year, which we’ll be continuing this season, and we’re now also adding a weekly preview show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosted by &lt;b&gt;Steve Pandher&lt;/b&gt;, with a rotating selection of co-hosts, we kick off the first show in the company of AFTN writer &lt;b&gt;Aaron Campbell&lt;/b&gt; and Curva Collective’s &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenheimer&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s panel look ahead to Vancouver Whitecaps’ opening match of the season against New York Red Bulls. Who will play, who will miss out and most importantly, who will win and how do they see the game going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s all the latest news and analysis from the week’s events in Whitecapsland as well and some audio from head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;, along with a bit of a Vancouver season preview as to what we may see this year.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Preseason is over and the countdown to First Kick off is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps head into the new season as Champions. Well of the Rose City Invitational tournament and there didn’t even seem to be a trophy, but still….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back at the last game, a draw with Portland, what could be taken out of the tournament on the whole, and hear some thoughts from head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the soon to be announced signing of attacking midfielder Pedro Morales, a midfield battle royale awaits and only the strong will survive. We look at the battle ahead and chat to one of the players hoping to come through it unscathed, &lt;b&gt;Russell Teibert&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other battles out there too and one of them will be up front. The main man is &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt; and we have a long chat with the Designated Player about his time in MLS so far, his injury troubles and his hopes for the team for the new season.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;One week to go in preseason. One game to go till the Whitecaps lift the Rose City Invitational tournament crown in Portland (a crown of thorns in the Rose City?). It’s not over yet, but we’re feeling alright. Well, kind of. There still looks to be a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news of the week in Whitecapsland was the signing of young DP Matias Laba. We pick over the bones of that move, what it means to the team and the other midfielders in the squad. We also hear some thoughts from coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt; on the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back at what can be learned from the two games in the Portland tournament so far, against Portmore United and San Jose Earthquakes, and look ahead to the final game this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to listen to the fun chat we had with &lt;b&gt;Jordan Harvey&lt;/b&gt; after Sunday’s win over Portmore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chat with assistant coach &lt;b&gt;Gordon Forrest&lt;/b&gt; ahead of the three game Rose City Invitational tournament which kicks of this weekend. How has he seen the Caps’ preseason go so far and what are the hopes and plans over the coming week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of young players have impressed in the Whitecaps’ preseason camp with two of the standouts being centreback &lt;b&gt;Christian Dean&lt;/b&gt; and midfielder &lt;b&gt;Bryce Alderson&lt;/b&gt;. We chat with both of them to see how they feel the first month of preseason has gone for them and what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look over the Whitecaps’ Residency’s own trip to Portland that saw two wins and six goals scored over their young Cascadian rivals.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Whitecaps have headed for the heat of Arizona but we’re keeping it real (cold) in Vancouver for Episode 39 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a busy show as we continue to report on the Caps’ training camp. We share our thoughts on the completion of phase one of the camp but who better to hear from on how it’s all gone so far than Whitecaps head coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt;?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Carl joins us for an exclusive chat about what he’s seen from the players so far and what he’s looking for and planning in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a young squad on board, it’s a time for the veterans to really step up and one of them who has done just that is &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt;. Andy has been a leader in the first week of training, sharing his wealth of knowledge with the rookies and excelling in the fitness testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a chat with him about that gruelling session and find out what advice he’s giving the young guns just starting out on their pro football careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fitness Friday last week. We look over the results of the endurance, agility and speed testing and there were some surprises on show. One man that really knows his fitness and conditioning is the new Whitecaps’ coach &lt;b&gt;Martyn Pert&lt;/b&gt; and we get his thoughts on how the sessions went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still holes in the Caps squad of course and we turn to Twitter to get some thoughts from our listeners as to what their biggest fears are about the team as of right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for Steve and myself to pick who is our starting XI for March 8th as of right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Vancouver Whitecaps training camp podcasts continue and this one’s a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 38 comes to you from UBC’s Thunderbird Stadium after day three of the Caps’ camp and there’s been a lot of players eager to make a big impression on the new coaching team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We speak with one of them, &lt;b&gt;Marco Carducci&lt;/b&gt;, about pushing for a spot on the MLS roster and his memorable 2013 for both the Whitecaps and Canada U17s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear from &lt;b&gt;Omar Salgado&lt;/b&gt;, who looks fully fit, bulked up and hungry to make a name for himself in the first team after some horrible injury woes the past two seasons. Salgado has been one of the most impressive players in the opening day of camp and he’s not about to ease up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the chat of those others who have been standing out, there’s still time to throw in a bit of speculation about a new goalkeeper that may be coming to town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps are back in preseason training and raring to go under a new regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 37 of the AFTN podcast &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; comes straight from the training pitch and is the first of hopefully three podcasts that we’ll bring you this week from the opening days of camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at what went down in day one, who impressed and who looked like they still haven’t shaken off the Christmas turkey, along with a look at the new additions to the squad, including new signing Steven Beitashour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an exclusive chat with Caps’ coach &lt;b&gt;Carl Robinson&lt;/b&gt; about his first training session as a manager and not an assistant and what’s he’s hoping for and expecting from his squad for the whole of the preseason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardwork, high hopes, holes and hassles are the order of the day as we look at the newly announced official affiliation between Charleston Battery and Vancouver Whitecaps; the re-signing of captain Jay DeMerit; the three new draftees joining the two and a half old draftees; and the Andre Lewis saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the holes that still need to be filled on the Whitecaps roster and take a trip down memory lane with a look at what retired Caps players of old would our listeners love to have back in their prime to help out the current team.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Third time’s the charm, which means we’ll be charming you rotten with our third episode of &lt;i&gt;”There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 35 is a special Double D edition, as we look at draftees and dafties (look that up your Scottish dictionaries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daftie comes in the form of Camilo Sanvezzo and we hope to be making our last(ish) comments on the we(e)asel Brazilian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing and recording, the saga is officially still dragging on but from all the unofficial chatter, it’s a done deal, with the final financial figure still to come out. Whatever happens, Vancouver Whitecaps will be the ones losing out and the search is on for his replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caps squad isn’t quite threadbare, but there’s not a lot left on the shelves. They do have three new additions however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself look back on today’s first two rounds of the 2014 MLS SuperDraft from a Vancouver Whitecaps perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself look back on today’s first two rounds of the 2014 MLS SuperDraft from a Vancouver Whitecaps perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drafts are always still a bit of a lottery at this stage as we await to see how the newbs fare in the big league. At least the Caps have three more players in their ranks in &lt;b&gt;Christian Dean&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Andre Lewis&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Mamadou Doudou Diouf&lt;/b&gt; and we also have audio from the two first round draftees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also get the thoughts of some listeners on the draft and there’s still time to finish on the rumoured friendly with Bayern Munich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a listen y’hear.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Your eyes and ears are not deceiving you. We’re back already with another new episode of &lt;i&gt;”There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, we’ve not become a new daily show (although if anyone wants to throw some money our way to make that happen then feel free!), but it’s been a busy start to the year in Whitecapsland, apart from when it comes to new signings of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 34 is a special Triple A edition, as we look at assistants, assets and asses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself are joined by &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenheimer&lt;/b&gt; and the debate gets quite heated as we chat about the Camilo Sanvezzo transfer saga. An infuriating and embarrassing start to the year, that looks to finally be getting settled very soon, just not in the most pleasing way for the Caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That issue obviously takes up the bulk of this episode but we also look at happier news with the announcement of Carl Robinson’s new technical staff, and what it means for  [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That issue obviously takes up the bulk of this episode but we also look at happier news with the announcement of Carl Robinson’s new technical staff, and what it means for the future of the Whitecaps and the young players at the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also look ahead to the upcoming MLS SuperDraft, cast our eyes over some of the players out there and look at that age old chestnut of do you draft the best player available or draft to fill your needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for our new section &lt;i&gt;“Dreams”&lt;/i&gt;, where we look at listener’s dream jobs in football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, everyone has options. Just choose yours wisely. Start by listening to this episode!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just going to be a straight month by month and game by game review, as we try look at the big Vancouver Whitecaps and Canadian news stories of July to December 2013 and the issues arising out of them that will be important and talking points going forward into this coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at the big Vancouver Whitecaps and Canadian national team news stories of the past 12 months and the issues arising out of them that might affect the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the hope we all had in January? When Darren Mattocks banged in a 15 minute hat-trick in the first game of the preseason. Whatever happened to him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s laughs and tears, stories and analysis galore as we look back at the comings and goings, First Kick, winless streaks, epic home wins, more Voyageurs Cup heartbreak and the joyous month of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also controversies, great individual performances and the uplifting promise of the Whitecaps Residency and Canadian U17s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not just doing a month by month recap but looking at some of the issues as they affect the teams going forward and some of the unknown stories behind the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to split it all up by playing &lt;i&gt;’Spoilers’&lt;/i&gt;. Inspired by the classic &lt;i&gt;’Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads’&lt;/i&gt; episode, we ask our guests and the people of twitter what extremes they’ve gone to to avoid finding out the scores of games before they get a chance of watch it and nightmare scenarios when it hasn’t quite worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of festive fun for everyone. Have a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, it may be winter but we’re still able to play here in Vancouver and bring you Episode 30 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, AFTN’s Whitecaps and MLS podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite it being the offseason there’s still been a lot of talking points cropping up in Whitecapsland over the past week and there’s going to be more to come before the year is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat, but will the Caps be goosed when it comes to landing the man they want to be their new manager? Bob Bradley is the man who might be named. Does he want it? Is he the right man for the job? Bobby Lenarduzzi says he hopes to have an announcement next week. We share our thoughts on the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confirmed Whitecaps news is what players have been released. For the best or some mistakes in there? And do any of them still have the chance to be Caps when the new season starts? With 19 players now left on the MLS squad, the g [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Despite it being the offseason there’s still been a lot of talking points cropping up in Whitecapsland over the past week and there’s going to be more to come before the year is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat, but will the Caps be goosed when it comes to landing the man they want to be their new manager? Bob Bradley is the man who might be named. Does he want it? Is he the right man for the job? Bobby Lenarduzzi says he hopes to have an announcement next week. We share our thoughts on the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confirmed Whitecaps news is what players have been released. For the best or some mistakes in there? And do any of them still have the chance to be Caps when the new season starts? With 19 players now left on the MLS squad, the gaps are now very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to MLS matters, we pick over Don Garber’s ‘State of the League’ address. Not as exciting for us as in some years gone by but there were a few key talking points to come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current MLS season just won’t end it seems. With the MLS Cup finally taking place in a chilly Kansas City this weekend, what will we see? Don’t worry, Predictapooch is back to let us all know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sit back, let your googles hangout and share a pre-Christmas feast with us.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Episode 29 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast and it’s our first Canadian national team post game show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian women visited Vancouver to play out a pretty boring goalless draw with Mexico. We chat with Equalizer Soccer writer &lt;b&gt;Harjeet Johal&lt;/b&gt; about the game and the future of the women’s program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hear the post game reaction from head coach &lt;b&gt;John Herdman&lt;/b&gt;, captain &lt;b&gt;Christine Sinclair&lt;/b&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;b&gt;Erin McLeod&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO of the FIFA 2015 Women’s World Cup National Organising Committee, &lt;b&gt;Peter Montopoli&lt;/b&gt;, was in town and we speak with him about the upcoming World Cup, the turf controversy and the lack of professional women’s teams in Canada and none existing in the NWSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for a little Whitecaps chat as we look at Bobby Lenarduzzi’s latest comments about the search for the Caps’ new manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no real front runners having emerged in the managerial hunt, we pick over what we know, what we think of those in the frame so far and reveal a new high profile name in the mix that the Whitecaps are said to be talking to this coming weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst taking their time to get the right man for the job is a good thing, with decisions on players needing to be made, and the players themselves keen to find out what’s happening, how will the continued delay affect the upcoming trade window opening and plans for next month’s re-entry draft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more busy world of MLS, we look ahead to this weekend’s Conference Finals second legs. Remember them? With the help of our new special guest, &lt;b&gt;Predictapooch&lt;/b&gt;, we tell you who will be contesting the 2013 MLS Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chat about the new 21st MLS club, Orlando City, and look over the MLS awards shortlists for this year and the brief Whitecaps involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for a brief chat about the Canadian senior national teams, following the men’s latest loss and the women’s game in Vancouver on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So have a listen!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Episode 26 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast and it’s our first end of the season roundtable. Still feels a little premature that the season’s done and dusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself are joined by a couple of familiar voices in &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenhamer&lt;/b&gt; from Curva Collective and at long last our schedules aligned and we’re joined by long time listener, first time podder, former head honcho of the Southsiders, &lt;b&gt;John Knox&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the 3M edition - Mattocks, Martin, Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a busy time in Whitecapsland since our last pod and we kick things off this episode with the main talking point of the week - the Darren Mattocks’ mouth. Is there any love in the room for last year’s leading scorer and is there any way he’ll be kitted out in a Whitecaps strip next season?&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s Episode 26 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast and it’s our first end of the season roundtable. Still feels a little premature that the season’s done and dusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself are joined by a couple of familiar voices in &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenhamer&lt;/b&gt; from Curva Collective and at long last our schedules aligned and we’re joined by long time listener, first time podder, former head honcho of the Southsiders, &lt;b&gt;John Knox&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the 3M edition - Mattocks, Martin, Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a busy time in Whitecapsland since our last pod and we kick things off this episode with the main talking point of the week - the Darren Mattocks’ mouth. Is there any love in the room for last year’s leading scorer and is there any way he’ll be kitted out in a Whitecaps strip next season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From someone that might be leaving to someone that has already left - Martin Rennie. Rennie’s departure split the fans and it also splits our panel. We discuss where it all went wrong for the Scot, but there’s also some love coming his way for his turning of this team around, something that’s been missed a little in all the managerial hotseat fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that the Caps are looking for a new manager, who will it be? We chat about the expected contenders and throw in a couple of other names that have been rumoured to have made the shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we want any of them and are our options going to be a little bit limited by the infamous committee?&lt;br /&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
And there’s still time to read out tweets from our listeners as to who they would ideally like to have at the Whitecaps helm and show how up with the latest trends we are by talking about the TV show “Cheers”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d planned to talk about a lot more, but once we get started, the time just flies. So we recorded a second podcast and you can here that next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So have a listen and sorry about the echoey feel to some of it!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 25 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast. It’s “The End Of The Season As We Know It” episode, our last post game podcast of the season, but fear not, as we’ve plenty more episodes to bring you before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recorded this episode at BC Place after the 3-0 win over Colorado and before the breaking news we brought you on Monday that Martin Rennie was no longer the manager of the Caps, so there’s a few moot discussion points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps finished off their season in style and we look back on the game and hear post game audio from  captain &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt;, debutant &lt;b&gt;Sam Adekugbe&lt;/b&gt;, the retiring &lt;b&gt;YP Lee&lt;/b&gt;, MLS Golden Boot winner &lt;b&gt;Camilo Sanvezzo&lt;/b&gt; and in what was his last game as Whitecaps boss, &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon turn our attentions to the future and what lies in store for Martin Rennie and the Whitecaps, and speculate about Frank Yallop taking over the reigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to have a look at the MLS playoffs. Who do we want to do well? Who do we think will do well? And what teams would we like to see beat each other to a pulp?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen and find out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cascadia high came the Rockies low. A 3-2 defeat to Colorado Rapids sent Vancouver Whitecaps spiralling out of the playoffs and Martin Rennie probably towards the unemployment line, along with a lot of the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t really want to but we look back at the game that ended the Whitecaps playoff hopes and try and pinpoint where it went wrong this season. Can winning the Cascadia Cup and logging more wins, points and goals scored make still make it a success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still time for a look at what we want to see in the last game of the season and we start our campaign to get both Joe Cannon and Sam Adekugbe some playing time in the season finale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more chat too about all things Whitecaps, including some tweets from our listeners about the season past and future, so crank us up.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 23 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast. We really wish it was 41 as we have the numbers 4 and 1 firmly implanted in our head right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very jubilant podcasting crew this episode in the wake of the demolition handed out by Vancouver Whitecaps to Seattle Sounders in Cascadia Cup action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look back on the game, dissect the goals and ask where that performance has been for most of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a team performance but there were also some magnificent individual efforts and we take a look at the play of Kekuta Manneh, Daigo Kobayashi, David Ousted and Jun Marques Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear some post game thoughts of &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Nigel Reo-Coker&lt;/b&gt; on the performance, the win and the team’s playoff hopes and the three of them also chat with us, along with &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, on whether the upcoming ten day break between matches will benefit or hinder the Caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look ahead to Colorado and try and break down what could play out in an exciting run in with four teams jostling for two MLS playoff spots.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 22 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast. An apt number for the episode as this is a post game pod following Vancouver Whitecaps’ entertaining, yet disappointing, 2-2 draw with Portland Timbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at BC Place after the game, we pick over the bones of a game which saw four great goals, a stirring fightback from the Caps, but ultimately did nothing to aid Vancouver’s ever decreasing playoff hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chat about the game, the line up and the goals and hear audio from &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; and  &lt;b&gt;Jay DeMerit&lt;/b&gt; from the Whitecaps end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also head into enemy territory and speak with Portland’s &lt;b&gt;Will Johnson&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Donovan Ricketts&lt;/b&gt; and boss &lt;b&gt;Caleb Porter&lt;/b&gt;. Some interesting comments from all three of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning our attention back to the Caps, we once again ask the question, is there still some hope left? It’s still a little and we look at the scenarios that need to play out to see Vancouver make it to the postseason, as unlikely as that may seem just now. As we chat through them you can share the pain of us as the full scale of what is needed become all to evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to read out some tweets from our listeners in our first interactive section of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No cats or wives were harmed in the making of this broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 21 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast, is a post game pod following Vancouver Whitecaps’ miserable 1-0 loss to Real Salt Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at BC Place after the game, we pick over the bones of the Caps’ playoff carcass. What went wrong? Why couldn’t we beat a reserve team? And who needs to shoulder the blame?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear audio from &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt; and some very honest and sadly accurate post game comments from a clearly dejected and frustrated &lt;b&gt;Nigel Reo-Coker&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also head into enemy territory and have a chat with &lt;b&gt;Jason Kreis&lt;/b&gt; about the game, the successful RSL system of play and look ahead to their midweek US Open Cup final against DC United.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning our attention back to the Caps, is there still some hope left? A little and we look at the scenarios that need to play out to see Vancouver make it to the postseason, as unlikely as that may seem just now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to end the show on a happier note with a look at the Whitecaps Residency’s start to the season and the recent Whitecaps media match that saw your two co-hosts square off in the Championship game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve tried not to depress you too much, but it was hard after such a performance by the Caps and our closing song probably won’t help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recorded in two parts, this the second part, the first of which was published as &lt;a href="http://www.canadiansoccernews.com/content.php?4965-The-AFTN-Podcast-Episode-19"&gt;Episode 19&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usual co-host Steve and myself are joined by &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenhamer&lt;/b&gt; from Curva Collective, long time fan &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; and AFTN writer &lt;b&gt;Jay Duke&lt;/b&gt; to a lot of Caps and MLS talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at the state of the Whitecaps nation last episode, our five man team try and look at where things have gone wrong this season. We turn our attentions to Martin Rennie, what he brings to the Caps and the future of the gaffer and the Whitecaps, this season and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is he responsible for the Whitecaps’ poor recent form or do the players have to shoulder a lot of the responsibility? If Rennie is to be replaced [...]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is he responsible for the Whitecaps’ poor recent form or do the players have to shoulder a lot of the responsibility? If Rennie is to be replaced, who are the main candidates out there to take over and will any changes go further up the managerial chain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to chat about transparency in MLS, or lack of.
&lt;br /&gt;
So many questions! There’s some answers but there’s also a lot more debated in amongst it all too, including Bobby Lenarduzzi being compared to your local corner store, David Ferreira to sticking a straw into a cow’s neck and what magical shoe purchases can be made with allocation money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recorded in two parts, the second of which will be up next week, this episode takes a look at the current state of the Vancouver Whitecaps nation. And what a state it seems to be in. More Michigan than California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usual co-host Steve and myself are joined by &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenhamer&lt;/b&gt; from Curva Collective, long time fan &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; and AFTN writer &lt;b&gt;Jay Duke&lt;/b&gt; to discuss the Caps talking points of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to look back at the loss in Dallas unfortunately. Was it as bad as it first appeared? It seems worse from Martin Rennie’s viewpoint, who has totally changed his thoughts about the performance. What was with the team selection and substitutions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on to San Jose, is there still hope that something can be salvaged from this season and what scenarios need to play out for Rennie to still be coach for next season? Who should play, who should be dropped and who wins the Ousted v Knighton v Cannon battle for starting goalkeeper? Will there maybe even be some trades before Friday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do our panel see the Caps finishing their season? What points total do they need, will they get it and who will fill the top five positions in the West?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many questions! There’s some answers but there’s also a lot more debated in amongst it all too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time for the guests to debate three key questions as they hope to win a mars bar in our &lt;i&gt;“30 Seconds To Mars”&lt;/i&gt; gameshow.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 18 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast comes just in time for Vancouver Whitecaps to head out on the road again on a three game away trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at what the Caps’ might need to get from these three crucial games and hear the thoughts of &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;, who are very honest about what they feel the Caps need to go out there and achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also look back at the draw with Chivas at the weekend. What can the Caps learn from that draw and how worried should we be about some of the deficiencies with the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent addition of Sam Adekugbe to the MLS squad, we discuss some of the current emerging talent and ask who will be next to make the step up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this and there’s still time to look at the murmurs surrounding MLS reducing the regular season to 28 games to cater for international dates.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 17 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast, is a San Jose post game pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the MLS Western Conference so tight right now, every game has a cup final feel about it and the Caps pulled out a vital 2-0 victory over San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the main talking points from the match and hear some post game audio from &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Nigel Reo-Coker&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Camilo&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;David Ousted&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also still time to look ahead to the Colorado game, Kenny Miller turning out for Scotland against the Auld Enemy and to pick over some individual player performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was recorded at BC Place right after the San Jose game, so enjoy all the background noises and horrible acoustics! We like to think of them as ambience.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode 16 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast, is a Philadelphia post game pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten man Vancouver Whitecaps lost their unbeaten home record to Philadelphia Union. We pick over the bones of the defeat, ask Martin Rennie why he went with an unchanged line up after the loss in LA, and search for the positives to take from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also look at some of the recent talking points from Whitecapsland. Will the team be strengthened before the transfer window shuts? Is the Kenny Miller extension good for both parties? Is Nigel Reo-Coker doing enough? Why all the hype about Gershon Koffie? And a lot more besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was recorded at BC Place right after the Philly game, so enjoy all the background noise from the air conditioning and the horrible acoustics from the room we were in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps remained unbeaten at home with a 3-1 win over Chicago Fire. We chat about the game and the impact of &lt;b&gt;Kekuta Manneh&lt;/b&gt;, along with audio from the Gambian and &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also chat about Camilo and discuss those murmurs about him playing for the Canadian national team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And talking of the national team, we have look back at the Gold Cup. Was it worth bringing such a young squad and what did they learn? We also hear from interim head coach &lt;b&gt;Colin Miller&lt;/b&gt;, who spoke to us after the Mexico defeat about the leap from the levels these guys have been playing to the international stage and what he thinks of some of the Canadian media criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One young guy who hopes to feature in the Canadian set up down the line is Whitecaps’ Residency prospect &lt;b&gt;Sam Adekugbe&lt;/b&gt;. Sam has been turning a lot of heads this past year and the general feeling is that he will be on the Caps’ MLS squad sooner rather than later. We caught up with Sam before he headed down to Houston for the U18s Finals week and spoke with him about his development, his hopes for the future, the USSDA Finals and his Canadian passport situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this and there’s still time to also chat with Vancouver Whitecaps Residency head coach Gordon Forrest about the tough test that the U18s will face this week at the Academy Finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was recorded at BC Place right after the Chicago game, so enjoy all the background noise from the air conditioning and slamming doors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lucky 13 for Vancouver Whitecaps as they finally got a monkey off their back and won their first Cascadia Cup game in the MLS era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve and myself look over the match and we hear post game from both managers, &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sigi Schmid&lt;/b&gt;, along with some chat from &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Brad Knighton&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Darren Mattocks&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look ahead at what’s coming up for the Caps and at what areas they should be looking to strengthen in the upcoming transfer window.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Episode 13 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlucky for some but not for you dear listener as we bring you a special podcast to tie in with &lt;a href="http://www.canadiansoccernews.com/tags.php?tag=residency+week"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Residency Week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here on AFTN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an interview with two Vancouver Whitecaps Residency players before they headed off to Dallas for the USSDA playoffs, goalscoring sensation &lt;b&gt;Brody Huitema&lt;/b&gt; and the very in-form &lt;b&gt;Spencer DeBoice&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re joined in the car park of UBC’s Thunderbird Stadium (yup, we record anywhere!) by &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenheimer&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Steven Lamothe&lt;/b&gt; to look at how the season has gone for the Caps U16s and U18s and we take a look at some of the exciting players that are coming through the program and could take the pitch one day for the MLS Caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an in-depth chat about the prospects of Sam Adekugbe and Brody Huitema, amongst others, and debate if/when we’ll see more of the Residency products not just in the MLS squad but getting serious minutes in the first team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you not interested in the Residency you can fast forward to the end because there’s still time for us to look ahead to the Caps in MLS action in the upcoming road trip to DC United and Sporting Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that a lot of the content in this podcast won’t be for everyone but we think it’s one of our best ones so far, just for the enthusiasm of four grown men talking passionately about the future of Vancouver Whitecaps and Canadian soccer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by Vancouver Whitecaps’ excellent, if somewhat fortuitous, comeback win over the New England Revolution, Steve and myself look at the match, the game turning moment all of the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear post game from both managers, &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jay Heaps&lt;/b&gt;, along with some chat from &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt;. There’s a look at the impact the Scotsman is having on the Caps this season, what Johnny Leveron joining the Honduran camp may mean for the next match and we look ahead to that game against Chivas on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to hear from Whitecaps legend &lt;b&gt;Carl Valentine&lt;/b&gt; about joining the Twittersphere.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Episode 12 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast, and it’s another one of our post game pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by Vancouver Whitecaps’ excellent, if somewhat fortuitous, comeback win over the New England Revolution, Steve and myself look at the match, the game turning moment all of the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear post game from both managers, &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jay Heaps&lt;/b&gt;, along with some chat from &lt;b&gt;Kenny Miller&lt;/b&gt;. There’s a look at the impact the Scotsman is having on the Caps this season, what Johnny Leveron joining the Honduran camp may mean for the next match and we look ahead to that game against Chivas on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to hear from Whitecaps legend &lt;b&gt;Carl Valentine&lt;/b&gt; about joining the Twittersphere.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Episode eleven of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast. Our last podcast was just before the Voyageurs Cup final and there’s been a lot happening in Whitecapsland since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no cups running over in Vancouver, just a lot of heartache and a long season still ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded on location at UBC at the Caps’ U23 friendly with North Sound Sea Wolves, we briefly look back at the highs of the New York and the lows of Montreal, before moving on to look at the Alain Rochat trade, the heartbreaking loss in Seattle and the back to back home games coming up for the Whitecaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look at the hot news topic in Canadian soccer this week, the CSA taking action against the Quebec soccer federation for their banning of wearing turbans whilst playing. With co-host Steve being a Sikh himself, we get an interesting insight into the whole debacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the &lt;a href="http://www.vancouveralpenclub.ca/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vancouver Alpen Club&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’re joined once again by &lt;b&gt;Zachary Meisenheimer&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Massimo Cusano&lt;/b&gt;, of Whitecaps’ supporters’ group Curva Collective, and AFTN writer &lt;b&gt;Jay Duke&lt;/b&gt; to discuss the highs and lows of Caps season so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of chat around the V’s Cup final against Montreal, the importance of the Cup and how it’s perceived by the general footballing public, and Zach gives us the first hand insight into what it was like addressing the Whitecaps players in the dressing room before the first leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on from the final, especially for those listening to the podcast after the game, we take a look at what lies ahead for the Whitecaps this season depending on whether they win or lose to Montreal. Just how significant will the push for the playoffs become? Where should the squad be strengthened in the summer transfer window? And who needs to make way for any new additions coming in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to introduce our new segment &lt;b&gt;My Favourite Things&lt;/b&gt;. There’s no songs from the Sound of Music, but we kick the segment off with a look at our favourite footballing years. Let us know your own ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of chat around how good/bad the first third of the season has been, who should be in the starting eleven and who shouldn’t? Who have we missed the most, why can’t we buy a road win, is Daigo Kobayashi any good, when will Greg Klazura get his shot, and who should start up front? We look at Martin Rennie’s tactics and I’m still trying to trade away Darren Mattocks.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s episode seven of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN soccer podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Pandher and myself take a look back at the Real Salt Lake game and ask why the Whitecaps make it so difficult to win on the road and &lt;b&gt;Andy O’Brien&lt;/b&gt; shares his thoughts on the Caps away woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big talking points to come out of the game was the post game dressing down from the manager and Nigel Reo-Coker. With the dust settled, we hear from &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Joe Cannon&lt;/b&gt;  about how good or bad that was for the team to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time to look ahead to the LA game at the weekend and the Whitecaps PDL season which gets underway on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also hear our brand new theme tune, specially written for us by local Vancouver band &lt;a href="http://www.theohwells.com"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Oh Wells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Check them out and support local music as well as local soccer.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:subtitle>Vancouver based soccer podcast covering Vancouver Whitecaps, MLS and the game in North America and beyond.</itunes:subtitle>
                    <itunes:summary>Episode six of "There's Still Time", the AFTN podcast and it's our first post game special.

Recorded at BC Place after the Dallas game, Steve and myself are joined by Andrew Bates to chat about the comeback, the terrible defending, the diving, the missed opportunities and what the Whitecaps need to do to try and get a MLS win again.

We have post game audio from Caps coach Martin Rennie about Darren Mattocks and Steve takes part in an interesting threesome with Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman and the Province's Marc Weber.

Our main guest this episode is Vancouver Whitecaps' defender Greg Klazura, who made his season debut against FC Edmonton in the Voyageurs Cup on Wednesday. We talk to Greg about the game, how he's settling in to life in Vancouver, the frustrations of waiting for his MLS debut and of course his famous headband and faces. And just why was he wearing gloves in nine degrees weather?!

And there's still time to look ahead to Wednesday and what may lie in store in the second leg against the Eddies and who we'd like to see the Caps face in the final.

Going forward, we're planning to do several of these post game pods this season, with different guests and co-hosts, and a lot more audio from the locker rooms.

Have a listen!</itunes:summary>

Hello, good evening and welcome to Episode Five of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt;, the AFTN podcast.
&lt;p&gt;Our guest this week is Canadian U17 captain and Vancouver Whitecaps’ Residency keeper &lt;b&gt;Marco Carducci&lt;/b&gt;. We talk to Marco about the recent World Cup qualifiers in Panama, look ahead to the finals in the UAE and chat about the Residency, his hopes for the future and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Pandher and myself take a look back at Vancouver’s double headers with Dallas and Edmonton and look ahead to the next two games coming up against them. Can the Caps play much worse and what is the road forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time this week for a new ‘Bucket List’. What football experiences would you like to have in person before you kick the bucket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So enough waffle, there’s enough of that in the podcast. Have a listen, let us know what you think and what improvements we can make or new segments we can include.&lt;/p&gt;

Playing Episode 4 of &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; can be your foreplay to this weekend’s Whitecaps action.
&lt;p&gt;We look back on the draw against Real Salt Lake and ahead to the upcoming double header against current Western Conference leaders, Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, there’s some in the Dallas camp that go down at the slightest breeze. How hard is it for the Whitecaps to play against a team like that and can they do anything to prevent losing out to a conned ref? We ask &lt;b&gt;Nigel Reo-Coker&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/b&gt; for their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time this week for Steve Pandher and myself to take a look back at the “Hot Topics” of this week’s MLS action, such as should men wearing hairbands be casting aspersions about people’s sexuality? Also we let you know what Provincial Cup games you should be getting yourselves out to this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue with our ‘Bucket List’ topic, around which football stadiums we want to visit before we leave this mortal coil, with the thoughts of &lt;a href="http://groundhoppingca.wordpress.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Groundhopping Canada’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;Devon Rowcliffe&lt;/b&gt; on some local and international stadiums that he’s visited and he highly recommends should be on your list. Don’t worry, we’ll have a new ‘bucket list’ topic next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s still time this week for Steve Pandher and myself to take a look back at Vancouver’s incident packed draw with San Jose and look ahead to the Real Salt Lake game at the weekend as the Whitecaps finally return to Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, &lt;i&gt;“There’s Still Time”&lt;/i&gt; will adopt a number of different formats for forthcoming episodes. Some will be just pure chat, there will be some interviews, some episodes will be a roundtable down the pub style and we’re also planning on bringing you some post home game specials. We may even throw in the odd “after dark” episode for those not easily offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So enough waffle, there’s enough of that in the podcast. Have a listen, let us know what you think and what improvements we can make or new segments we can include.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;And they said it wouldn’t last. We’re back with Episode Two of “There’s Still Time”, the new AFTN podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so many Scottish accents on this week’s show that you’ll feel you’re watching Braveheart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re joined by Whitecaps Residency Head Coach Gordon Forrest, for a chat about the program and how he’s found the Whitecaps since joining the club late last year. We look at some of the U18s top talent and try not to count our chickens too much by looking ahead to the USSDA playoffs in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving a little bit east, we speak with ex Whitecap and current FC Edmonton boss Colin Miller about Edmonton’s NASL season that gets underway on Saturday. How will the Eddies wealth of Canadian talent fare this year? Can Miller transform them from worst to first? And what kind of impact will the strange mid season break have on the League? We chat about all that and more.

We chat about all that and more.
We continue last week’s ‘Bucket List’ topic, around which football stadiums we want to visit before we leave this mortal coil, with the thoughts of Groundhopping Canada’s Devon Rowcliffe. There’s old grounds, stadiums beside castles, some soon to be no more grounds and more.
And there’s still time this week for Steve Pandher and myself to take a look back at Vancouver’s defeat to Chivas and look ahead to the San Jose game at the weekend. Will the Whitecaps away woes continue? Should there be some squad rotation? Or will the Caps’ speed have San Jose quaking in their boots? And just what do we make of Vancouver’s month of March?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, “There’s Still Time” will adopt a number of different formats for forthcoming episodes. Some will be just pure chat, there will be some interviews, some episodes will be a roundtable down the pub style and we’re also planning on bringing you some post home game specials. We may even throw in the odd “after dark” episode for those not easily offended. So enough waffle, there’s enough of that in the podcast. Have a listen, let us know what you think and what improvements we can make or new segments we can include. And don’t forget to tell us your ‘bucket list’ suggestions below.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been planning on doing this for a while now, but have finally got off our asses and recorded one. So welcome to Episode One of “There’s Still Time”, the new AFTN podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our inaugural episode, your hosts, Steve Pandher and myself, take a brief look back at the Houston defeat and look ahead to the Chivas game at the weekend. How dirty will the Goats be and should the Caps be worried? We get the thoughts of Martin Rennie, Joe Cannon and Erik Hurtado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the Whitecaps scrimmage against Edmonton this week and catch up with former fan favourite Wes Knight to see how he’s settling in with the Eddies and his Vancouver memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And although the Caps are away on MLS duty this weekend, there is still a veritable feast of football for you to get out and watch. We preview the Residency’s two big Cascadia derby games on Saturday against Seattle and have look at their season and standouts so far.&lt;/p&gt;
