This is our first in a three-part series on dogs in antiquity. This episodes serves up one of the most popular examples of canines in art, the Colima dog of ancient West Mexico, captured in an exemplary ceramic specimen in Art Institute of Chicago. Our lingua culinaria isn’t too off base, as the hairless hounds and pudgy puppies of ancient Mesoamerica were in fact a common food source. And with their rising popularity on the modern scene, the hairless xoloitzcuintli and Peruvian dog breeds might just be the new black! Music: &lt;i&gt;Nunca Fui a Granada&lt;/i&gt; by GranadaDoaba.

The prophesied comet of the century, Comet ISON, may have bit the dust, but that's no reason to pile dirt on our exploration of comets of past and present in the world of art. In two rare examples of auspicious comets in antiquity, Augustus Caesar and Mithridates VI of Pontus exploit coinage as vehicle for propaganda. We discuss the cameo of Halley's Comet on the Bayeux Tapestry capturing the Battle of Hastings in AD 1066, then trace Halley's Comet's apparitions back to 87 BC, 164 BC, ... no wait, 240 BC. Holy smokes ... 466 BC!? Chinese observers take the cake with the Comet Atlas of Mawangdui. And does the ancient, sacred, and much-maligned symbol of the swastika owe its origin to ancient comets? Lastly, has the ancient Egyptian demon serpent of chaos, Apophis, set his sights on Earth with a firestorm from above in 2036?

Enjoy this spooktacular free Halloween segment of the Ancient Art Podcast episode 59, "A Witches' Sabbath!" Meet the wicked witches, devilish denizens, and things that go bump in the night in the Art Institute of Chicago's painting "A Witches' Sabbath" by Dutch artist Cornelis Saftleven. &lt;strong&gt;Grab the complete episode at &lt;a href="http://ancientartpodcast.org/curious"&gt;http://ancientartpodcast.org/curious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The complete episode explores the peculiar fascination Dutch and Flemish artists had with the proverbial "fire and brimstone," including the famous pioneer of the genre Hieronymus Bosch. A detailed examination of "A Witches' Sabbath" reveals various influences and motivations. We discuss the cultural context of Christian puritanism, the twisted history and legacy of the Witches' Sabbath a.k.a. Walpurgisnacht, and its relationship with legend of Faust.

                    <itunes:summary>Greetings gashlycrumbs! Enjoy this spooktacular free Halloween segment of the Ancient Art Podcast episode 59, "A Witches' Sabbath!" Meet the wicked witches, devilish denizens, and things that go bump in the night in the Art Institute of Chicago's painting "A Witches' Sabbath" by Dutch artist Cornelis Saftleven. Grab the complete episode at http://ancientartpodcast.org/curious. The complete episode explores the peculiar fascination Dutch and Flemish artists had with the proverbial "fire and brimstone," including the famous pioneer of the genre Hieronymus Bosch. A detailed examination of "A Witches' Sabbath" reveals various influences and motivations. We discuss the cultural context of Christian puritanism, the twisted history and legacy of the Witches' Sabbath a.k.a. Walpurgisnacht, and its relationship with legend of Faust.

This episode delves deeper into her primal lair. We confront her petrifying gaze while closely examining a few famous works of ancient art exploring Medusa’s roots, influences, and evolutions. Included are the Bronze Age Minoan "Snake Goddesses," the Polyphemus Amphora, the Nessos Amphora, the Temple of Artemis at Corfu, kylix eye-cups, and the Egyptian god Bes.

From high in the snow-capped Alpine peaks comes a powerfully spiced beer brewed in the tradition of German &amp; Austrian Glühwein. Watch the beer take shape before your very eyes as the curtain is pulled on the home brewing process. Krampuslauf rewards good little boys and girls with treats of citrus, anise, cinnamon, and clove, while naughty children get flogged with a switch of birch and stuffed into Krampus's scratchy sack. The rich crimson hue and herby, earthy notes will surely bring you back for another toast to Krampus the Christmas Devil! &lt;a href="http://ancientartpodcast.org/56"&gt;http://ancientartpodcast.org/56&lt;/a&gt;.

Krampuslauf rewards good little boys and girls with treats of citrus, anise, cinnamon, and clove, while naughty children get flogged with a switch of birch and stuffed into Krampus's scratchy sack. The rich crimson hue and herby, earthy notes will surely bring you back for another toast to Krampus the Christmas Devil! http://ancientartpodcast.org/56.

&lt;p&gt;Who's that hiding behind Santa's jolly mask? Episode 54 of the Ancient Art Podcast takes a holiday to the Austrian Alps to discover the true meaning of Christmas and meet Santa's various spooky, sooty sidekicks! We lift the lid on the mysterious, fur-clad, horned, Yuletide devil, Krampus, exploring his origin in pagan myths, history throughout the ages, and modern permutations. We'll cross the globe to root out the tongue-lashing demon, and risk his whip's wrath in the Krampuslauf. Also meet jolly ole Saint Nick's other companions, including the Nordic Yule Goat, Belgium and the Netherlands' Black Peter (Zwarte Piet), the German Knecht Ruprecht, and Belsnickel/Pelznikel. And we thought keeping Santa's reindeer straight was hard enough! So, dive in and enjoy this spectacular nightmare before Christmas!

Episode 52 of the Ancient Art Podcast is all about Wine in Ancient Egypt. There really was a King Scorpion and what did he drink? Ancient Egyptian Spring Break drunken orgies. Embarrassing yourself for all eternity well before the Facebook generation. What's it really mean when your god gets drunk? King Tut's "wishing cup," Nebamun's hoity-toity parties, Herodotus goes to Bubastis, Hatshepsut's porch of drunkenness, and Sekhmet gets drunk again. All that and more!

We'll look at the archaeological record to sort fact from fiction on the brewing process and dig up some modern attempts at recreating the ancient recipes for Egyptian beer. Chemical analysis of ancient beer residue paints a telling picture as funerary art and literary sources flesh out culture of some of the world's earliest brewers. Included in episode 51 are discussions of modern versus ancient brewing ingredients and techniques, Patrick McGovern's "Uncorking the Past," Dogfish Head's Ta Henket beer, the research of Delwen Samuel, the ancient "zeer pot" refrigerator (or nested pot-in-pot fridge), and the myth of the lioness goddess Sekhmet.

Dragons permeate our cultural heritage in many forms and fashions: as ferocious fire-breathing, flesh-eating monsters, noble emblems of honor, and peace-loving creatures of earth, air, and water. From the salty depths of the Mediterranean, across the sun-scorched deserts of Central Asia, to the misty mountains of China and Japan, where do dragons first take root? What are the ancient sources for our modern legends? Pack your bags, buy your spell components, and polish your long sword, because we're going dragon hunting!

Dragons permeate our cultural heritage in many forms and fashions: as ferocious fire-breathing, flesh-eating monsters, noble emblems of honor, and peace-loving creatures of earth, air, and water. From the salty depths of the Mediterranean, across the sun-scorched deserts of Central Asia, to the misty mountains of China and Japan, where do dragons first take root? What are the ancient sources for our modern legends? Pack your bags, buy your spell components, and polish your long sword, because we're going dragon hunting!

We look at a few later marble and bronze copies of this acclaimed work housed in the Vatican, Louvre, and elsewhere. We also explore the possibility that the original bronze Apollo Sauroktonos may not be lost to history. The hidden meaning behind the Lizard Slayer comes to light as a metaphor for the titanic struggle between the divine Apollo and the gargantuan serpentine dragon Python, between the gods of Mount Olympus and the primordial race of titans.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;A short audio  announcement. We recently had to move the podcast over to a new web host. Trying to make the transition as smooth as possible, in short, if you've received this, then you're in the right place and your podcast client is connected to the correct feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any old bookmarks for the podcast, especially ones with the words "me.com" or "mac.com" in the links, then those will probably stop working come this summer. My advice would be to bookmark the homepage itself, &lt;a href="http://ancientartpodcast.org/"&gt;ancientartpodcast.org&lt;/a&gt;, instead of a sub-page, because every episode is always just a click away from the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what's all this mean for you? Well, not much, except you can sleep easy knowing that the Ancient Art Podcast now has unlimited storage and bandwidth, and you don't need the "www" any more! Now that's just space age!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all y'all who've been tuning in to the Ancient Art Podcast over the years. It's always great hearing from you. You can get in touch with me at info@ancientartpodcast.org or use the feedback form on the website at &lt;a href="http://ancientartpodcast.org/feedback/"&gt;ancientartpodcast.org/feedback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, episode 47 of the Ancient Art Podcast about the "Roman Fasces" dares to find out! Composed of a bundle of rods with an axe blade sticking out, this ancient symbol of solidarity and judicial authority was a very recognizable sight in Ancient Rome. We explore the symbolism of the fasces, its different makes and models, where it came from and where it went. The fasces remains highly popular today on military and political crests, emblems, and shields across the world. We'll also be introduced to some good Roman citizens, whose careers crossed paths with the fasces, including lictor bodyguards, flamen priests, and magistrates.

Slurp up a puddle of fermented fish guts with the Ancient Art Podcast! Episode 45 explores the decorative delights, culinary curiosities, and amorous affections of the ancient Greek world. While it packs a punch as an interesting cultural anomaly, the fish plate is an often-overlooked curiosity in the lineup of ancient Greece ceramics. In the 4th century BC, the ancient Greek appetite for fish blossomed as a culture phenomenon, an art form, and a borderline-clinical obsession, rich with sexual innuendos, double-meanings, and salacious undertones. While the fish plate remains somewhat subdued in the otherwise bawdy company at this episode's dinner table, it's always the quiet ones, who hide the secrets. What was the fish plate all about, after all?

Celebrating the our 42nd episode with a brief nod to the &lt;i&gt;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/i&gt; by the uncanny Douglas Adams, the Ancient Art Podcast continues to explore the &lt;i&gt;Top 10 Ancient Egyptian Myths &amp; Misconceptions&lt;/i&gt; with "The 'Boy King' Tutankhamun." Arguably the most famous and studied figure from Ancient Egypt, Tutankhamun is shrouded in mystery. Who was this enigmatic ruler behind all the myth and mysteries? Who were his parents? What does his reign tell us about the cultural, religious, and political climate of Ancient Egypt during the dusk of the Amarna Period? What's the real truth behind the "Mummy's Curse?" Can we learn any secrets from his short life and the truth behind his untimely death? Can this episode finally put the nail in Tut's coffin? So long, Tut, and thanks for all the fish.

Were the Egyptians just stuck in the mud or what? No and no! The Top 10 Ancient Egyptian Myths and Misconceptions continues with an examination of broad changes to Egyptian art across the history of their civilization. We go from the Early Dynastic Period through the Old and Middle Kingdoms up to the New Kingdom and beyond exploring stylistic and thematic variation that's deeply entrenched in Ancient Egypt's cultural evolution. In this episode, we look closely at the Narmer Palette, relief decoration at Karnak Temple, and a plethora of works from the Art Institute of Chicago. Explore more at http://ancientartpodcast.org.

Are these truly scenes from daily life or is there more to it than that? Episode 39 delves deeper into the meaning and symbolism behind tomb decoration. We compare private and royal tombs, examining the evidence of what is and isn't represented. Included in this episode are Theban Tomb 36 (TT36), the 12th Dynasty tomb of Djehutihotep, a nod to the "hotep-di-nisw" and Book of the Dead, and we'll revisit our old friend Nebamun.

                    <itunes:summary>We learn that the Ancient Egyptians surrounded themselves in death with idyllic scenes from everyday life. Are these truly scenes from daily life or is there more to it than that? Episode 39 delves deeper into the meaning and symbolism behind tomb decoration. We compare private and royal tombs, examining the evidence of what is and isn't represented. Included in this episode are Theban Tomb 36 (TT36), the 12th Dynasty tomb of Djehutihotep, a nod to the "hotep-di-nisw" and Book of the Dead, and we'll revisit our old friend Nebamun.

We delve into the Ancient Egyptian concept of Heaven, unearth some ancient grave goods, and take a close hard look at the themes and subjects decorating the walls of Ancient Egyptian tombs. The evidence reveals a culture obsessed not with death, but with life! Included in this episode are the famous wall paintings from the New Kingdom tomb of Nebamun, now in the British Museum, the solar boat of King Khufu at Giza, and a roundup of &lt;em&gt;shabti&lt;/em&gt; figurines from the Art Institute of Chicago.

The Art Institute of Chicago's new Weston Wing of Japanese Art showcases wonderful works from Japanese prehistory through present day. We wrap our head around the 5th and 6th century earthenware haniwa tomb figures of Japan's Kofun era, including a particularly magnificent clay horse. An interesting passage from an ancient text reveals there's more than meets the eye to these figurines. We see what's at stake in some ghoulish Japanese ghost stories. And the haunting Edo period woodblock prints of the series &amp;quot;One Hundred Ghost Stories&amp;quot; (Hyaku Monogatari) by the master printmaker Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) contributes to the creepiness. Lastly, we put the nail in the coffin with a nod to modern horror cinema. Light some candles and snuggle up for our most horrific episode yet!

We look closely at a few magnificent sculptures of Ganesha at the Art Institute of Chicago and conclude with an exploration of the contemporary art installation Public Notice 3 by Jitish Kallat on view through January 2, 2011, which juxtaposes Swami Vivekananda’s September 11, 1893 speech in Chicago on religious tolerance with the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.

From the 2nd century CE, the larger-than-life marble heads of Hadrian and Antinous exemplify the Hellenistic aesthetics and innovation of the Hadrianic era. We discuss the life and times of this dynamic duo, explore the tragic fate of Antinous with his true-to-life unsolved mystery along the Nile, and discover just how far even a, by all accounts, level-headed grieving emperor is willing to go. To round things out, we'll have a brief glimpse of the history of beards in the Roman world and explore how modern connoisseurship, scholarship, and prejudice will mold and influence our understanding of the ancient world.

Examining two images of the dancing Shiva&#160;at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame, we explore the timeless concept of the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction. We see a philosophy of balance and harmony expressed through the union of diverging opposites, like creation and destruction, male and female, life and death -- and we learn how the imagery, symbolism, and iconography of the popular Nataraja figure embody this philosophy and spiritual belief. Plus we discover Shiva's function as the destroyer of the cosmos, the supreme yogi and cosmic dancer, and father of the beloved elephant-headed deity Ganesha, the Remover of Obstacles.

For HD video visit ancientartpodcast.org. Keeping our promise from last episode, episode 26 explores the history, artistry, and mythology of the famous Hellenistic sculpture, the Aphrodite of Knidos by Praxiteles. Using the words of ancient authors like Hesiod, Pliny the Elder, and others, we examine multiple copies of the sculpture, including the Vatican’s Colonna Venus, the Uffizi’s Venus de' Medici, the Aphrodite Braschi of the Munich Glyptothek, and an example from the Art Institute of Chicago. We also expose the misnomer of the Roman “copy” of an original Greek sculpture. And we’ll round things out with some modern revisionist theories on the sexuality of Aphrodite.</description>

For HD video visit ancientartpodcast.org. With a nod to the Art Institute of Chicago’s October self-guide and celebrating the Halloween season, episode 25 explores a few headless and disembodied works of art, including the humorous, the grotesque, and the just plain practical. We compare a Roman statue of a seated woman to its Classical Greek antecedents and explore one very logical explanation for why so many Roman statues are missing their heads and arms.</description>

For HD video visit ancientartpodcast.org. Episode 24 brings us the art of the Japanese folding screen from the exhibition Beyond Golden Clouds: Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum. We’ll explore traditional styles, motifs, subjects, and forms, and also discover contemporary examples of the Japanese screen breaking boundaries and redefining the art form. Two works are examined in close detail, Flowering Cherry and Autumn Maples with Poem Slips by Tosa Mitsuoki and Mountain Lake Screen Tachi by Okura Jiro, in a discussion weaving together tradition and innovation, antiquity and contemporary, banal and spiritual.</description>

For HD video visit ancientartpodcast.org. Putting the cap on the jar of Akhenaten, episode 23 explores works from the reign of the boy king Tutankhamun and his successors. Do the efforts of the 18th dynasty heretic king Akhenaten die hard or do his radical transformations live on? Dive in to discover the artistic legacy of the Amarna period on the throne of King Tut and a fragment from the private tomb of Iniuia and Yui. In this episode, we also closely examine a fragmentary statue bust of a woman from the New Kingdom at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, which you may have recently witnessed for its uncanny resemblance to the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.</description>

We look closely at one exemplary piece, a marble statue of a youth from ancient Athens, the so-called “Metropolitan Kouros” of ca. 590–580 B.C. We’ll see how the early Greek kouros type is borrowed directly from Egyptian statuary. We also explore sculpture’s original function and message in Ancient Greece plus the social context in which sculpture develops.</itunes:summary>

We’ll look closely at an important transitional piece, the so-called Harpy Tomb at Xanthos in Lycia, as well as a couple Persian imperial sites, Susa and Persepolis, before turning westward to Athens. We’ll also examine the role of Persian monumental art and architecture and reveal the Greek stylistic influence passed on to Persia by the Ionian artists.

We explore the Ancient Near Eastern influence on developing Greek civilization along with Greece's own interest in their own mythic, heroic past. We also discuss the strategic importance of Corinth in the cultural and commercial climate of the Orientalizing Period, while comparing the newly emerging, but short-lived Corinthian ware of this day and age to the traditional Geometric Period ware of earlier centuries and contemporary neighbors. We check out the emergence of Classical Doric Greek temple architecture in the Temple of Artemis at Corfu and see how its sculptural decor relates to the cultural milieu of Archaic Greece and the arts of the Orientalizing Period. The Art Institute Orientalizing Period pyxis further demonstrates a quintessential synthesis of imported Near Eastern mythology, symbolism, and iconography with the Greece's newfound passion for the iconography and symbolism of their own native, ancient, Bronze Age Mycenaean heroic and mythic ancestry. And on top of all of that, we even manage to tie in the famed Lion's Gate of Ancient Mycenae.
