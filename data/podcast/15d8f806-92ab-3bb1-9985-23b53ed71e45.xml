                    <description>Greeting ATA Listeners! Have you ever had the feeling that the mountain of news to come out of Comic Con is so high, it puts you in a valley so low where&amp;nbsp;you're confused on which way to go? Well, ATA is here to give you a hand and lead you through Comic Con Land With our annual Across The Airwaves Comic Con Special. So join Nico as he takes us on a free ride through his actual trip to Comic Con 2014 with his live on the floor reactions to The Flash and Constantine Pilots along with the panels for TNT's Legends, The Last Ship, Falling Skies,&amp;nbsp;Sharknado 2, Helix, Defiance and NASA's Next Giant Leap.
However, that's not all this episode has in store for you Listeners as I join Nico in discussing news reported from The Con about The DC Comics Live-Action TV Shows (Gotham, The Flash, Arrow and Constantine), Star Wars Rebels, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice (in addition to the Wonder Woman Costume) and the return of our Television Favorites including Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, Sleepy Hollow, Supernatural and Person of Interest.
Also just because I didn't mention Castle or Doctor&amp;nbsp;Who doesn't mean we are going to stop covering these shows when returning from hiatus, they just did not attend Comic Con this year and for ATA's coverage on Marvel content to come out of Comic Con you can check out The Helicarrier Podcast's Comic Con Themed Episode.</description>

On this installment, Andy, Nicki and Dan get together after a long break to review the two big Marvel movies, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past and be aware of major spoilers!
They also discuss several news items for Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil, (this episode was recorded before the two latest casting news came out so that's why they aren't mentioned), Ant-Man and Doctor Strange.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's podcast, we are playing a Game of Star Wars as we review the Season Finale of HBO's Blockbuster Series Game of Thrones and discuss Star Wars: The Clone Wars as a entire series in response to the final season being released on Netflix. There's also more Star Wars than just that as News with Nico provides an update on Harrison Ford's on set injury and sets up a discussion on the list of brilliant directors Disney has tapped to work on Episodes VIII, IX and potential Star Wars spinoff films. In addition, with the exciting news Legend of Korra: Book 3 is starting early, we discuss our future plans for reviewing the show while Nico brings this episode home with the Airwaves Rundown section reviewing the Season Finales for Orphan Black and FX's Fargo. Oh and last but not least Nico and I are going to take a brief hiatus from doing ATA but will be back in late July/early August for a Comic Con 2014 Review Episode.</description>

Yes, it was that good and Nico will tell you why as I share my predictions regarding the battle not being over yet with thoughts of Game of Thrones topping it in the future. Also in our News with Nico Section we discuss the trailer for Legend of Korra: Book 3, revival of The Magic School Bus, the casting of Kingpin for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a Magic: The Gathering Movie and a new, exciting role for fan favorite Tom Hiddleston that's guaranteed to show off all of his talents. Then we bring this episode home with our Airwaves Rundown reviewing the penultimate episodes for Orphan Black and Fargo.</description>

                    <description>Hi ATA Listeners, it's Dan here. As you've probably noticed we've been making a lot of big changes with our website to make listening to Across the Airwaves and its related podcasts better for you. On that note, through our process of spring cleaning we noticed that what needed the most work was our About ATA Page as it contained way too much text for you to read explaining what our podcast is all about. So to make this process more entertaining my good friend Doug Roewer and his company Ambient Productions decided to help us out by making a documentary telling the origin story of Across the Airwaves. And with that all I can say is sit back, relax and enjoy the show&amp;hellip;</description>

                    <description>Hey, hey, hey, ATA Listeners! This week's podcast is dedicated to the endless wonder of a TV Series known as Warehouse 13 for "realzies" as we review the&amp;nbsp; show's Series Finale along with the Season Finales for Supernatural, Revolution, Modern Family and an all new episode of Game of Thrones. In addition, we discuss some big news surrounding the premiere date of Doctor Who Series 8, the unveiling of a Batman themed hotel room&amp;nbsp; and Marvel's Netflix TV Series. Followed by Nico bagging and tagging this artifact with the Airwaves Rundown Section reviewing the Season Finale of The Americans, Orphan Black and Fargo.
By the way as one last announcement, there will not be an ATA Episode released next week due to Game of Thrones taking a one week hiatus in honor of Memorial Day and most of the other shows we cover being off for the Summer.</description>

                    <description>Hello fellow Arrowheads! Welcome to the FINAL episode of Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast, the podcast dedicated to covering the CW's hit superhero television series: Arrow. For over five years, Woo S! Kim and I have not been trapped on a hellish Island known as Lian Yu, but we have been friends, back then we were joined through Smallville, since then it has expanded further than either of us thought it would and has brought us to Arrow. We started Longbow Hunters back in the summer of 2012, not knowing if Arrow would be a hit or a miss but we decided to take the chance. Since then, we have had the absolute pleasure to talk about Arrow, Green Arrow, DC Comics, and more on air with this show for the past two years with all of you guys who we hold very near and dear to our hearts. We've been able to talk with Marc Guggenheim, Blake Neely, Jeff Lemire (behind the scenes anyways), and all of you about Arrow, the character of Green Arrow, and about our show and we've had a blast doing it.
Unfortunately, it is time to "bid adieu" as I am moving on to the next stage of my life and as Woo and I's lives both become much more busy, certainly busier than they were two years ago. Although we gave some of you guys shout outs in our finale episode, which you can find the links to below of download via the Across the Airwaves iTunes/Stitcher pages, I would like to again thank Dan &amp;amp; Nico, Andy, Christopher Wietrick, Alisa Lea, Jay, Lauren, VerdantArrow, Steve &amp;amp; Derek - our inspiration, and a host of others for your love, support, and dedication to Longbow Hunters as we took this two year journey through the DC Universe. It's almost fitting that we're leaving just as some of our favorite characters are given their sends offs on Arrow, like Slade Wilson &amp;amp; Sara Lance (who quite frankly, we don't ever have to see again), and we see that Oliver has finally taken his first steps off of Lian Yu in the flashbacks, just as we saw him do in the "Pilot" almost two years ago.
Anyway, thank you all for listening and enjoy our finale episode of The Longbow Hunters&amp;nbsp;where we cover the Arrow - Season 2 episode "Unthinkable", The Flash - Extended Trailer, our favorite memories during LBH, and what we plan on doing next! Plus, a special guest appearance by Mr. Dan Schmidt himself! All this and more on the final episode of Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week we are freaking out over it being that time of the year again for Season Finales as we had to watch our favorite TV Characters contend with wedding madness, a death faking experience, going off the deep end, godlike computer systems going haywire and the old classic trial by&amp;nbsp; combat. However, just because we are freaking out doesn't mean we can't calm you down as we review new episodes of Game of Thrones, Once upon a Time, Castle, Warehouse 13, Person of Interest, Supernatural, Revolution, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory speculating the future for these shows or predicting how they will end. Oh and there's more fun to be had from there as Nico provides another edition of his Airwaves Rundown Section reviewing Fargo, Orphan Black, Penny Dreadful, Grimm and maybe a few other things.</description>

That being said, on this week's episode of Longbow Hunters, we talk about the penultimate episode of Arrow - Season 2 entitled "Streets of Fire", and no, we didn't start it. We talk about Oliver, Slade, Laurel, Sara, Diggle, Felicity, Roy, Thea, Malcolm, and literally just about every character on the show as everyone has a role in this past week's episode. But after we're done talking with Twitter, do not turn off the podcast for not one but TWO reasons. The first reason is that Woo &amp;amp; I have an IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT for our listeners this week regarding our show and the other is so that you can hear our SPOILER section after listening to some Billy Joel. All this and more on this week's penultimate Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's about time Television's Big Bads know that the jig is up, the noose is out and we've finally found them with this week's reviews on Game of Thrones, Castle, Warehouse 13, Person of Interest, Supernatural and Revolution where the renegade villains featured on these shows were either&amp;nbsp; set up to be retrieved for a bounty or made to go nevermore astray thanks to Television's Heroes. The sitcoms we cover also went on a manhunt on their own searching for the renegade known as comedy with Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory using drama to boost ratings when laughs is what brings in their audience but thankfully New Girl came through in the clutch delivering the comedy we were looking for with its cruise ship centered season finale.
Although,&amp;nbsp; with the Airwaves Rundown Section it was back to hunting down villains with Nico's reviews on The Americans, Orphan Black, Fargo and Grimm. Oh and if you listen to the Enhanced Version of the podcast be sure to not skip past this week's News with Nico section as it's filled with a wealth of knowledge about what shows including some ATA favorites are going to be picked up or cancel by the big networks for the Fall.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's a nice day for a White Wedding, Game of Thrones style that is as we reviewed an episode of TV's hottest Medieval Fantasy/Drama that delivered yet another postnuptial shocker for a fan favorite character to follow up the mind blowing Red Wedding from last season. However, this wasn't the only episode we reviewed this week where the tables were turned on our Television favorites with Mike making a life changing decision on The Following, the final season premiere of Warehouse 13 showing us an evil alternate version of the Warehouse, the machine asking Finch to kill on this week's Person of Interest and Supernatural making it look like the Winchesters are the bad guys. There was also fun to be had with the sitcoms we cover as New Girl showed it hasn't missed a comedic beat despite two major characters breaking up &amp;nbsp;and Community delivered what may be their final episode in a way that dared NBC to cancel the show. Then after that we round things out with Nico's regular review on The Americans followed by his look at a few new things including BBC America's Orphan Black and Fargo, a new hit TV series based off of the Coen Brothers Film.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode is all about celebrating the beginning of our reviews on Game of Thrones Season 4 where Nico presented us with the huge omen change is coming for our favorite characters. However, don't think this prophecy effects just one show as the sitcoms also showed signs of change as Sheldon made a huge new lifestyle decision and Community featured Greendale becoming a University defined by the phrase five dollar foot long. In addition to that we've got Andy and I reviewing Once upon a Time, Nico and special guest Bill reviewing The Following, Woo and Andy reviewing Glee and Nico bringing it all home with the Airwaves Rundown Section reviewing the season finale for Justified, The Americans, the first season of Helix and Grimm. Plus, to top that off Nico throws in some Watch It or Nots for the new AMC historic series Turn and Mike Judge's new comedy series for HBO entitled Silicon Valley.</description>

On this episode, Andy and Dan reviews the 17th episode of&amp;nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., "Turn, Turn, Turn", that was a huge game changer for this TV show as the events of&amp;nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&amp;nbsp;plays a huge part in it.
Be aware that there will be major spoilers from the&amp;nbsp;Captain America&amp;nbsp;sequel in this review as several events from that movie plays into the TV show. The two nerdy hosts also speculate in depth what is going to happen to the show as a whole, with everything that happened in this episode.
Andy and Dan also talks about several exciting news items, from two big Marvel players coming back in&amp;nbsp;episode 20&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the season finale&amp;nbsp;respectively, as well as&amp;nbsp;2 hours of&amp;nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;on April 15!&amp;nbsp;Before they head into the spoiler section, they take time to read a couple of tweets and e-mails from the fans about the episode.

                    <description>Hey Kids, I want you to sit down and hear for over the next nine years the story of how I Met your mother. Actually, the story is more about how I met your G.I. Joe as this week of television featured the awkward pairing of our reviews on the controversial How I Met Your Mother Series Finale and the brilliant Community episode that inserted itself into the 80s Cartoon world of G.I. Joe. Beyond this, some normalcy was found in our reviews on Once upon a Time, The Following, Intelligence, Person of Interest, Glee, Revolution, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. However,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the theme of brutality seemed to be a common thread in the episodes of The Walking Dead, Justified, The Americans and Grimm Nico chose to review this week in our Airwaves Rundown Section.
By the way, I'd like to thank our ATA Corps Member Woo Kim for all of the How I Met Your Mother voicemails he has sent us over the past two seasons, your insight on the show is absolutely brilliant and we really appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to share your thoughts with our listeners on a weekly basis. Thanks again, Woo! Your How I Met Your Mother Sections will be missed!</description>

Although, just because we are giving away the ending to this podcast, doesn't mean it's not worth listening to the sections that come before hand. In fact, look at these sections not like the Star Wars Prequels but something more satisfying like The Hobbit Series as we deliver reviews on this week's episodes of Once upon a Time, The Following, Castle,&amp;nbsp; Intelligence, Supernatural, Person of Interest and Glee. And if we haven't confused you with this episode description more than Burton Guster is around women, then stick around after the Psych Finale Discussion for our sitcom reviews on How I Met Your Mother, New Girl and Modern Family along with the Airwaves Rundown Section where Nico reviews The Walking Dead, Justified and The Americans.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on today's podcast we ask the question why can't we be friends? That's because we reviewed a week of Television where our favorite characters had to put their trust in a person they weren't necessarily sure of as Once upon a Time had Emma on a witch hunt with The Evil Queen, a killer returns from the dead to be a possible ally on The Following, Castle teams up with a ninja, Intelligence had Gabriel befriend a teenage hacker down on his luck, Supernatural forced The Winchesters to play sponsor to a strung out on human blood Crowley, Finch was challenged to trust in the machine choosing Root as its conduit on Person of Interest, Psych had Gus put his trust in a dream therapist played by Bruce Campbell to fight the zombies out of his dreams and last but not least Revolution had Miles seek out allies to rise up against The Patriots only to have Monroe blow it all up in his face.
Also after another solid Glee section from Andy and Woo, the sitcoms got in on exploring just why certain characters could be friends as the gang had to face what to do with unexpected wedding guest Gary Blauman on this week's How I Met Your Mother and Community had the Study Group played a game of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons to reunite Professor Hickey with his son played by David Cross. Then, Nico brought things home with the Rundown Section where he reviewed The Walking Dead, Justified, The Americans and Grimm.</description>

                    <description>Howdy ATA Listeners, this week we are celebrating the return of Once upon a Time by asking the question who's afraid of &amp;nbsp;the Wicked Witch? Well, I can certainly say there's nothing that can make me go Lions, Tigers and Bears oh my more than Storybrooke's newest resident but do you want to know what's more frightening? Andy's impression of the Witch's wicked laugh, which you will all get to experience if he didn't cut it out of the episode. Then again, if the laugh was left on the cutting room floor believe me when I say it's frightening as Andy doing the laugh for our friend on The Helicarrier Podcast,&amp;nbsp;Siike Donnelly left the poor guy running scared.
Anyway, in addition to Once upon a Time, we've got a shorter schedule of reviews that include The Following, Intelligence, Glee, Psych, Revolution, How I Met Your Mother with an extended voicemail from Woo, New Girl, Modern Family, Community and The Big Bang Theory. Also as always we've got the Airwaves Rundown Section where Nico reviews The Walking Dead, Justified, The Americans, Elementary and Grimm in addition to giving us a watch or not suggestion on the new NBC sitcom Growing Up Fisher.</description>

Well, as the song goes absolutely nothing but for DC Nation Podcast Week 68 it's worth a whole lot as we review the animated film Justice League War. Although, our thoughts on the introduction to The New 52 version of the DC Animated Universe isn't all you're going to get from this episode as Michael and I discuss some big DC News Headlines surrounding the upcoming Gotham and The Flash TV Shows including the reveal of Flash's new costume as well as the launch of the official Gotham website, which features the series' logo.</description>

Britt) as they join Agent Coulson and his team as they try to find a cure for Skye. But big things are revealed during the search as Coulson makes a shocking discovery.

                    <description>Hey DC Nation fans and welcome back to the show! I know we've been off air for quite some time, but due to scheduling, sickness, being out of town, and lack of new material to cover, we have been on a longer hiatus than anticipated. Nevertheless, we have returned and will be coming out with new episodes on a more frequent basis.
On this episode, we cover the last two episodes of Beware the Batman Season 1, Part 1 with the episodes "Ascension" and "Fall". We talk about Batman and his villains, Magpie, what Batman fears he could become, Alfred and his role/past, Katana, Ra's al Ghul, the Soultaker sword, and why we need to see the rest of this season...&amp;nbsp;We also discuss our buddy Giancarlo Volpe's most recent DC Comics production with JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time! Now don't worry, we'll end up talking about Justice League: War, but JLAATIT is definitely the more kid-friendly Justice League feature that you'll be able to watch with your child right after you finish Beware the Batman. It's all good stuff.
We also briefly discuss Batman: Arkham Knight, the Arrow spin-off - The Flash, the most recent Gotham casting, and other DC related topics that may catch your eye. All this and more on the most recent episode of the DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey Arrowheads! Welcome back! On this week's episode of Longbow Hunters, Michael and Woo start you all off with a brief discussion on Grant Gustin's The Flash costume that is to be used in the upcoming Arrow spin-off series starring the Fastest Man Alive (yes, this implies that Barry Allen will come out of his coma, so don't be worried about him)! The duo also discuss superhero costumes in general and what looks best on television and film.
However that is not the main topic of the week as the boys also review the latest episode of Arrow - Season 2 entitled "Time of Death"! They talk about the Clock King, Laurel, Dinah, Sin's origin, the flashbacks, Slade's role in the present, and Felicity as she pertains to Team Arrow. Not to mention this week's exciting DC Universe Easter Eggs including references to Blue Devil, Blue Beetle, and Batman &amp;amp; Robin! Plus, we had Lauren be this week's Godsend as she picks up Michael's slack on the Twitter end of things.
All this and more, SPOILERS, on the latest episode of Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this episode is all about spores, molds, fungus and TV Shows as we tribute the week's reviews on our favorite programs like&amp;nbsp; The Following, Castle, Almost Human, Intelligence, Supernatural, Person of Interest, Revolution, Psych, How I Met Your Mother, New Girl, Modern Family, Community and The Big Bang Theory to one of Entertainment's best comedy writers/directors, Harold Ramis who tragically passed away last week leaving us with one less Ghostbuster in the world.
In addition to our regular reviews, we have a special News with Nico section discussing our love for Harold Ramis' films such as National Lampoon's Vacation, Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, Analyze This and of course Ghostbusters with the help of audio from the man himself. Then we wrap this episode all up with an Airwaves Rundown Section where Nico gives you a watch or not verdict on the new shows Mixology, Mindgames and About a Boy while reviewing old favorites such as The Walking Dead, Justified, The Americans, Elementary and Grimm.</description>

I promise that Longbow Hunters won't be at all affected by this, as the next episode will still be released this Sunday. On this episode of&amp;nbsp;Tangent Time, Woo and I cover this years&amp;nbsp;Super Bowl, including commercials, trailers, and what we are and are not excited for. Lots of&amp;nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&amp;nbsp;talk in this episode, so if you don't want to run the risk of being spoiled, this one is not for you! And of course, there is some&amp;nbsp;Amazing Spider-Man 2&amp;nbsp;as well ("say whaaaat?"). Then Michael is put on the spot twice on this episode as he first talks about his experience with&amp;nbsp;Frozen&amp;nbsp;as well as how he feels about&amp;nbsp;Supernatural's interpretation of Cain from the Bible. There's also some talk on what is a reboot and what is a re-imagination, all inspired by the new&amp;nbsp;RoboCop&amp;nbsp;film!&amp;nbsp;Iron Man 3, The Mandarin,&amp;nbsp;Batman vs. Superman, Green Lantern, and the&amp;nbsp;definition of a geek&amp;nbsp;vs a nerd are just a few more of the topics we talk about on the latest edition of&amp;nbsp;It's Tangent Time!</description>

Yes, that's right we're taking it easy like a Sunday Morning since the Television hiatus caused by the Olympics left us with only four shows to review for the week as in The Following, Castle, Almost Human and Intelligence. However, taking it easy doesn't mean were dropping the ball as we've got a great News with Nico section for you that has some LEGO fun and stirs up some NBC controversy. In addition, we top the show off with Nico's Airwaves Rundown Section Review on the most recent episode of The Walking Dead that you won't want to miss.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week of television we got to review our favorite shows bringing out the big guns as in the giant freakin' laser attached to the Death Star with its March of the Guest Stars, which was so epic, it even knocked couch potatoes off the couch. Yes that's right, TV Producers let us as the audience behold the power of their contacts as Fringe's Lance Riddick kicked off the week as the CIA Director threatening Gabriel's freedom on Intelligence, Supernatural brought back DJ Qualls as Garth with a surprise transformation, Psych ended Anthony Michael Hall's guest run as&amp;nbsp; crazy Chief Trout and Bret Michaels was brought in for a cameo on Revolution to have some fun with its post-apocalyptic world.
However, what really stole the show on the guest stars were the sitcoms as How I Met Your Mother's season-long guest star Cristin Milioti made waiting 200 episodes for Ted to fall in love with the mother worthwhile, Nathan Filion headlined the celebrity cameos on a&amp;nbsp; hilariously random episode of Community and The Big Bang Theory brought on the voice of the Dark Lord himself, James Earl Jones for the best TV sitcom guest appearance of the year. Beyond that, we bring in our very own special guest star, Andy to help cover The Following and Nico rounds things out with the Airwaves Rundown section covering Justified, Enlisted and Black Sails.</description>

                    <description>Happy 2014&amp;nbsp;gang! Welcome back to&amp;nbsp;Across the Airwaves' very own&amp;nbsp;LONGBOW HUNTERS: THE ARROW PODCAST! Remember us? It's okay if you don't, we've been gone for a while, but&amp;nbsp;we're back&amp;nbsp;and we're here to stay, at least for now!
Due to&amp;nbsp;Michael&amp;nbsp;being in Israel for two weeks and&amp;nbsp;Woo&amp;nbsp;being a bit under the weather, we got a few episodes behind in our coverage of our favorite show on television. Therefore, on this episode, the Dynamic Duo returns to cover the mid-season premiere of&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Season 2&amp;nbsp;"Blast Radius" as well as the following two episodes "Blind Spot" AND "Tremors"!
The guys also cover the trailer to the next episode of Arrow entitled "Heir to the Demon", though unfortunately due to all the episodes needing to be covered this week, the guys&amp;nbsp;did not&amp;nbsp;read Twitter's thoughts on the last few episodes. Sorry guys. Anyway, be back next week for our next episode of the&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters Podcast!</description>

Then we round things out with our very own supporting character, the Airwaves Rundown where my very own sidekick Nico gives us the lowdown on new episodes of Justified, Enlisted, Grimm and the new Starz series Black Sails.</description>

However, this wasn't the final slap we took for the sake of this episode as Nico had to deliver the goods in the Airwaves Rundown Section where he reviewed Justified, Enlisted, Grimm and the new SyFy Channel show Helix.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's edition of ATA, Nico and I prove why Matt Smith should be telling the entertainment business don't you&amp;nbsp; forget about me as we review the 2013 Doctor Who Christmas Special marking his departure from the show. In addition, to the review we also discuss how Matt Smith redefined the role while talking about the legacy he and David Tennant left behind which Peter Capaldi now must uphold.&amp;nbsp; However, our speculation for the future doesn't just stop with Doctor Who as our News with Nico section reveals our thoughts on the casting of Paul Rudd as Marvel's Antman and the alter ego of the DC Superhero Vibe being a main character on the upcoming Flash series for The CW. So with that, what are you waiting for use the links below as your key to open up a fun filled but yet sentimental TARDIS ride of a podcast, which I assure you is much bigger on the inside.</description>

From discussing why&amp;nbsp;Cartoon Network&amp;nbsp;cancels good shows (and what&amp;nbsp;Greg Wiesman&amp;nbsp;is doing next) to the first halves of the current seasons of&amp;nbsp;Supernatural&amp;nbsp;Season 9 and&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;Season 2 (and grieving two characters deaths...) to the&amp;nbsp;Amazing Spider-Man 2&amp;nbsp;(Rise of&amp;nbsp;Electro) trailer! Not to mention the&amp;nbsp;4 most important moments in comic book history... The duo discuss why some people like&amp;nbsp;Thor&amp;nbsp;better than&amp;nbsp;Captain America&amp;nbsp;and vice-versa as well as why&amp;nbsp;Ant-Man&amp;nbsp;should NOT be a&amp;nbsp;comedic&amp;nbsp;film and why he should have been in&amp;nbsp;The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Woo also talks about looking forward to&amp;nbsp;Daredevil&amp;nbsp;once more as well as discusses where the&amp;nbsp;Punisher&amp;nbsp;should come into play with the&amp;nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe. Finally, the show is wrapped up in a nice clean bow when the guys talk about their favorite&amp;nbsp;Christmas&amp;nbsp;flicks and wish you all a&amp;nbsp;Merry Christmas&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;Happy New Year! So strap into your&amp;nbsp;delorean, this baby's about to hit&amp;nbsp;88, and when it does you'll know that&amp;nbsp;It's Tangent Time!</description>

Unfortunately it is a little late due to people being sick over the weekend and others having school finals to take care of, but we're back for this special&amp;nbsp;mid-season finale&amp;nbsp;episode before we head back off to hiatus-land!
On this week's episode,&amp;nbsp;Dan&amp;nbsp;joins Woo and Michael once again to talk about the second part of the&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Season 2&amp;nbsp;mid-season finale (and second&amp;nbsp;Geoff Johns&amp;nbsp;co-written&amp;nbsp;Barry Allen&amp;nbsp;episode) "Three Ghosts"! We talk about&amp;nbsp;Oliver's secret,&amp;nbsp;The Flash's origin,&amp;nbsp;Diggle's role on&amp;nbsp;Team Arrow, who&amp;nbsp;Laurel&amp;nbsp;could become by the season's end,&amp;nbsp;Roy/Thea/Sin,&amp;nbsp;Felicity&amp;nbsp;and Barry,&amp;nbsp;Solomon Grundy,&amp;nbsp;Shado's unfortunate demise, and&amp;nbsp;Slade Wilson&amp;nbsp;aka&amp;nbsp;Deathstroke the Terminator!
Not to mention this week's look at this episode's&amp;nbsp;DC Universe Easter Eggs&amp;nbsp;and the finale to the 6-part CW/Bose commercial series "Blood Rush" starring Roy and Felicity! Oddly enough there are&amp;nbsp;no spoilers&amp;nbsp;in this week's episode as we head off to break, but before we go, we at the&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters Podcast, as well as the whole&amp;nbsp;Across the Airwaves Podcast Network, wish all&amp;nbsp;you&amp;nbsp;listeners, and your families, a&amp;nbsp;Merry Christmas&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;Happy New Year!</description>

                    <description>Hey guys! This episode has been a long time coming and has been in development for quite a while, but with announcements of new X-Men films, Amazing Spider-Man trailers, Barry Allen being on Arrow, and Wonder Woman castings, we decided we needed to not only record but get this episode out to you ASAP!
First on the docket we have our final ZERO YEAR tie-ins to cover! We talk about John Layman's CATWOMAN #25 and Francis Manapul's FINAL issue of The Flash (and Zero Year tie-in) in THE FLASH #25! We discuss what why the New 52 Catwoman book hasn't been the best and why the only issues we really enjoyed were tie-ins, not to mention all of our talk on Manapul's Flash book where we discuss not just this tie-in issue, but bits and pieces of his whole run on the series. Oh, and Barry kisses Iris! On top of that, we also covered the entirety of the SMALLVILLE: TITANS arc (aka Smallville Season 11 Special #4) which pays homage to fans of Young Justice, Teen Titans, and Super Friends!
However, this is NOT the main event of our episode as we do something much bigger. Dan and Michael compare, contrast, and give THEIR complete and honest opinions on both DC Comics AND Marvel! From COMICS to ANIMATION to TELEVISION&amp;nbsp;to FILM, the guys talk about what originally made these companies great, the fact that they need each other to stay in business, and why characters like Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, and the X-Men as so well loved today! All this and more on this week's DC Nation!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, our milestone 150th episode of Across the Airwaves is a tribute to Canada because if we didn't have the country of the Maple leaf, the city of Vancouver would never have been built and therefore the TV shows we review couldn't exist since there would be no place to film them. Then again, not all the shows we cover are filmed in Vancouver but I'm sure through using IMDb and entertainment resources of the like you could a way of associating this shows we cover on ATA to Canada through a guest star or making a ton of jokes about the country like on How I Met Your Mother.
In other words, I'm on a roll here so whether this episode brings out your inner Dudley Do Right, Alan Thicke or Robin Sparkles just go with it as we pay tribute to Canada through our main section reviewing Once upon a Time, Almost Human and Supernatural (shows I know for a fact were filmed in Vancouver) as well as our sitcom section going over episodes of How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. Also there's more where that came from as the Airwaves Rundown discusses shows where their connections to Canada might be a stretch but definitely worth our time anyway such as Homeland, The Walking Dead, The Blacklist, South Park, Once upon a Time in Wonderland, The Tomorrow People, TNT's Mob City, Elementary, Glee and Grimm.
By the way, Andy wanted me to mention that if you want more of his thoughts on this week's Once upon a Time check out his spot as a guest host on the Operation Cobra Podcast located here:&amp;nbsp;http://www.operationcobrapodcast.com/2013/12/episode-181-save-henry.html.</description>

                    <description>Hey DC Nationites! On this week's episode of the DC Nation Podcast, Dan &amp;amp; Michael have a lot for you!!!
First off, the guys cover FOREVER EVIL: ROUGES REBELLION #2 which not only ties into Forever Evil #3, but will tie into Forever Evil: Arkham War as well... The boys talk about the Rouges, Mirror Master taking charge(?), Parasite, Poison Ivy, Captain Cold, The Flash TV series, and more!
However, the main event of this episode seems to be more coverage on the BATMAN: ZERO YEAR tie-ins! This week, the tie-in talk includes coverage of the 25th issues of&amp;nbsp;Batgirl, Batwoman, Birds of Prey, Green Lantern Corps, Nightwing, and Red Hood &amp;amp; the Outlaws! The dynamic duo talk Beware the Batman connections, various Black Canary origins, how much they love John Stewart, how Kate Kane and Bruce Wayne are related, Dick Grayson's young heroics, and Jason Todd &amp;amp; the Joker!
But that's not all as the guys don't forget to promote YOUNG JUSTICE: LEGACY! The long-anticipated Young Justice video game, that bridges the 5 year gap between Season 1 and Season 2 of the incredible animated series, is out now! Fans of DC Nation, DC Comics, our podcast, and most certainly Young Justice should make buying this game (and playing it of course) a priority as it may eventually help resurrect the show in some form. All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

This week, Andy and Siike reviews the ninth episode "Repairs" which gave the fans of&amp;nbsp;Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;a deeper look into Agent Melinda May's (Ming-Na Wen) past and what made her the person that she is today as they were dealing with a victim trapped between realms through a mystical force.
But before that, they also discuss the fantastic news regarding the ratings boost that&amp;nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;got this week and they also discuss the comics of the weeks in the comic section.

However, there may be a&amp;nbsp;Helicarrier Special&amp;nbsp;next week while the show is on its short break.

And of course, we talk Red Hood One, the Joker, the Riddler, and even Doctor Death!
Plus, we also discuss Jim Gordon, Luke Fox, Clark Kent, and Oliver Queen's roles in Zero Year with discussion on the ZY tie-in issues (all #25) of Action Comics, Batwing, Detective Comics, and Green Arrow!
But that's still not all folks as we finally finish our weekly coverage of the SMALLVILLE series of books with Smallville Season 11 #69 "Olympus, Part 12". Here we talk "Alien", Wonder Woman, Season 11 as a whole, and more. Don 'to worry though, we'll still be covering Smallville, but from now on we'll be doing it by PRINT issue instead if digital as we have been.
All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey Listeners, let me to you about this week's podcast, which believe it or not is walking on air as we review episodes of our favorite TV shows paying tribute to unlikely heroes. You know people like the Little Mermaid on Once upon a Time, Richard Castle the novelist who has a knack for solving real-life mysteries, the former Angel making slushies at the minimart on Supernatural, Person of Interest's single mother working as a street cop and the wacky uncle who proved his outrageous stories were true on The Legend of Korra. Oh and let's not forget the crazy ones&amp;nbsp; who found themselves on top of the world thinking the hero should be someone else such as the mother we've waited to meet who tamed ladies man Barney Stinson, the housewife that gave her husband Chinese Acrobats for a gift on Modern Family and the physics professor who wore an extremely itchy sweater to maintain his integrity on The Big Bang Theory.
Then we continued flying away on a wing and a prayer into our Airwaves Rundown section unveiling more unlikely heroes where that came from with our reviews on Homeland, The Walking Dead, Sleepy Hollow, The Blacklist, New Girl, South Park, Revolution, Once upon a Time in Wonderland, The Tomorrow People, Elementary, Grimm and Glee. So with all this great content coming your way I've got to ask who could this podcast be? Well, believe it or not it's just&amp;nbsp; ATA.</description>

On the news section this week, they discuss the upcoming appearance of Marvels'&amp;nbsp;Agent Victoria Hand on&amp;nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;and the big announcement that&amp;nbsp;Marvel and Netflix are developing four shows&amp;nbsp;(Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist&amp;nbsp;and the mini-series&amp;nbsp;The Defenders) for 2015.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, since you are those who love TV that rocks we are going to salute you by going somewhere over the rainbow with Andy joining me to review a highflying Once upon a Time and then Nico stepping in for our reviews on Castle, a fun filled Wizard Of Oz themed Supernatural, Person of Interest and a Legend of Korra episode that said we certainly aren't in Kansas anymore as she traveled to the spirit world. We also finish the main part of our podcast off with a shortened Sitcom Section featuring thoughts on this week's How I Met Your Mother from the wonderful wizard known as Woo.
Although, our following of the yellow brick road doesn't stop there as we've got a Rundown Section featuring reviews on Homeland, The Walking Dead,&amp;nbsp; The Blacklist, South Park, Revolution, The Tomorrow People, Elementary and Grimm. Then we wrap up the show once again off to see the Wizard, the wonderful wizard of Woo as he presents us with a another voicemail on Once upon a Time. So with all this great stuff coming your way, tap the screen of your ruby iPhone or Android device to be reminded that there's no place like Across the Airwaves for television reviews along with Nico's news.</description>

                    <description>Hello good and faithful DC Nationites! On this week's episode, Dan and Michael (finally) cover FOREVER EVIL #2! The duo have some great discussion on Lex Luthor, the Crime Syndicate, Bizarro, Otis (poor Otis...), the current state of the Justice League and more! But that's not all as they also cover two of the three major Forever Evil tie-ins: Arkham War and Rouges Rebellion! Here they talk about the war between Penguin and Bane and what Bane's real motives are, why the Rouges are really the most heroic villains out there, and what makes Forever Evil such a big event. Also, all is revealed as we get Ultraman's origin in Justice League #24, which the guys also make sure to cover.
Unfortunately, that's not all as we have some sad news for all of you DC Nation fans. History has repeated itself as Cartoon Network has taken BEWARE THE BATMAN off of the air until January 2014! &amp;nbsp;Not only do we take the first 10-15 minutes of this podcast to inform you about it (as well as rant), but we also tell you how you can support this show!
Finally, the Caped Crusaders cover Parts 10 and 11 of SMALLVILLE SEASON 11's "Olympus" arc (which is almost concluded) and Michael gives all of you more and more reason to buy the recently released Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - Deluxe Edition Blu-Ray/DVD Combo-Pack! All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I wish we could find a way to have Nico's head bounce across the lyrics but here's the description of this week's podcast episode set to the tune of the song Howard sang to Bernadette on this week's Big Bang Theory so get ready to sing along&amp;hellip;
If I didn't have the tube, Nico I would have never met you, I'd be Once upon a Time, without Neverland.
A Castle without a Beckett, Reese without a Finch, I'd be an Avatar, without bending.
I'd never meet the mother, Woo couldn't deal with that. I'd be solving&amp;nbsp; domestic situations without Modern Family references making someone like the Big Bang Theory's Sheldon much harder to crack...
I'd be chasing down Blacklisters without Red, the power like on Revolution would be dead, and we wouldn't have a podcast without the tube.
[All:] And we wouldn't have a podcast without the tube.
Ever since i met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes.
You're like Kenny, and dying, a South Park TV trope...
I couldn't have imagined, how many Walking Dead Zombies my life would get... From the moment that I met you, Television tube.
If I didn't have you, Supernatural wouldn't be scary. We'd be hunting Vessen, without a Grimm.
I'd be Homeland, without a traitor. A Andy Behbakht, without a Glee section.
I'd be Longbow Hunters, DC Nation and It's Tangent Time without Michael. I'd speak a lot more kryptonian, "Heghlu'meh QaQ jajvam"
And we wouldn't have a podcast without the tube!
[All:] Oh we couldn't even imagine, not having Across the Airwaves... Because we couldn't have a podcast, without the tube...
&amp;nbsp;And if our sing-along description as you completely lost in left field, let me translate our crazy for you by explaining this week's episode reviews Once upon a Time, Castle, Supernatural, Person of Interest, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and a hour length Legend of Korra episode unveiling the origins of the Avatar. Then in the Rundown Section, we cover Homeland, The Blacklist, Revolution, The Tomorrow People, The Walking Dead&amp;nbsp; and much more. So what are you waiting for? If you love television, listen to this ATA episode because like the tube, we also wouldn't have a podcast without you&amp;hellip;</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, Nico is leaving. Yes, he is leaving on the Midnight Train to great television. Actually, as you will hear in the background it's more like a Midnight Car Ride to an undisclosed location as Nico while on the road helps me review this week's episodes of Castle, Person of Interest, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory.&amp;nbsp; Then our ATA Corps hopped on board this crazy train as Andy joined me to review Once upon a Time, Woo shared his thoughts on How I Met Your Mother and Michael joined me to talk Supernatural.
However, the train didn't pull into the station just yet, as we switched tracks to the Airwaves Rundown Section where I reviewed the week's episodes of Sleepy Hollow, The Blacklist, Revolution and Michael joined me for a great conversation on the second episode of The Tomorrow People that was followed by Nico bringing us home with his review on The Walking Dead's season premiere. Also for those of you looking for this week's Legend of Korra review expect a special section next week discussing three episodes mainly focusing on our thoughts about the origin of the Avatar!</description>

                    <description>Attention DC Nationites, there is a new super criminal loose on the streets of Gotham and Police Officials are warning you to beware the Cypher. I repeat, beware the Cypher!&amp;nbsp; According to reports,&amp;nbsp; it's been questioned if he is machine or mannequin but confirmation has been made his parts are from Japan and he is no different than the modern man. Unfortunately, that will not prevent him from using his menacing glowing green tentacles to control your mind. However, we can say domo arigato to scientist Mr. Roboto as he discovered that the answer to protecting yourselves from Cypher's mental attack is listening to this week's DC Nation Podcast featuring our reviews on three Beware the Batman episodes (Control, Sacrifice and Instinct), Smallville Season 11 #65&amp;ndash;66 Olympus Chapters 8 &amp;amp; 9 and Michael's suggestions on the Villains Month Comics you should read. So what are you waiting for beware the Cypher and listen to this episode for your own safety from a guy who even puts the Meteor Freak Creepers from Smallville to shame.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's podcast Angels falling from the sky in a blaze of glory marked the return of Supernatural to our regular slate of reviews while I teamed up with a cohost rotation made up of Nico, Andy and Woo to light up some fire of our own as we covered new episodes of Once upon a Time, Castle, Person of Interest, The Legend of Korra, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. However, that's not all the fuel we put on the fire as we use the Airwaves Rundown section to give our two cents on Homeland, Sleepy Hollow, Hostages, The Blacklist, Brooklyn Nine&amp;ndash;Nine, The Goldbergs, the series premiere of The Tomorrow People, Revolution, The Crazy Ones and much more.
Also for those of you looking for this week's Glee review keep an eye out for a separate ATA Special Edition episode hosted by Andy and Woo designated towards having a more in-depth conversation on the Cory Monteith tribute.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I've got a riddle for you, as a potato's key tool, I have all the power. I am generally used on the half or full hour. If my cells were deceased or lost or the such, Only my partner would respond to your touch. What am I? Well if your clever like the Raj on The Big Bang Theory or his pal The Riddler, you would have guessed the TV remote control. A tool that helped Nico and I go scavenger hunting for America in search of great television, airing this week with our reviews on the season premiere of Once upon a Time, Castle, Person of Interest, The Legend of Korra, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory. Then we got a little lost on our hunt for good television with the Airwaves Rundown as we covered several terrible sitcom pilots but we ended up turning things around with reviews on Homeland, Sleepy Hollow, The Goldbergs, New Girl, Brooklyn Nine&amp;ndash;Nine, Hostages, Revolution, Elementary and much, much more including The Blacklist where Elizabeth Keen wanted to reach out with a pen to stab me and then you&amp;hellip; So Sweet Caroline give this episode a listen because good times have never been so good!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, guess who just got back today? Our favorite TV shows that had been away. Changes have been made since finales came our way. But man, I still think, how we met the mother was crazy. This week we learned if Castle's muse is still around, tell you Person of Interest moved and where it can be found. Modern Family is scoring from Emmy downtown and Sheldon is driving the cast of Big Bang Theory crazy because (everybody sing)&amp;nbsp; THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN! THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!
I said the boys are back in town, so spread the word around as Nico and I also throw in a review on The Legend of Korra along with a Airwaves Rundown section catching up with returning shows like New Girl, South Park, Elementary and a vastly improved Revolution. In addition, we take a look at some of the pilots for new TV shows including Sleepy Hollow, Hostages, Mom, The Blacklist, Brooklyn Nine&amp;ndash;Nine, The Goldbergs, Back in the Game, The Crazy Ones and The Michael J. Fox Show while Andy and Woo wrap the episode up with their thoughts on Part 1 of Glee's Beatles themed season premiere.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast smells like teen spirit as we begin our reviews on Book Two of The Legend of Korra with the first three episodes (Rebel Spirit, The Northern Lights and Civil Wars Part 1) where our favorite girl Avatar was being the typical teenager rebelling against her parents, Tenzin and even her boyfriend Mako until he set her straight. Then as we head into the Airwaves Rundown, the rebellious streak continues for some of our favorite TV characters/personalities with us reviewing the Burn Notice Season Finale where Michael turned on the CIA, Seth Green's sitcom about his relationship with a dysfunctional father called Dads and the New Girl gangs trip across the border to cause trouble in Mexico. Also Nico may also possibly answer the question that's been plaguing us all summer, how to get out from Under the Dome. So&amp;nbsp; if you're feeling a rebellious spirit, have nostalgia for your teenaged days or love rocking out to Nirvana give this podcast a listen because it starts the Fall TV Season out with a firebending bang!</description>

Hello DC Nationites! On this weeks episode, Dan and Michael discuss The Flash, Green Arrow, Katana, Batgirl, Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman! That's right, your favorite superheroes all in one place! Starting off with some DC Headlines, the duo give their thoughts on the casting of Grant Gustin as Michael's favorite Flash, Barry Allen, for this coming season of Arrow. Jumping into their main event, the two review and discuss the Beware the Batman episode "Allies" where they talk Barbara Gordon, Katana, Outsiders, Ghosts, Batman, the Bat-Signal, and much more with their exciting back-and-forth! As always, they also review Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville Season 11 with this past week's issue of the "Olympus" arc as well as their thoughts on Smallville turning into a mini-series as opposed to a continuous series as it is now. And finally, the guys give their recommendations for the last few week's Villain's Month titles that DC Comics has been putting out to celebrate Forever Evil. All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>On this exciting episode of&amp;nbsp;Tangent Time, Michael &amp;amp; Woo are joined by none-other than fellow ATA member&amp;nbsp;Andy Behbakht, on this special superhero themed episode (but aren't they all?)!!! On this week's episode, the gang (going in the Longbow Hunters direction) talks about the news that Glee's&amp;nbsp;Grant Gustin&amp;nbsp;will be playing&amp;nbsp;Barry Allen&amp;nbsp;aka&amp;nbsp;The Flash&amp;nbsp;this season on&amp;nbsp;Arrow! On top of that, the guys reminisce back to twenty years ago (before some of us were even born...) when&amp;nbsp;Lois &amp;amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&amp;nbsp;first appeared and talk about how the television series actually shaped the&amp;nbsp;Superman&amp;nbsp;comic books. Speaking of comic books, Woo throws it out there that he doesn't think that comic books are as good or as "exciting" as they used to be, sending the group into a large and extensive discussion about&amp;nbsp;the New 52,&amp;nbsp;Marvel Now, and the comic book industry in general! There is also some interesting talk about the ninth season of&amp;nbsp;Supernatural&amp;nbsp;by Michael &amp;amp; Woo and Michael proceeds to plus&amp;nbsp;MTV's Spider-Man&amp;nbsp;animated series from the early 2000nds to anyone who will listen. All this and more on this weeks podcast:&amp;nbsp;IT'S TANGENT TIME!!!</description>

On our last episodes, we covered all six episodes of&amp;nbsp;Beware the Batman&amp;nbsp;that had aired prior to recording... But on this episode, we return to covering the Bat with the majorly important episode "Family"! We talk&amp;nbsp;Katana, we talk&amp;nbsp;Alfred, we talk&amp;nbsp;Lady Shiva&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Silver Monkey, and of course, we talk&amp;nbsp;Batman! But don't worry fans of&amp;nbsp;Bryan Q. Miller, we're not nearly finished as we also cover&amp;nbsp;Smallville Season 11's "Olympus" (Chapter 6) and "Hollow" (Chapter 4) arcs in detail where we talk about&amp;nbsp;Superman,&amp;nbsp;Wonder Woman,&amp;nbsp;Lois Lane, CorTessa, and of course&amp;nbsp;Lex Luthor.
But that's not all folks, as before we even cover anything I just mentioned above,&amp;nbsp;Dan and Michael&amp;nbsp;dig deep into DC Comics biggest&amp;nbsp;Justice League&amp;nbsp;story since&amp;nbsp;Throne of Atlantis,&amp;nbsp;Geoff Johns&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Jeff Lemire's&amp;nbsp;TRINITY WAR! We talk&amp;nbsp;Pandora, we talk Flashpoint, we talk the outcome and everything that lead up to it. We also give&amp;nbsp;Ivan Reis&amp;nbsp;props for his amazing artwork on the arc which spanned from Justice League to&amp;nbsp;Justice League of America&amp;nbsp;to even&amp;nbsp;Justice League Dark, therefore uniting the three Leagues for the very first time in the&amp;nbsp;New 52&amp;nbsp;universe! I bet the&amp;nbsp;JL International&amp;nbsp;kids feel left out...
Spanning out of Trinity War, the Duo also discuss the biggest DC Comics crossover even since Final Crisis:&amp;nbsp;FOREVER EVIL!&amp;nbsp;Where the guys talk issue one of this groundbreaking Geoff Johns written,&amp;nbsp;David Finch&amp;nbsp;drawn, epic that will shake the&amp;nbsp;DC Universe&amp;nbsp;for years to come.&amp;nbsp;Ultraman, Lex Luthor,&amp;nbsp;Nightwing,&amp;nbsp;the Rouges,&amp;nbsp;Batgirl, Teen Titans, Owlman,&amp;nbsp;Grid, the&amp;nbsp;Crime Syndicate, the&amp;nbsp;Atom, and much more!

Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's podcast episode we are reviewing the final four episodes of Season 2 for SyFy/Showcase's Continuum with all the discussion you could want on the all the doublecrossing, action, mindbending time travel theories and duck calls that make the show great. Wait a minute, did I just say duck calls? You've got it, jack! As we don't just cover sci-fi on this episode but Si the man himself as we are happy, happy, happy to add Duck Dynasty to our slate of reviews, covering the hit TV show in the same fashion as our sitcoms. On that note, some of you (including the members of our ATA Corps) might think we've gone&amp;nbsp; quackers lowering ourselves down to covering a Reality Show when we've directed so much hatred towards them but we've got good reason to cover Duck Dynasty since the guys behind the show are putting a positive spin on television's trashiest genre with the intent of making America a better place. So for more on this controversial addition to our slate of reviews and a ton of fun discussing our crackpot theories for Continuum with a surprise guest host, you better come running as fast as you can, cause all the girls are going crazy for this SHARP DRESSED PODCAST!</description>

                    <description>Hello all you film junkies, comic book nerds, and superhero fanatics, welcome/welcome back to Across the Airwaves Presents... IT'S TANGENT TIME! On this highly anticipated episode of Tangent Time, Michael &amp;amp; Woo talk about the upcoming Brain Singer film X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST once again in a big discussion on why Chris Claremont is the definitive X-Men writer outside of Stan Lee as well as the one who should be credited for making Wolverine who he is today. We also talk a bit about some of our highly anticipated Fall 2013 television shows including Arrow, Supernatural, and MARVEL's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.! And going off of our last episode's discussion about film composers, the Dynamic Duo go in-depth on how they feel about Hans Zimmer as a composer to the point where the scores from THE DARK KNIGHT and MAN OF STEEL are compared. But speaking of The World's Finest Superheroes, because of the big news that came out regarding the upcoming Batman/Superman film (in theaters July 17, 2015), thoughts and opinions are shared about the choice to cast Ben Affleck as Batman, and here's a hint, they're not necessarily negative. All this and more on the latest episode of Tangent Time!</description>

                    <description>Greetings and salutations DC Nationites! I am in a heroicly boastful mood today as we escaped the destruction of Krypton, investigated the streets of Gotham City, navigated Space Sector 666 and battled alongside the Justice League to create one of the biggest DC Nation Podcast Adventures of 2013. And in the words of Aquaman from Batman: The Brave and the Bold, we are going to call it&amp;hellip;
Dan and Michael's Rousing Coverage of Comic Con 2013!!!
Yes, it's finally here old chums, our coverage of everything to do with DC Comics at Comic Con 2013, most notably the variety of panels where writers and artists discussed what's to come in our favorite DC Comic Books. However, covering the panels was really just a guideline as Michael and I used this episode as an opportunity to lay all of our opinions regarding our favorite superhero characters in their current state out onto the table. In fact, our conversation&amp;nbsp; got so in-depth we had to divide this podcast into two parts with the first installment, which is a part of this blog post covering the DC Comics: All Access, DC Digital, Justice League: Trinity War and The New 52 Panels as well as featuring a discussion on my fears about Marvel's debut of the Superior Spider-Man (Dr. Octopus possessing Spider-Man's) having negative effects on future DC stories.
Then with the second part it becomes a little more character focused as we discuss the Batman: Zero Year, Green Lantern Recharged!, Superman: The New 52 Era and DC Comics: Meet the Co-Publishers Panels while throwing in our thoughts on The World's Finest movie. So with my assurance that this isn't the trap of a dastardly villain, I ask you the question are you a man who is going to let one of the greatest comic book conversations I've had with Michael pass you by or are you a Superman who will embrace your inner geek by listening to this entire episode?</description>

                    <description>Hey DC Nationites, did you happen to catch the movie with Gerard Butler that came out in the spring called Olympus Has Fallen? Well, in terms of the Smallville universe Olympus is rising as Clark and Lois visit Washington DC where they meet the first superheroine in her white tights, fighting for our rights and the old red, white and blue, Wonder Woman! Wait a minute, that's not right. It should be satin tights but that's not what the artwork shows, as Diana has got her bracelets but she does her heroing in a white jumpsuit instead of the traditional Wonder Woman costume but some future cover artwork showed that it's coming&amp;nbsp; but at this part of the story, the Amazon Princess isn't quite the full-fledged Wonder Woman just yet as we think she's in The Blur stage in achieving her destiny.
Anyway, with this episode's review of Smallville Season 11 Digital Issues #56&amp;ndash;58: Olympus Chapters 1&amp;ndash;3 otherwise known as Smallville Season 11 Print Issue #16 we talk about the decisions Bryan made to give Wonder Woman a Smallville twist comparing it to our frustration over Superman and Wonder Woman having a romance in The New 52. However, don't think that's all we talked about as we&amp;nbsp; formed theories on how many of Bryan's ideas behind the Smallville version&amp;nbsp; of Wonder Woman could be used in a live-action film. We also discussed how seeing Martha Kent again was able to recapture the sense of nostalgia for previous seasons that made the Season 9 episode Hostage so successful and how the mentioning of Connor Kent a.k.a. Superboy going to a school in San Francisco for superpowered teens makes us want to see a side story featuring the Smallville version of the Teen Titans with Cyborg as their teacher.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, we are re-releasing our fixed version of Part II of our Comic Con Coverage where we've navigated our TARDIS through timestream of news, made a recording using salvaged Sentinel technology and edited like a World's Finest team to bring you one of the biggest Across The Airwaves events of the year covering the biggest Entertainment Industry event of the year our 2013 San Diego Comic Con Special! Yep folks, I know it's been a long time coming but the big granddaddy ATA episode of them all covering just about everything we discuss on this podcast is here and this time parts of it is coming from Nico on the Comic Con floor as he goes over the panels revealing what's to come from our favorite shows returning in the Fall/Spring such as Psych, The Big Bang Theory, Defiance, The Legend of Korra, Bones, Game of Thrones, How I Met Your Mother, Revolution, Person of Interest, Warehouse 13, Arrow, Once upon a Time and The Following. However, the fun doesn't stop there as we discuss upcoming films like Divergent, Ender's Game, Kick Ass 2, Riddick and the Veronica Mars movie while taking a look at some new shows revealing to you if we will be covering them on ATA or not including SyFy's Helix, CBS's Intelligence, the CW's The 100, the CW's The Tomorrow People, a little bit about Fox's Almost Human, ABC's Agents of Shield and ABC's Once upon a Time in Wonderland.
In fact, this was such a Godzilla sized episode we had to split it into two parts where we used the second part to discuss The Amazing Spiderman 2 Panel and bring Andy in to discuss the panels he actually attended for Seventh Son, Godzilla, Gravity, 300: Rise of an Empire, the World Of Warcraft Movie, The Lego Movie, World's Finest (Superman versus Batman), I, Frankenstein, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, X-Men Days of Future Past, Thor: The Dark World,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant&amp;ndash;Man and Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. We also round things out with Nico and I finishing off our coverage of the Television Panels with Supernatural and Community while having Andy join the party again to go over the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Panel giving our two cents on the actor playing the next Doctor.
So with all of last out-of-the-way (whew, that was a lot of listing), I suggest you all give this podcast that we've all worked very hard on a listen because yes it's a doozy but it will save you hours of shifting through an avalanche of news on the Internet and as an added bonus you get to find out all about what's to come in the next few years for the Entertainment Industry with a few friends who may possibly deliver some laughs along the way.

Oh, and to better enjoy this year's Comic Con episode, I suggest watching the panels that correspond with our discussions on our&amp;nbsp;ATA YouTube Channel under the playlist labeled Comic Con 2013.&amp;nbsp;Also for our coverage related to the panels centering on comic books check out our next episode of the DC Nation Podcast, which will be available sometime next week.</description>

                    <description>On this exciting new Tangent Time Podcast, Michael has a crappy internet connection. No, really he does. So for the times that Michael cuts out, and because they just like having him on, Woo and Michael brought Helicarrier: The [Agents of] S.H.I.E.L.D. Podcast host Andy Behbakht onto this week's show! On this podcast, the trio talk about many of the amazing news to come out of San Diego Comic Con 2013 including news on Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America: The Winter Solider, and The Avengers: Age of Ultron! The Wolverine is also discussed in great deal as well as what we know about X-Men: Days of Future Past; Michael also explains his hatred for Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and briefly touches on which characters were not his favorite in The Avengers. But it doesn't stop there as we continue down the Joss Whedon path to talk about what made Firefly great and why Firefly out of any cancelled TV series got the cult status and a continuation film in the form of Serenity! But good times keep on rolling as talk about why MARVEL's Comics aren't as good arises and of course the long-awaited discussion on the upcoming World's Finest film, the apparent sequel to Man of Steel. All this and much more on this podcast which asks you what time it is? Well, it's Tangent Time of course!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, we've navigated our TARDIS through timestream of news, made a recording using salvaged Sentinel technology and edited like a World's Finest team to bring you one of the biggest Across The Airwaves events of the year covering the biggest Entertainment Industry event of the year our 2013 San Diego Comic Con Special! Yep folks, I know it's been a long time coming but the big granddaddy ATA episode of them all covering just about everything we discuss on this podcast is here and this time parts of it is coming from Nico on the Comic Con floor as he goes over the panels revealing what's to come from our favorite shows returning in the Fall/Spring such as Psych, The Big Bang Theory, Defiance, The Legend of Korra, Bones, Game of Thrones, How I Met Your Mother, Revolution, Person of Interest, Warehouse 13, Arrow, Once upon a Time and The Following. However, the fun doesn't stop there as we discuss upcoming films like Divergent, Ender's Game, Kick Ass 2, Riddick and the Veronica Mars movie while taking a look at some new shows revealing to you if we will be covering them on ATA or not including SyFy's Helix, CBS's Intelligence, the CW's The 100, the CW's The Tomorrow People, a little bit about Fox's Almost Human, ABC's Agents of Shield and ABC's Once upon a Time in Wonderland.
In fact, this was such a Godzilla sized episode we had to split it into two parts where we used the second part to discuss The Amazing Spiderman 2 Panel and bring Andy in to discuss the panels he actually attended for Seventh Son, Godzilla, Gravity, 300: Rise of an Empire, the World Of Warcraft Movie, The Lego Movie, World's Finest (Superman versus Batman), I, Frankenstein, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, X-Men Days of Future Past, Thor: The Dark World,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant&amp;ndash;Man and Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. We also round things out with Nico and I finishing off our coverage of the Television Panels with Supernatural and Community while having Andy join the party again to go over the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Panel giving our two cents on the actor playing the next Doctor.
So with all of last out-of-the-way (whew, that was a lot of listing), I suggest you all give this podcast that we've all worked very hard on a listen because yes it's a doozy but it will save you hours of shifting through an avalanche of news on the Internet and as an added bonus you get to find out all about what's to come in the next few years for the Entertainment Industry with a few friends who may possibly deliver some laughs along the way.
Oh, and to better enjoy this year's Comic Con episode, I suggest watching the panels that correspond with our discussions on our ATA YouTube Channel under the playlist labeled Comic Con 2013. Also for our coverage related to the panels centering on comic books check out our next episode of the DC Nation Podcast, which will be available sometime next week.</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, the hosts of the DC Nation Podcast (Michael and myself) remember you, but do you remember us? Well, hopefully in the words of musician Sarah McLachlan you haven't let life with this podcast pass you by since we don't want to get lost in your memories as we are back to catch up on our Smallville Season 11 Reviews. Yes, we learned the hard way from this episode that time just keeps on slipping into the future but never fear as we are flying like an eagle into getting you caught up on everything Smallville by reviewing the Season 11 Digital Issues #52&amp;ndash;53 Chapters 8 &amp;amp; 9 of Argo and #54&amp;ndash;55 Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 of Hollow. In addition, we also talk about what's ahead for the DC Nation Podcast including reviews on Beware the Batman and our DC themed Comic Con episode covering all the DC Entertainment Panels that took place in San Diego a few weeks ago.</description>

                    <description>Welcome to episode #0 of our brand new podcast -&amp;nbsp;Helicarrier: The S.H.I.E.L.D. Podcast&amp;nbsp;- a co-production between Across the Airwaves (ATA) and ComicBookTherapy.com. This podcast is dedicated to ABC's upcoming series&amp;nbsp;Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;that features the return of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) and the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
While we are anxiously awaiting the show's debut, this episode will introduce you to the hosts of Helicarrier Podcast:&amp;nbsp;Andy Behbakht&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Chris Doucher&amp;nbsp;- who is the Co-Owner and Managing Editor of the comic book news website&amp;nbsp;ComicBookThearpy.com, as well as the newest member of ATA. You'll get to hear these very geeky, but incredibly handsome hosts talk about their backgrounds, things they love related to comics, and of course their excitement for&amp;nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
They'll also share with you their thoughts about everything that they know about Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., based on what was said both during and after the panel at this year's San Diego Comic-Con. Plus, they'll give you the details on some other very exciting Marvel projects that Andy learned about when attending the panel. Okay, we've made you wait long enough, please go ahead and listen to the first official/unofficial episode. And remember, you don't want to miss the series premiere of the show on&amp;nbsp;Tuesday, September 24, 8 PM on ABC.&amp;nbsp;And make sure you follow the podcast&amp;nbsp;@ShieldAssemble&amp;nbsp;on Twitter!&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA Listeners, I know this episode comes somewhat out of order but with Michael and I being on vacation, there was some catching up we had to do on our Continuum watching. So on that note, we ask all of you to just play along with your imaginations as we travel back in time to review not just one but two episodes of Continuum, S02E07 Second Degree and S02E08 Second Listen. In addition, we discuss the advancements in Keira's relationship with Carlos now that he knows she's a time traveler, the back story behind Alec's girlfriend Emily, the quality of SyFy Channel's programming and briefly touch upon new sci-fi shows premiering in the fall such as Fox's Almost Human and CBS's Intelligence.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, now that we have come back from trips to summer camp and Comic Con, this episode is all about getting our podcast back to where it belongs by reviewing our TV favorites that were also in search of some normalcy this week as the Falling Skies Season 3 Finale brought the show back to its roots of battling an alien invasion out on the open road. In addition, Continuum gave us an episode where Keira got on the wrong side of the law making us want to get back to her original war against terrorists from the future, Burn Notice gave us an indication that it's final season is about Michael fighting to get back his sanity and Under the Dome featured its characters wanting to get back some normalcy as the imprisoned citizens of a New England Town run out of food and water.
Also be sure to keep an eye out for our 2013 Comic Con Special, Andy's Comic Con Interviews, Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast's coverage of the Arrow&amp;nbsp; Season 2 Panel, The DC Nation Podcast's Comic Con Special and the premiere of the Helicarrier Podcast dedicated to covering episodes of Marvel's Agents of Shield coming soon or either already posted by our Across The Airwaves Corps</description>

                    <description>Hi ATA Listeners, I know everything has kind of been all over the place with our podcast as I attended the wonderful Camp Horizon (which you can find out about supporting here) Michael visits Montana for the summer and Nico along with Andy went to San Diego Comic Con 2013. In fact, as a result of our travels this episode is going to be shorter than what you're used to expecting since we are only reviewing Falling Skies in our main section as well as two episodes of Burn Notice and Under the Dome in the Airwaves Rundown. Unfortunately, if you're looking for the continuation of our reviews on Continuum you're going to have to wait until Michael's schedule frees up for us to record Episode 135.5, which will cover the past two episodes of Continuum that I missed while being out of town. Although, don't let that make you think this episode is a complete waste of time as News with Nico features some mind blowing TV News that came out of Comic Con, which I'm hoping will put this podcast back in a straightforward direction just like the penultimate episode of Falling Skies shipping the second the 2nd Mass up to Boston for a season ending final showdown with the traitorous Karen.
By the way, keep an eye out for ATA's Comic Con 2013 Special Edition Episodes focusing on the second season of Arrow, Marvel's Agents of Shield, the shows we cover that are returning in the Fall and much, much more.</description>

&amp;nbsp;Hey ATA Listeners, this week Dan goes on vacation to Camp and leaves Nico to take over the podcast like the Superhero he is, or at least the one he Cosplays at Comic Con, as he hosts the entire episode on his own. Although, with both Michael and Dan on vacation, Nico brought in a special guest, his Dad Bill Reifsteck to help discuss this week's episode of Falling Skies, where they discuss the possibility that Tom may still be in another layer of Inception like dream/nightmare or somehow still under the influence of Karen.&amp;nbsp; Then Nico reviews this week's episode of Under the Dome and discusses his excitement with the possibility that the mystery of the Dome may finally lead to that classic Steven King twist we're hoping for, but also how he is disappointed with the scare-of-the-week style episodes we are getting with this show. Also, Nico changed up the format on News with Nico this week as he reported the news and his opinions about the Comic Con panels he attended while there on Friday and Saturday this year.&amp;nbsp; Listen as he reports directly from the Comic Con floor.&amp;nbsp; Come join us in this Superhero effort as Nico host the podcast alone for the first time.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week our favorite summer shows said surprise, surprise as we were shocked by revelations that came from seeing through their character's lies with Paracelsus using Myka's cancer to pull the ultimate doublecross in the Warehouse 13 Season Finale, Keira's secret of being a time traveler threatening her partnership with Carlos on Continuum and Falling Skies revealing the identity of the true mole. In addition, the seeing through characters lies continued in our Airwaves Rundown Section as we reviewed the Defiance Season Finale where the Earth Republic revealed they weren't the saviors Datak used to get himself elected as mayor. Then, I took over to cover a Burn Notice episode that questioned if you can trust a sexy Russian spy, Nico took a crack at just who might not be forthcoming about why the people of a New England town are trapped Under the Dome and Woo gave us his thoughts on a classic example of a story about lies turning things for characters upside down, Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing adapted by the great Joss Whedon.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>It's never easy to accept when an amazing actor on one of your favorite TV shows passes away - last Saturday night (July 13, 2013) it was reported that 31-year old actor Cory Monteith (who portrayed Finn Hudson on FOX's musical show&amp;nbsp;Glee)&amp;nbsp;was sadly found dead in a hotel room in Vancouver. On this episode of ATA Special Edition, Andy Behbakht and Woo S. Kim joins to discuss some of Monteith's most memorable performances, his best songs, the most inspiring aspects about his character and much more as they pay tribute to a young strong actor that was sadly taken from us too early.
Our thoughts goes out to Monteith's family, friends/co-stars, (including real life and TV girlfriend Lea Michelle who portrays Rachel Berry), everyone who works within the&amp;nbsp;Glee&amp;nbsp;production,&amp;nbsp;Ryan Murphy &amp;amp; the creative team for their loss - R.I.P. Cory Monteith; a fantastic actor with a big heart (both on-and-off screen) who will be deeply missed.</description>

                    <description>Listeners of Steel, we present to you a special edition episode of Across the Airwaves that is once again around one of the biggest movies of 2013:&amp;nbsp;Man of Steel! On this special episode, Andy Behbakht returns to the microphone after a &amp;nbsp;few weeks' absence with ATA creator Dan Schmidt and special guest host&amp;nbsp;Chris Beck&amp;nbsp;(@Chris_WeTalk&amp;nbsp;on Twitter)&amp;nbsp;who is a podcast co-host on the comic book podcast, "We Talk Comics" on&amp;nbsp;wetalkpodcasts.com&amp;nbsp;that is sponsored by&amp;nbsp;Comicosity.com&amp;nbsp;(that Andy has recently joined as a&amp;nbsp;comic reviewer) which is a comic book website that gives you comic book reviews, previews, interviews and much more.
In this roundtable discussion, the three men of steel discuss the strength and weaknesses about Zack Snyder's Superman reboot such as the cast, David Goyer's (with Christopher Nolan contributing to the story and serving as a producer on the project), script, the seed that has been planted for the so called DC Cinematic Universe and more. Also included in this episode is the thoughts of Matt Santori-Griffith, senior editor of Comicosity (@FotoCub&amp;nbsp;on Twitter) and Keith Callbeck, podcast co-host of We Talk Comics and a writer of Comicosity (@CubReporterK&amp;nbsp;on Twitter) that were supposed to join the guys but sadly couldn't make it. A warning before you listen to this episode: it is&amp;nbsp;SPOILER FILLED&amp;nbsp;so if you haven't seen the movie yet, we recommend you watch it first and then listen to this discussion.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, with this week containing the 4th of July, the writers of our favorite Summer Shows seemed inspired to light off some fireworks as the penultimate episode of Warehouse 13 introduced Anthony Stewart Head as the Season 4 Big Bad Paracelsus, Falling Skies had the Second Mass finally confront Karen's control over Hal and Continuum had Keira reached her breaking point over the trauma of being sent back in time against her will.&amp;nbsp; Although, that wasn't the only excitement to light up the night sky in our discussions on this week's ATA as our Airwaves Rundown section included Woo being frustrated over the&amp;nbsp; apparent cancellation of The Goodwin Games, Nico and I wondering what's up with the strange use of music at the end of Defiance episodes and Nico reviewing the second episode of CBS's new hit Summer Series Under the Dome. Oh and for those of you looking for the most explosive Summer Series of them all Burn Notice, we didn't have a review this week because it was off due to the Independence Day Holiday but we make up for it with a News with Nico, which caused sparks to fly with some exciting Comic Con Panel Appearance Announcements.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Enhanced Listeners, on this week's podcast we review episodes of our favorite Summer Shows where characters are searching for their immortality or in the case of Warehouse 13's Season 4 Big Bads want to take after the popular Bon Jovi song "I Don't Want to Live Forever". As for our other favorites they fit right in with this theme as Defiance used a murder mystery to breathe life into the series' future, Falling Skies threw Tom and Pope into a fight for survival in the wilderness, a innocent man learns about what it means to have superpowers the hard way from a suit similar to Keira's on Continuum and Burn Notice has Michael learn that being a hardened spy doesn't necessarily keep you alive when hanging out with your old pals from Russia. Also News with Nico delivers some huge TV casting news and we've got more from the section that will never die, the Airwaves Rundown covering the Goodwin Games along with two new hit summer shows CBS's Under the Dome and NBC's Crossing Lines. So with it being the 4th of July, light up the fireworks with this podcast to ooh and ahh over our explosive reviews.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Enhanced Listeners, this week's episode asked the question why can't we all just get along as this week's reviews of our favorite Summer Shows featured individual characters or groups of people that were fighting but really all should just just be getting along. First off, Warehouse 13 took us to a Gated&amp;nbsp; Subdivision where somebody decided to not be so neighborly using an artifact to create some strange happenings followed by Defiance having a viral quarantine drawing a&amp;nbsp; bigger rift between Nolan and his alien daughter Irisa. Then things got heated on Falling Skies between the people of Charleston and what's left of the original United States over the Volm being an ally, Continuum set Liberate's gang war as a backdrop to Keira clashing with Alec over being tempted with riches by Kellogg and the final season of Burn Notice having Sam get frazzled by just how far Michael will go to keep his friends protected from the CIA.&amp;nbsp; Although, don't worry with all the fighting going on between the characters of our favorite shows, it thankfully did not spill into our discussions as Nico, Michael and I all got along this week for the most part so come on and join the fun as a click on the links below will have all sorts of news, laughs, drama and crackpot theories that will blow your mind coming your way.</description>

On this episode, the Dynamic Duo discuss Man of Steel to the fullest as they talk about Superman's No. 1 rule, Krypton, Lois Lane, Jor-El, the crazed General Zod, DC Universe hints/references, the fights, what they loved, and what they did not care for. All this and more is included here!
But the Superman coverage does NOT stop there as the two also review the last week's Smallville Season 11 digital chapter #51 "Argo" - Part 7 (of 9) where they talk about Clark's role in the future, New Krypton, Doomsday, Booster Gold and Skeets, the Legion, and of course Supergirl! Note: this portion of the podcast takes place in the first 20 minutes of the show, so if you are not a Smallville fan, skip those first 20 minutes.
Before you listen to this podcast, please realize that we are huge Superman fans and supporters here on ATA, especially the two hosts of this show, and do not take anything they say about Man of Steel lightly. Also note that there will be SPOILERS in this podcast, so if you have not yet seen the film, listen at your own risk. Man of Steel was a great film, but like any film it has it's flaws. However, that does not stop us from enjoying the film and we actually really enjoyed it.

Yes, that's right folks as my twist on the lyrics of Lovin' Spoonful's hit song implied the heat keeps getting turned up on Across The Airwaves' Summer Schedule with this week's reviews featuring Game of Thrones' Season Finale firing up the slaves of Yunaki to stand behind Daenerys Targaryen, Warehouse 13 featuring an artifact that spews out lava, Defiance putting more fuel on a burning passion between two female characters which may lead to trouble, Burn Notice kicking up its explosive final season, the 2nd Mass surprisingly exchanging gunfire with fellow humans instead of aliens on TNT's Falling Skies and actress Rachel Nichols being just plain hot kicking butt as a cop from the future on SyFy/Showcase's Continuum. So with all that heat, what are you waiting for? Jump in the pool by clicking the links to the episode below because the water is just fine on a Summer full of fun from your favorite hosts here at Across The Airwaves.</description>

                    <description>Look, up in the sky! It's a bird? It's a plane?&amp;nbsp;No, it's Across the Airwaves's very own&amp;nbsp;DC Nation Podcast&amp;nbsp;covering this year's&amp;nbsp;35th annual Superman Celebration! On this week's exciting DC Nation, Dan and Michael first cover the digital chapters of&amp;nbsp;SMALLVILLE SEASON 11&amp;nbsp;that they have not been able to cover over the past few weeks, including the conclusion to "Valkyrie" and the continuation of "Argo"! But after talking about&amp;nbsp;Lana Lang, Metallo, the&amp;nbsp;Legion of Super-Heroes, Doomsday, and&amp;nbsp;New Krypton, the Duo switch to another Super-topic for the remainder of the episode. Every year in&amp;nbsp;Metropolis, Illinois&amp;nbsp;there is a Superman Celebration with celebrity guests, cosplay contests, and a ton of Superman-related fun, this year from June 6th to June 9th. Michael went down from the 6th and left the morning of the 9th giving him a full-on weekend of&amp;nbsp;Superman&amp;nbsp;to hold him over until&amp;nbsp;Man of Steel. Dan and Michael talk about Metropolis, who Michael met (both&amp;nbsp;friends&amp;nbsp;such as Superman Homepage's Steve Younis and&amp;nbsp;celebrities&amp;nbsp;like Smallville's very own Michael Rosenbaum), what he did, how much fun he had, and about the experience in Metropolis over-all. So join Dan &amp;amp; Michael this week for a super-podcast dedicated to the&amp;nbsp;Man of Tomorrow&amp;nbsp;himself!&amp;nbsp;Up, up, and away!
And before we get to the links, I just wanted to give a quick thank you to Michael's dad JD, Steve Younis, the owner of Superman Homepage, his siblings and the owner of the&amp;nbsp; Hardee's in Metropolis, Illinois for showing Michael a good time at the Superman Celebration, you are all friends to this podcast in my book.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; Dan</description>

Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is going to be slightly different as Dan is on Vacation and Nico takes over the podcast for the week and brings in some new faces and some old favorites to help him guest host and review the shows this week.&amp;nbsp; As a special treat, Nico's father, Bill Reifsteck, joins us for a great discussion about the shocking and bloody Red Wedding on this week's Game of Thrones.&amp;nbsp; Then Michael joins Nico to discuss the two-hour Season 3 Premiere of Falling Skies where they discuss the major changes since season 2, the 7 month time jump, they hypothesize about who the mole in the Second Mass might be and come up with some great theories about where the creepy baby story might be going the rest of the season. After that Michael and Nico shift focus to the Season 2 Premiere of Continuum to discuss the more Badass vigilante Kiera, Liber8 becoming involved in politics, and the Gardner character's investigation of Kiera.&amp;nbsp; In this week's Rundown Section, Michael reviews the season finale of Revolution, Woo continues his coverage of The Goodwin Games, and Nico covers Defiance and Warehouse 13.&amp;nbsp; So sit back and enjoy this slightly different version of Across the Airwaves with Nico and special guest hosts</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is going to be one of our biggest and longest episodes ever as we review every show that is going to be on TV this Summer! Psych, just kidding! Okay, most of you long-time listeners probably saw that coming from a mile away as we cover a lot less programming over the summer but believe it or not due to the Memorial Day Holiday, this week's episode, ATA 127 if you're keeping count, only reviews five shows this week, the Season Finale for Psych, which is covered by Nico and myself and a Rundown Section featuring Family Guy, Simpsons, the penultimate episode of Revolution covered by Michael and the introduction of the Goodwin Games reviewed by Woo in an extremely shortened Airwaves Rundown Section.&amp;nbsp;However, for those of you disappointed for feeling shortchanged with this ATA episode, never fear because ATA will return after my vacation from June 4&amp;ndash;11th covering double the Game of Thrones, Warehouse 13, Defiance, Revolution's Season Finale, Burn Notice, the new season of Falling Skies and a new show that were adding to our slate of reviews that you're all going to love Continuum.</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA Fans and welcome to the newest addition to the ATA Podcast Network,&amp;nbsp;phoenix&amp;nbsp;style! On this premiere episode of&amp;nbsp;Tangent Time, Michael J. Petty and Woo S! Kim go in depth into three (which turns into many more...) topics! The Duo discuss the controversy over&amp;nbsp;Quicksilver&amp;nbsp;being in both Marvel Studio's&amp;nbsp;AVENGERS 2&amp;nbsp;and Fox's&amp;nbsp;X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST! Not only that, but they have an in-depth discussion about the&amp;nbsp;X-Men films&amp;nbsp;as well as what it means to be true to a character, at least in film. After that, the two discuss what made them become friends in the first place:&amp;nbsp;SMALLVILLE. But not just the good, they get into the bad and the ugly and talk about&amp;nbsp;what did not work&amp;nbsp;for them while watching the show. Finally, the guys have a conversation about&amp;nbsp;PIXAR, and&amp;nbsp;Disney animation&amp;nbsp;in general, which makes Michael with for another&amp;nbsp;Disney Renaissance! However before they close the episode up, they do talk a bit about&amp;nbsp;the Joker&amp;nbsp;and his current role in comics, animation, and potentially film. All this and more on the first episode of, what time is it, well, It's Tangent Time!</description>

                    <description>Holy month-in-the-making-episode Batman! Hey guys, welcome back to ATA's very own DC Nation! This episode was recorded a few week's back, in fact it was the week after Week 52 was recorded. But, due to personal projects, ATA finale episodes, Longbow Hunters finale episode, living our everyday lives, and being sick, we've been working extra hard this week to get this episode out to you all, because it's a classic! Let me start off by saying that this episode starts out reviewing Smallville Season 11 Digital Issue #45 and Teen Titans Go! Episode 2 meaning they are a few weeks old, but still worth a listen especially for some good insight on Smallville's Valkyrie Arc. However, if you would so choose to do so, skip those sections and head right on over to our main event. Yes folks, you've got it. Finally on the DC Nation Podcast, a commentary on one of the greatest superhero films ever made, the 1966 film -&amp;nbsp;BATMAN: THE MOVIE! That's right, Dan and Michael do a commentary on the Adam West/Burt Ward Batman film, where they discuss/rip-on the 60's Batman, Bruce Wayne and Catwoman, Penguin's acting skills, how great Frank Gorshin is as the Riddler, why Catwoman is Russian, and what is up with Cesar Romero's (the Joker's) mustache! All of this and much much more exists on this week's DC Nation Podcast, Robin. POW!
By the way, with us being a few weeks behind on our Smallville and Teen Titans Go! Reviews plans are in the works for our next episode to catch us up on everything so keep an eye out for DC Nation Podcast Week 54 when Dan returns from Vacation the week of June 11th.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, welcome to Summer! The time of year that we podcasters want to come fast so we can take it slow because a vacation is needed from our favorite shows, for me and Nico. Although, with The Beach Boy lyrics aside, we really have been in need of a break from the avalanche of&amp;nbsp; Television programming we have been reviewing over the past few weeks and our wish came true by us having a shortened schedule made up of a Game of Thrones episode that primarily focused on Tyrion's wedding to Sansa, Warehouse 13 returning to the regular section as it abracadabraed into the world of performing magic, Psych going under the knife within the field of Plastic Surgery and Modern Family delivering a Season Finale, which brought everyone together in a heartwarming fashion with the loss of a family member.
Then Nico continues to keep things hangin' loose with a chilled out version of the Airwaves Rundown section reviewing his favorite episodes from the Family Guy and Simpsons season finales, a standard episode of SyFy's Defiance and the season finale of Grimm. Also Michael stops by to review Revolution while Woo leaves us a highly interesting voicemail about Ted's progression as a character throughout the series of&amp;nbsp; How I Met Your Mother and another about a new show called The Goodwin Games that I'm sure all you HIMYM fans would enjoy.&amp;nbsp; So what are you waiting for? Pull up a lawn chair, grab your shades, fill up a glass of Iced Tea and give this podcast a listen as it will inspire you to act like it's summer even if it's still cold outside where you live.</description>

                    <description>Awww yeah, ATA Listeners you're entering the television storm known as ATA Episode 125! I'm your host a playa named Dan Schmidt, here with my cohost Nico Reifsteck whose keeping it smooth like Psych's Burton Guster. And we are hugging you across the airwaves from the fictional former home of WKRP in Cincinnati with our reviews on Season Finales for the majority of our favorite shows&amp;hellip;
First off, the hug we are providing you is out of condolence as Once upon a Time delivered a finale where two villains we hate lived on to next season much to the dismay of Andy and Castle presented us with a disappointing finale, which left Nico and I flabbergasted because this is the first time, the writers have truly let us down but why did it have to come at the end of such a great season? Then the purpose of our hug changed&amp;nbsp; from being out of condolence to sheer joy as the Supernatural finale had the Winchesters break their constant cycle of sacrificing themselves for each other giving the show progression for the first time in three years. Speaking of character development The Big Bang Theory finale set up a whole bunch of changes for Sheldon, Penny and most importantly Raj in regards to his love life and the Doctor Who finale delivered a shocking revelation about the Doctor's new companion Clara that you need to see the episode to believe.
In addition, even though I skipped some of the shows we normally cover that doesn't mean they weren't a part of the podcast as they didn't have finale's this week but held their own against them as Luke once again delivered the comedy that makes us love Modern Family, Psych gave Gus his own attempt behind the microphone producing hilarious results and Game of Thrones featured a epic showdown with a full grown bear who was willing to maul anyone in it's way.
Although, that's not the end of the smooth sounds this podcast is ready and willing to deliver as the plan was for us to cover standard episodes of Defiance and Warehouse 13, followed by having Woo join us for our review on the finale for How I Met Your Mother where we after eight long years were finally introduced to the mother but I ended up with a kidney stone (ouch!) which I can assure you is anything but smooth. Anyway to make a long story short, Woo was unfortunately reduced to leaving us a voicemail, a result I feel bad about as I know he was very excited about being a part of this section. I was however able to join Nico and Andy for our review on the finale for Arrow which we called the best finale of the 2012&amp;ndash;13 TV Season and gave the show the title of the best new show for this current season. Then Nico brings it all home as he covers the finales for New Girl and Elementary along with much, much more.</description>

                    <description>Hello&amp;nbsp;Arrowheads! Welcome back to the&amp;nbsp;Season Finale&amp;nbsp;episode of both&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters&amp;nbsp;as we close off our podcast (just for a little while) with a dynamic finish. First off, we apologize for the length of this episode being a 3 hour long episode. Sorry, but not sorry. On this episode, Woo and myself (Michael) talk about the&amp;nbsp;Season One finale&amp;nbsp;of Arrow entitled "Sacrifice", which was an incredible episode that really gave us a feel for what this show will be like in the future. We talk about&amp;nbsp;Tommy/Oliver&amp;nbsp;(not the Green/White/Red/Black Power Ranger, unfortunately), we discuss who the true&amp;nbsp;Merlyn&amp;nbsp;is, we talk&amp;nbsp;Detective Lance, Fyers, Oliver's first step to becoming the&amp;nbsp;Green Arrow&amp;nbsp;and what's in store for the Lian Yu flashbacks, the&amp;nbsp;repercussions&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Moria's actions, Thea and Roy,&amp;nbsp;Ra's al Ghul&amp;nbsp;(yes, again), Laurel and Oliver, and where we think the series as a whole is going to go. We also discuss the digital comic entitled "From the Darkness" which chronicles&amp;nbsp;Malcolm's origins (in Nanda Parbat) as the&amp;nbsp;Dark Archer, and we briefly give our thoughts on the epic&amp;nbsp;Supernatural&amp;nbsp;finale which was just as good and aired right after Arrow's. All this and more on this special extended episode of&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, for years man has feared the rise of the machines as in Skynet overrunning the world with Terminators, Cylons trying to extinguish humanity and the Sentinels from X-Men creating a post-apocalyptic future. Well,&amp;nbsp; on this week of television, the machines rising against us almost became a reality as the weaselly Greg used machinery to torture the key to destroying Storybrook out of Regina on Once upon a Time, Castle had a mystery where a robotic military drone murdered an innocent man, Supernatural showed Crowley is a reading machine as he used Chuck's novels to start hunting everyone the Winchesters have ever saved, Psych forced Shawn and Gus to hide a major screwup from a machine of a security guard who was too good for his job, Person of Interest's season finale evolved the machine into an advanced version of the iPhone's and Doctor Who dealt with the return of the villains who originated man's fear of machines the Cybermen!&amp;nbsp; On top of that, the sitcoms even had to face the machines rising against us as Modern Family had Cam take on a punching bag machine,&amp;nbsp; Community pitted Jeff against his doppelg&amp;auml;nger who had a Luke Skywalker style robotic arm and The Big Bang Theory showed us that Sheldon and Amy are not complete soulless machines when it comes to their relationship while throwing in some Howard as Nicholas Cage.
Then to wrap up this well oiled machine of a podcast Nico delivers some big renewal/cancellation news on our favorite CBS, NBC and USA shows we cover here on ATA along with a Airwaves Rundown Section where we review How I Met Your Mother, Revolution, Defiance, Warehouse 13, New Girl, the penultimate episode of Arrow, Elementary and much, much more.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, do you know what Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered, Frodo inheriting The One Ring and Luke Skywalker discovering he is a Jedi&amp;nbsp; all have in common? Well, they are defined as heroic origins, moments where fictional characters start down the path of becoming who they are destined to be, which seemed to be explored quite a bit on this week of television as Game of Thrones had Jamie Lannister reveal the true origins behind his title of Kingslayer, Once upon a Time gave more explanation to the origin of Snow White's hatred towards The Evil Queen, Castle re&amp;ndash;explored the history of Rick and Kate's romance, Supernatural had the Angel Metatron explain the origins behind the Angel/Demon Tablets to the Winchesters, Psych almost had Shawn tell The Chief that the origins of his psychic ability is a little white lie, Person of Interest delivered flashbacks giving the origins of Finch using the machine to help innocent people and Doctor Who had Clara discover the origins of her doppelg&amp;auml;ngers who exist throughout history. Even the sitcoms&amp;nbsp; got in on exploring character's secret origins as Modern Family's Phil Dunphy clashed with the super villain who made him a realtor Gil Thorpe, The Big Bang Theory had Sheldon meet the children's television star that inspired him to be a scientist and Community had Abed cleverly line up all of its main characters histories to tell the Study Group's heroic origins of how they got to Greendale in the format of the movie Unbreakable, which also inspired this week's closing podcast music.
However, that's not all we've got on this podcast fit for a hero's origin as Andy joins Nico to discuss the heart racing Season Finale of The Following, Woo joins Andy to discuss Glee, Michael stops by to talk Revolution and Nico brings it home with me jumping in briefly to discuss the Midseason Premiere of Warehouse 13, Defiance, New Girl, Arrow, How I Met Your Mother and much more. Also the great Woo S. Kim shares with you guys some voicemails on How I Met Your Mother and the Bones Season Finale where the menacing serial killer Christopher Pelant returned.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I don't know if you all checked it out but this week's Game of Thrones had Daenerys Targaryen become the ultimate representation of girl power as she said I am woman, hear my dragons roar as she kick started a slave uprising by having her winged pets flame broil an abusive tyrant. In result of this, the writers of our other favorite shows must have been inspired as they aired episodes with their female characters showing some kick butt dominance.&amp;nbsp; Yep, that's right folks. ATA Episode 122 is all about girl power discussing Belle's jarring personality transformation on Once upon a Time, Beckett using a Millionaire Inventor to play hard to get with Castle, Felicia Day's return to Supernatural where she becomes a full-fledged hunter, Community's Britta untangling a Freaky Friday situation to deal with a breakup, Juliet taking down a stalker Karate Kid Cobra Kai style on Psych, The Big Bang Theory's Amy helping Sheldon find closure to the cancellation of SyFy's Alphas and Person of Interest having Carter save Fusco's butt big time. However, that's not all we got from the liberated female characters of television as I present a whopping crackpot theory from this week's Journey to the Center of the TARDIS Doctor Who episode regarding Clara being the Doctor's ultimate companion or in other words a representation of all 50 years of Doctor Who, who has shown up just in time for the 50th Anniversary Special in the Fall.
Also with this week of television, I'm sure you can find plenty of other moments where women have reigned supreme in another edition of our Airwaves&amp;nbsp; Rundown Section where Andy helps Nico review The Following, Michael covers Revolution, I jump into Nico's review on Defiance and the great Woo Kim gives Andy a helping hand with discussing Glee. On top of that, Nico reviews The Americans, Elementary and much more. So guys who like geeking&amp;nbsp; out over their TV Crushes and girls who like cheering on their favorite fictional gal pals, what are you waiting for?! Give this girl powered podcast a listen because this one's for you!</description>

                    <description>Hello Super-fans, welcome back (or if this is your first time, welcome) to Across the Airwaves's very own DC Nation Podcast! On this week's episode, hosts Dan Schmidt and Michael J. Petty are joined by their good-friend and fellow ATA podcaster, Woo S! Kim! The reason Woo joined this Dynamic Duo to form a&amp;nbsp;Terrific&amp;nbsp;Trio was because of this week's main event podcast, two weeks in the making! The official ATA coverage of the third and final MAN OF STEEL theatrical trailer! Going deep into the trailer, the team discuss what they enjoyed including the fact that Superman actually throws a punch, General Zod's "I will find him!", Amy Adams' Lois Lane, Russel Crowe's Jor-El, Hans Zimmer's score, and the comic book influences including Superman: Birthright, Superman: Secret Origin, Superman: Earth One, All-Star Superman, Superman: Red Son, and John Byrne's The Man of Steel origin! And of course, to compliment our Superman-themed episode of DC Nation, we cover Smallville Season 11's "Argo" - Part 2, where we talk about Skeets, CorTessa, Brainiac 5's powers, Lightning Lad, and of course more Clark Kent as we see him in the future of the 31st century! All of this and much more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!

                    <description>Hey gang, like what's going on? On this groovy episode of ATA's DC Nation Podcast, Dan and Michael cover, like, one of the last good shows to air on Cartoon Network (after Young&amp;nbsp;Justice&amp;nbsp; Green Lantern: The Animated Series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and ThunderCats)&amp;nbsp;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated! Like yeah man, Dan, Nico, and Michael have all covered the series on ATA before, but now that it has completed it's run (and because DC Comics does produce a Scooby-Doo comic series), the Dynamic Duo decided to cover the series as a whole and try and get fans of Scooby-Doo, supernatural plots, and teenage dramas to like check out the series. This podcast talks about the Fred &amp;amp; Daphne relationship, Scooby's role in the series, Shaggy &amp;amp; Velma, the supernatural mysteries and over-arching plot-lines that make up the series, and the amazing three-part series finale that could easily be the "greatest Scooby-Doo story ever told". But fret not fans of Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville Season 11 as the Duo does indeed cover "Argo" - Part 1, like, in great detail (yes, we're a little behind on those chapters, but like please bare with us)! All this and, like, more man on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, have you ever envisioned White Walkers invading from The North, seen evidence proving the existence of Bigfoot, believed you were traveling between parallel realities or maybe thought you had a ghost haunting your Victorian Estate? Well, if the answer to any of these questions is yes, you might think your entering The Twilight Zone but there's really only one place where these sweet dreams are made on TV with this week's reviews on Game of Thrones, Castle, Psych, Community and Doctor Who. Although, the trip through the seven seas of a television dreamworld doesn't stop there as our Airwaves&amp;nbsp; Rundown Section welcomes you to the new age where humans and aliens must coexist by reviewing SyFy's revolutionary new show Defiance, the first TV series to ever tie in with a videogame of the same name. Then we finish off this week's dream themed podcast with reviews on a filler episode of How I Met Your Mother, The Following, The Americans, Glee, Da Vinci's Demons, Grimm and much more.</description>

                    <description>Hello all of you who have been anxiously awaiting this latest episode of ATA's DC Nation Podcast! We're sorry that it took so long, but both Dan and myself had a lot going on and we weren't able to work on this episode as much. Anyway, on this week's episode, Dan and I cover one of the greatest Batman epics of this generation, if not of all-time: BATMAN: DEATH OF THE FAMILY. We go through this&amp;nbsp;story&amp;nbsp;play-by-play where we talk about the tie-in's, including Batgirl, Catwoman, Suicide Squad, Nightwing, Teen Titans, Red Hood &amp;amp; the Outlaws, Detective Comics, and of course Scott Snyder's Batman! We also discuss the Joker and his possible New 52 origin, as well as how we feel about Batman: Zero Year! And, on the note of DoTF, we also go into in depth discussion about Grant Morrison's ROBIN R.I.P. story (in Batman Incorporated #8) and go deep into our feelings about Grant Morrison's Batman, Batman Inc., and Action Comics. And don't worry fans of Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville Season 11, because we also cover "Valkyrie" - Part 1 where we talk about Lois Lane and Lana Lang! All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's time for everybody to Wang Chung tonight as the reviews of our favorite TV shows for the week took us back to the 80's with this edition of the Across The Airwaves Podcast. Well actually we first take a pit stop in a parallel fantasy style version of what we would classify Medieval Times&amp;nbsp; as we discuss Game of Thrones. Then we Wang Chung to the synthesizing sounds of the 80s as Modern Family has the Dunphys woo a potential buyer of their flipped house with the hit Queen song Another One Bites the Dust, Community's use of puppets brought me back to watching Sesame Street as a kid in the 80s, Go On told a joke that probably referenced George's days as a cop in the 80s and Psych literally had their characters Wang Chung tonight as Lassie's wedding&amp;nbsp; was a perfect celebration of his character that ended in one of the most shocking moments of the series. Heck, we even ran into the Doctor and Clara with our travels back to the 80s as they had just come off a Doctor Who adventure that was a combination of two classic 80s films, Aliens and The Hunt for Red October. They also added a little bit of Duran Duran's Hungry like the Wolf to our Wang Chung rocking by introducing us to their new friend the Professor from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II Secret of the Ooze.
However that wasn't the end to our Wang Chunging as our Airwaves Rundown Section had Michael, Andy and Woo bust out the freestyle dance moves on their respective reviews of Revolution, The Following and a highly controversial school shooting episode of Glee. Then Nico puts his final moves on the dance party with his reviews on New Girl, The Americans, the new Starz original series Da Vinci's Demons and much more.</description>

                    <description>Hey gang! Welcome back to this long awaited episode of ATA's&amp;nbsp;DC Nation as we return from a long hiatus due to our main animated content being cancelled by Cartoon Network (Young Justice and Green Lantern: The Animated Series). Sad day. But what isn't sad is our final coverage of the conclusion of the Bryan Q. Miller written&amp;nbsp;Smallville Season 11 episode "Haunted" as we wrap up the final three digital issues (#38-40) aka the 12th print issue of the series! After that sad talk about Bart's demise, the return of Tess Mercer and Clark Kent, and the farewell (at least for now) of Chloe and Oliver, we move right along into covering one of the best parts of the New 52... The Geoff Johns written Aquaman/Justice League crossover event that rocked the New 52 universe: Throne of Atlantis! We talk about Aquaman, Cyborg, the Superman/Wonder Woman romance, the Batman/Aquaman duo, Vulko, the&amp;nbsp;Prologue&amp;nbsp; the&amp;nbsp;Epilogue&amp;nbsp;and what is in store for both the Justice League and Aquaman himself! All this and much more on this week's edition of the DC Nation Podcast!!!</description>

                    <description>Good day Lords and Ladies from the House of ATA Listeners! I present you a legendary sized podcast titled "Rear Window to a Game of Thrones" as Castle's&amp;nbsp; Rear Window themed 100th Episode and the addition of Game of Thrones to our regular slate of reviews headline our discussions about Luke and Phil trying to invent the first self flipping pancake on Modern Family, Psych presenting us with a Two and a Half Men scenario that led to a brief breakup for Shawn and Gus,&amp;nbsp; Supernatural taking Sam on the highway to hell literally and the guys having a somewhat socially offensive battle for tenure on The Big Bang Theory. In addition, Community has Abed tangle with the classic TV Trope of having two dates to the same dance, Ryan shows off his mad dance skills in a mascot uniform on this week's Go On and we give our two cents on a Doctor Who episode that did a good job of getting us to know his new companion Clara but fell short on the awesomeness scale compared to the other episodes we've had this season.
Although, that's not all you're going to get from this podcast as we're not going to keep you hanging without another Airwaves Rundown Section where Michael takes over our weekly Revolution segment to lead off thoughts on the Season Finales for The Walking Dead and Justified as well as reviews on regular episodes of New Girl, The Following, Arrow, Glee and much more.</description>

                    <description>Hey guys, welcome back to this week's very exciting and action-packed episode of Across the Airwaves'&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast! On this episode, Woo &amp;amp; I talk about the ATA-favorite&amp;nbsp;Bryan Q. Miller&amp;nbsp;co-written episode (with Lindsey Allen) of&amp;nbsp;Arrow: "Unfinished Business"! We talk about&amp;nbsp;the Count's new status at&amp;nbsp;Starkham, Tommy's&amp;nbsp;dark decent, Oliver's&amp;nbsp;training on Lian Yu, and Diggle's&amp;nbsp;revenge-against-Deadshot&amp;nbsp;story-line. As you will be able to tell by our discussion, we really enjoyed this episode, but the episode is not all we talk about as we discuss this week's digital comic entitled "Lapse", which chronicles the&amp;nbsp;Tommy/Laurel&amp;nbsp;relationship in graphic detail! And for those fans of Jeff Lemire's&amp;nbsp;New 52 Green Arrow&amp;nbsp;comic series (as I am), I review the 3rd issue in his new run (Green Arrow #19), "The Kill Machine, Part 3". All this&amp;nbsp;Emerald Archer-y goodness in this week's episode of Longbow Hunters!!!</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is entitled "Dan and Nico Don't Have a CLUE" in honor of Psych's 100th Episode having a Clue as in the motion picture&amp;nbsp; theme but this title ended up going beyond Psych as Nico and I had a few strong disagreements on a Castle episode that puts its focus on Ryan as well as our thoughts on the success of Psych as a whole. Although in the end, we were pretty much left unsure on who was right with their arguments as all of you&amp;nbsp; Television Watchers out there could've seen it either way so that's what left us without a clue.&amp;nbsp; The good news is Andy was able to give some direction with our&amp;nbsp; cluelessness as he joined me to review an episode of Once upon a Time where we vented our frustrations on the reset applied to Pinocchio's character.&amp;nbsp; Then Nico and I were able to get back on the same page as we reviewed a Friends reunion on Go On, Modern Family taking Handball to the extreme, Supernatural&amp;nbsp; going X-Men style with the wild world of Hunters and a Doctor Who episode that will now make us think twice when logging on to a Wi-Fi network.
However, that's not all we go over this week as the Airwaves Rundown Section has us looking at the midseason premiere of Revolution, which seems to be a better show than when we&amp;nbsp; left it but there's still much better stuff out there as we indicate by providing our thoughts on How I Met Your Mother, Bones, New Girl, Justified, The Following, Walking Dead, Glee, The Americans and much more.</description>

Also,&amp;nbsp;Roy Harper. We also cover the 25th digital comic book chapter entitled "The Pieces Missing" as we try and figure out why&amp;nbsp;Diggle&amp;nbsp;wants to know about&amp;nbsp;Lian Yu.

                    <description>Salutations ATA Listeners! It's that time of year again where our podcast experiences its own version of March Madness that doesn't even involve Basketball. Actually, it does kind of involve basketball as the NCAA Tournament (which I enjoy watching) acts as one of the reasons why the Spring schedule for our favorite TV Shows is a giant hodgepodge that makes filling out a bracket of 64 teams look easy&amp;nbsp; as we seem to get a different set of shows on hiatus or premiering every other week. In other words, if it wasn't for people like Nico and Andy helping me keep it all straight, I'd be pulling my hair out because it's getting crazy up in here.
As for what's on tap to review this week, Once upon a Time reveals a new real world villain, Castle gives its own fun homage to horror movies like The Ring, Go On continues to have more fun with NFL star Terrel Owens, Jeffrey Tambor shines in a great guest spot on Psych, Supernatural pushes the tablet story arc forward in big ways and Abed starts his own fraternity on Community. Then we round this podcast out as always with our Airwaves Rundown section featuring our thoughts on The Walking Dead, How I Met Your Mother, Bones, The Following, New Girl, Justified, Arrow, The Americans, Glee and much, much more including a voicemail from Longbow Hunters/ATA Retro Reviews very own Woo Kim.</description>

                    <description>Greetings loyal Fanterns, Young Justice fans, and DC Nationites! On March 16th, 2013, we all experienced a heavy loss. It wasn't just Aya or Wally West's "deaths" that were bad, it was the fact that DC Nation will never be the same again as Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Young Justice: Invasion are now gone from Cartoon Network. But, as you will hear in this recording of that day's Live Show Event hosted by DC Nation Podcast hosts Dan Schmidt &amp;amp; Michael J. Petty, with guest host Andy Behbakht, it may not be the end of these shows forever.
However, in this ATA Live Show, the Trio discussed the Green Lantern: The Animated Series series finale "Dark Matter" &amp;amp; the Young Justice: Invasion series finale "Endgame". They talk about Aya's "death" and how she could easily be alive, the epic space battle between the Green Lantern Corps and the Manhunters, shipping Razaya, SuperMartian, and Spitfire, Wally West's "cease", Aqualad being back as team leader, Artemis's change to Tigress, and Dick Grayson's send-off. But that's not all, the three each give their own experiences watching both series' and explain how they got into each show.
But that's not all folks, because for the second half of the show, Dan, Michael, and Andy play the voicemails that us here at the DC Nation Podcast have&amp;nbsp;received&amp;nbsp;over the past week from a bunch of fans (shout out to Jason A. and Rod) and cast/crew of Young Justice and/or Green Lantern alike! We hear from Phil Morris (Saint Walker on GLTAS), Josh Keaton (Hal Jordan on GLTAS, Black Spider on YJ), our friend Jeremy Adams (writer on GLTAS), Christopher Jones (artist on the YJ comic), and Jason Spisak (Kid Flash on YJ, Razer on GLTAS)! On top of that, superhero animation experts from all over the internet including, Eric from Superhero Shows, Steve Younis from the&amp;nbsp;Superman Homepage, and James Harvey from World's Finest Online&amp;nbsp;send Young Justice &amp;amp; Green Lantern their farewells too!
We would also like to give a big thank you to everyone who has been a part of DC Nation, Young Justice, and Green Lantern: The Animated series in some fashion from those who write or come up with the story to the actors &amp;amp; editors to the artists and animators.

                    <description>Hey&amp;nbsp;ATA Listeners, have you ever felt like you spend your week around a campfire with your friends Emma Swan, Shawn Spencer, Jeff Winger, Dr. Sheldon Cooper and John Reese where they share stories about everything from hunting down Bigfoot to the retelling the plot of The Goonies? Do you understand what I'm talking about, do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming or is this campfire that's burning an eternal flame? Well, if you answered yes that means you are a hard-core television watcher fired up for our podcast reviews on your favorite shows airing this week including an episode ofOnce upon a Time&amp;nbsp;where Snow White goes to the dark side, a&amp;nbsp;Psych&amp;nbsp;hunt for Bigfoot parodying The Blair Witch Project, Jeff trying to prove Chang's amnesia is a fake on&amp;nbsp;Community, a&amp;nbsp;Big Bang Theory&amp;nbsp;that did a good job of getting a little emotional and&amp;nbsp;Person of Interest&amp;nbsp;bringing itself back to the Casinos where International Men of Mystery like John Reese originated.
Also as always we have another edition of&amp;nbsp;News with Nico&amp;nbsp;featuring a story about the upcoming fan budgeted&amp;nbsp;Veronica Mars movie&amp;nbsp;as well as ourAirwaves Rundown Section&amp;nbsp;featuring reviews on&amp;nbsp;Walking Dead,&amp;nbsp;The Following,&amp;nbsp;Justified,&amp;nbsp;The Americans,&amp;nbsp;Glee, the return of&amp;nbsp;Grimm&amp;nbsp;and much, much more.</description>

                    <description>While some of the shows that Across the Airwaves cover here are on a little break: the two comic book nerds Andy Behbakht and Michael J Petty join forces for a special edition of Across the Airwaves dedicated to reviewing some of their favorite comic books. They review and discuss books such as Geoff Johns&amp;nbsp;Justice League, Justice League of America,&amp;nbsp;Jeff Lemire&amp;rsquo;s current run on the&amp;nbsp;Green Arrow&amp;nbsp;book, as well as other big books in DC Comics current &amp;ldquo;New 52&amp;rdquo;. There is also a big discussion regarding what is up with Marvel Comic&amp;rsquo;s favorite web-crawler Spider-Man.
The second portion of the episode is dedicated for discussions of the several upcoming movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while also discussing Zack Snyder&amp;rsquo;s upcoming&amp;nbsp;Man of Steel&amp;nbsp;movie. The two nerdy hosts also talk and discuss what is currently going on &amp;ndash; as well as not going on - with Warner Bros. DC Cinematic Universe with all the rumors regarding a future&amp;nbsp;Justice League&amp;nbsp;movie keeping flying in almost every week. Suggestions to how the approach on the DCCU could be done as well as casting ideas is also brought because what would a comic book/comic book movie episode be without some dream casting discussion?</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast, here on Across the Airwaves, and it looks like we've got a special penultimate episode for you guys tonight! First on this week's agenda, we try and help get through some Manhunters when we cover the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode "Ranx"! We discuss the possibilities of seeing more than one Earth Green Lantern in the series finale, Razer's realization of what the team may have to do to defeat Aya, and give our other thoughts and predictions about the final episode. Then, after covering the Plastic Man and Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld shorts, we move onto covering the Young Justice: Invasion episode "Summit" where we freak out over Dan's crackpot theory for the series finale, cry at the "deaths" of Aqualad and Artemis, rejoice at the return of Wally West, and plead with DC Comics to give Young Justice (and Green Lantern as well) a "Smallville Season 11-like" comic series that will continue the series for us fans. We quickly end our episode (as the discussions got a little long) with covering Smallville Season 11's &amp;nbsp;"Effigy, Part 4" where we witness the birth of Miss Martian into the Smallville Universe, which opens the way for Bryan Q. Miller to bring in a Smallville-version of the Young Justice Team! Also, Batman and Martian Manhunter. All this and more on this week's DC Nation Podcast!
And don't forget to tune in tomorrow at 2/1c PM on our Ustream account to watch our DC Nation Live Show Event covering the series finales of Young Justice &amp;amp; Green Lantern, as well as giving our final goodbyes to the shows and sharing our experiences with the shows in the past.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's the Big Bopper speaking doing just what I like, podcast reviews on a great week of television, which started off Andy and I reviewing a Once upon a Time episode where Snow White in (everybody sing...)&amp;nbsp;
Chantilly Lace had evil on her face and Go On's cast was placing bets down&amp;nbsp;
As Big Bang's Cinderella had a giggle and a yell that made the world go round
There ain't nothing in Psych's world
Like Shawn giving Lassie a whirl to make things funny and Community's spoof on Shawshank not worth the money
Set a Person of Interest killer loose who tried to play us like a goose
Because yeah oh baby that's what we TV watchers like! 
However, that's not all there is to like about ATA Episode 115 as we've also got a News with Nico section featuring a big rumor about the future for the DC&amp;nbsp; Comics Cinematic Universe if Man of Steel is a success this summer and another addition of the Airwaves Rundown Section containing our thoughts on The Simpsons, The Walking Dead, History Channel's new hit show Vikings, The Following with Andy, Bones, Justified, the season finale of White Collar, The Americans, Glee, and the long awaited return of Grimm.
All in all this is another great episode so join us for some television reviewing fun!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hello fellow DC Nationites, Fanterns, and Young Justice junkies and welcome back (or for some of you, welcome) to Across the Airwaves' DC Nation Podcast, and boy do we have a special one for you guys today! On this episode of DC Nation, hosts Dan &amp;amp; Michael are guested by none other than&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Green Lantern: The Animated Series writer of "Blue Hope" and "Scarred": Jeremy Adams! So, for the first hour and 15 minutes, the&amp;nbsp;Terrific&amp;nbsp;Trio discuss GL:TAS, specifically Jeremy's episodes of the series, and get a "behind-the-scenes" feel of how the show is created. But if you thought that talking Green Lantern for over an hour wasn't enough, Dan &amp;amp; Michael also cover the DC Nation Short - Amethyst: Level 6! But that's not all as the Dynamic Duo continues to cover the Young Justice: Invasion episode "Intervention", where the two get into some talk about Zatanna's use this season, Blue Beetle, and how Batgirl works on the Young Justice Team. After that there is also some talk about the Smallville Season 11 issue #36, "Effigy, Chapter 3", where the boys have an interesting theory on just who the White Martian that Batman and J'onn J'onzz are hunting may be. All this and much more on this week's DC Nation Podcast, so be prepared!
Michael's review of this week's Smallville Season 11 issue can be found on the Superman Homepage: HERE.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, welcome to Across the Airwaves, on this week&amp;rsquo;s podcast we discuss our favorite shows this week and five interesting News with Nico items.
In our discussion this week, Castle saw the introduction of James Brolin as Castle's father in a great second half to the Season 5 two-part episode.&amp;nbsp; Go On saw a great bit with Mr K as Mary Poppins that both Dan and Nico thought worthy of their favorite comedic moment.&amp;nbsp; The Modern Family discussion mostly focused on the great Phil and Luke story arc that revolved around Luke's dating.&amp;nbsp; Dan and Nico both agreed that Supernatural was a pretty great, despite being slower, more plot driven, and a lot less action oriented than the past few episodes.&amp;nbsp; Psych saw a discussion of our favorite comedic moments in the middle of a full review because both Dan and Nico loved this season premiere.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the Community discussion saw a disagreement between Dan and Nico on the quality of this episode and Nico's argument that showing the Study Group as villains was consistent with theme of this episode, while Dan argued that it was inconsistent with the theme of the overall show.&amp;nbsp;

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's time to Bow Before Thoraxis on this week's podcast as we discuss our favorite shows this week and three interesting News with Nico items.&amp;nbsp;
In our discussion this week, Once Upon a Time saw the dual reunion of father and son as Henry met his father for the first time and Henry's father was reunited with his father, Rumplestiltskin.&amp;nbsp; Castle was action packed in the first part of the Season 5 Two Part Episode that saw the kidnapping of Alexis and Dan and Nico discuss what this could mean going forward both in the story and tone of the show.&amp;nbsp; Go On tried to Go Deep with meditation and Terrel Owens, but ended up getting most of its comedy from boner cream jokes... to great effect.&amp;nbsp; Modern Family made Dan laugh at an unfortunate haircut, while Nico enjoyed another Luke moment.&amp;nbsp; Supernatural turned out to be the most contentious show of the week as one of our fearless leaders felt the show was didn't have a whole going on, while the other really enjoyed it. A lively discussion ensued. &amp;nbsp;But it was all buddy cop from then on as they both agreed on the same two scenes being the best of the week on Community as the gang attended a Inspector Spacetime Convention and all Bowed before Jeff who was impersonating the super villain Thoraxis.&amp;nbsp; The Big Bang Theory discussion focused on Fun with Flags and the excellent Raj budding &amp;nbsp;relationship story arc.&amp;nbsp; Both Dan and Nico agreed that Kate Miccuci was an excellent choice. Finally, Dan and Nico loved the introduction of Agent Shaw and the praised the use of a Doctor Who style story structure that focused on Agent Shaw and put the Person of Interest Team in the background and Dan calls out all the Person of Interest fans who were critical of the change from the formula.
As usual, we rounded out the episode with an Airwaves Rundown section that included Family Guy, Simpsons, and excellent episode of The Walking Dead from Sunday Night.&amp;nbsp; Monday night included a How I Met Your Mother, Andy joined Nico for The Following section, and both Dan and Nico agreed for once on the Bones discussions.&amp;nbsp; Tuesday night saw another great New Girl episode, Nico showing more love for Justified, Dan and Nico agreeing that White Collar was a very weak effort this week and Nico reviews the premiere of the new CW show Cult that he found quite captivating, but does not plan to review the show from week to week unless other people demand it. Wednesday saw another new Arrow discussion facilitated by Andy that discussed the effectiveness of the Roy Harper introduction and the Dodger character, which left Andy as the odd man out really enjoying Roy Harper's introduction.&amp;nbsp; Nico also reviewed the Americans, Elementary, and for probably the last time, Zero Hour.</description>

                    <description>Greetings, DC Nationites! On this week's podcast our reviews proved "Love Is a Battlefield" as the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode of the same name featured Dark Aya trying to eradicate the Champions of Love known as the Star Sapphires, Young Justice Invasion had Miss Martian face several&amp;nbsp;"Complications" as she tried to escape captivity to be reunited with her lost love Superboy and Smallville Season 11 #34 Haunted Chapter 8 stirred up quite a bit of controversy as it was revealed that in the Earth 2 timeline Chloe and Oliver had an affair while he was engaged to Lois. Even Michael and I got out on the battlefield as we form an argument against Cartoon Network about canceling the current DC Nation shows we love now for something goofy like Teen Titans Go! while explaining what they should do instead. Also to top that off we tried to review the short Amethyst - Level Five: Battle in the Stormy Peaks but it ended up evolving into a discussion on our concerns/fears on the future of Superhero Animation as a whole that was quite informative. Yeah, I know it sounds like we skewed off quite a bit in this podcast but ultimately what it boils down to is some of the best discussions we've had so give this show a listen as you are in for a real treat.</description>

                    <description>War, what is it good for?! Absolutely nothing! Actually for you DC Nationers war was good for something as it set up great installments of our favorite DC&amp;nbsp; related TV Shows and Comic Books for us to review here on Week 43 of the DC Nation Podcast. First off, the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode "Babel", Dark Aya's war against the Universe began as she sent the Interceptor crash landing on an strange Alien planet where Hal, Razor and Kilowog had to make do without their power rings. Then in the Young Justice Invasion episode "War", the team goes to War literally as they battle to stop Mongul from destroying Earth with his Death Star, I mean WarWorld. Finally, the week was rounded out with Clark and Bart's war against the Dark Flash directing them to the home of a surprisingly gruff and grumpy Jay Garrick in Smallville Season 11 #33: Haunted Chapter 7.
Along with some great discussions on our favorite heroes going to war, we have a special edition of Michael's DC Headlines News Section where we talk about a big announcement made by Geoff Johns regarding writing the current Green Lantern Comic Books and reveal the title as well as artwork for the next Smallville Season 11 story arc entitled "Argo" where Clark is going to be sent to the future! So get excited or Argo flip yourself.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, with this week's podcast reviewing episodes of our favorite shows during the week of Valentine's Day. We decided to celebrate television's most popular couples being happy together as Once upon a Time gave Snow White and Prince Charming a renewed sense of adventure, Castle and Beckett kept each other in suspense over their Valentine's Day gifts, Claire and Phil's aspirations to do some sexual role-playing on Modern Family was ruined with a trip to the hospital and The Big Bang Theory featured the sweetest Valentine's Day moment of the week as Sheldon made Amy his emergency contact. However, the theme of being happy together on Valentine's Day dinner didn't just apply to romantic love, it applied to other types as well with brotherly love being exhibited by the Winchesters as Sam made a hard decision to end the cycle of the brothers sacrificing themselves for each other. We also got buddy love as Reese got into a no holds bar death match with a Government assassin to protect Finch's identity and some love between holidays as Community had a Halloween episode during the week of Valentine's Day creating a new event known as Valoween.
By the way,&amp;nbsp; I can't end the introduction to our Valentine's Day episode without mentioning Andy being happy together with both Nico and then later Woo in our discussions on The Following and this week's Glee. On top of that, we show our love for Arrow with a brand-new formatted section that isn't a repeat of our voicemails on Longbow Hunters and finally, we round out our episode discussing television happy together with Rundown Sections on How I Met Your Mother, Bones, Justified, ABC's new series Zero Hour and a whole lot more.</description>

Miller writing an episode of Arrow, Arrow getting a Season 2 pickup, and Harrison Ford (along with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher) being in Star Wars Episode VII.

We talk about Oliver getting shot by his mom, Felicity's time on Team Arrow, Batman/Green Arrow parallels, Oliver's training on the island with Slade, how the Undertaking could be a part of the Island, and Yao Fei's&amp;nbsp;mysterious&amp;nbsp;daughter! We also cover the digital comic book chapter of the week, this week's being "Wintergreen", which explains the origins of how/why Slade and Wintergreen got on the Island in the first place. And of course, as always, after the music we talk about next week's episode "Dodger" in the spoilers section! All this and more on this week's Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>(Upbeat Singing) It's Dan and Nico in the morning! Podcast style!&amp;nbsp; That's right loyal listeners, we are broadcasting to you from our happy place here at Across the Airwaves a spinoff version of Troy and Abed's popular imaginary morning show to celebrate the return of the happy place within a happy place known as our review section on Community, a show that has been on hiatus for far too long. Personally, I felt the Season Premiere lived up to the hype as Community didn't seem to miss a beat with transitioning to new Showrunners but Nico tended to feel otherwise. The good news is that despite our differences we give you solid coverage on everything to be excited about when it comes to this episode along with the upcoming season including the Study Group facing the challenge of being Seniors, little red balls and Greendale Babies?!
In addition to Community, we review new episodes of Castle, Modern Family, Supernatural, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest and The Following while providing you with a Airwaves Rundown Section revealing our favorite commercials from Super Bowl XLVII. Then we wrap the Rundown up with condensed reviews on Bones, HIMYM, White Collar, Glee, Justified and much more.</description>

Highlights such as Nico gushing his nerd love for Felicia Day, Dan and Andy ranting about the status of a certain webcrawler in Marvel and much more!&amp;nbsp;The episode also discusses about Across the Airwaves' very own&amp;nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D.&amp;nbsp;podcast that is in pre-production as we wait for the official pickup at the ABC Upfront that will take place in May.

On this exciting episode, Woo and myself cover Episode 13 of&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;entitled&amp;nbsp;"Betrayal"! We discuss&amp;nbsp;Detective Lance&amp;nbsp;(redemption or depression?),&amp;nbsp;David Anders&amp;nbsp;guest appearance as an Arrow original villain&amp;nbsp;Cyrus Vanch&amp;nbsp;(who we hope returns soon), Ollie's&amp;nbsp;24 arrows,&amp;nbsp;the Undertaking,&amp;nbsp;Slade Wilson&amp;nbsp;aka&amp;nbsp;Deathstroke&amp;nbsp;(2?), and that&amp;nbsp;incredible end scene! We also talk about this weeks Arrow&amp;nbsp;digital comic book&amp;nbsp;"Keep 'Em Coming", where we get some interesting backstory on Lance that actually makes me&amp;nbsp;feel sorry&amp;nbsp;for the guy.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's podcast we review episodes where our favorite television characters experienced a blast from the past as Go On featured Ryan&amp;nbsp; being haunted by the ghost of his wife, the Winchesters met their grandfather on Supernatural, Sheldon tangled with his old nemesis Kripke during The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest had Reese contend with his ex-partner from the CIA to avoid getting caught in his own personal bomb blast! At the same time,&amp;nbsp; let's not forget Ryan Hardy having to take on the friends of a serial killer he apprehended years ago on The Following, which has now become a part of our standard reviews beginning with this podcast. Then we've got a supersized edition of our Airwaves Rundown Section where Nico and I share our top 5 favorite commercials from Super Bowl XLVII while introducing a new segment dedicated to reviewing FX's new series The Americans. In addition, we discuss HIMYM, Arrow, Glee, Justified and much more.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites! Welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast! This weeks episode was sad. As we cover the very depressing Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode "Loss", we &amp;nbsp;do get a little emotional because of some intense Aya and Razer scenes... But the emotions don't stop, as Dan and Michael freak-out in both joy and horror as they cover Young Justice Invasion's episode "The Fix", which features M'gann going deep into her former teammate's, Aqualad, head (with Artemis) to bring him back to the land of the living. But with&amp;nbsp;villains&amp;nbsp;like the Anti-Monitor, Red Lantern Zox, Black Manta, and Deathstroke, who needs friends? Well in Smallville Season 11's "Haunted, Chapter 6" we find out that Bart Allen aka Impulse needs a friend in Clark Kent aka Superman as the Black Flash is gaining on him fast. Who else is there to turn but to the first speedster to call himself "The Flash"? But don't worry, some great DC Nation Shorts are included in here as well, including DC Nation's Farm League AND (back by popular demand) Batman of Shanghai in the super-exciting "Bat-Man". All this and more on this week's DC Nation!!!
And don't forget Fanterns and Young Justice-fans, that on the finale day of DC Nation's Green Lantern &amp;amp; Young Justice (March 16th, 2013), our podcast will be doing a DC Nation Live Show Event to talk about the past year of DC Nation, thank the creators, actors, writers, and producers of both GLTAS &amp;amp; YJ, and of course get fan-reactions to the finale, as you are all welcomed to call in during the event and be part of it yourselves! Join us then, more details will be made available as it gets closer to the finale date and we find out more ourselves.</description>

                    <description>Holy Riddler-Joker-Scarecrow wannabe, Woo!&amp;nbsp;Welcome to our latest episode of&amp;nbsp;Across the Airwaves's Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast! On this weeks episode, ATA Creator,&amp;nbsp;Dan Schmidt, joins Woo and I for a special episode where we talk about the&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;episode "Vertigo". We talk about how this episode is really a game-changer on a bunch of levels, including the Flashbacks, Arrow's Rouges Gallery (mainly&amp;nbsp;The Count)&amp;nbsp;Thea, Laurel,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Oliver's roles on the series, Felicity becoming part of&amp;nbsp;Team Arrow, and what may happen with Moria or Walter. We also Dig deep into our predictions on where Detective Lance,&amp;nbsp;Tommy, and Moria's characters will go throughout this season (and series) and how we see them either&amp;nbsp;dying&amp;nbsp;or embracing their&amp;nbsp;dark destinies. Also, there's a point in the episode where Woo, Dan, and I get a little heated when talking about Arrow and&amp;nbsp;Man of Steel&amp;nbsp;being the bridge for the upcoming&amp;nbsp;Justice League&amp;nbsp;movie, and the (hopefully) upcoming&amp;nbsp;DC Cinematic Universe. We also cover the latest digital comic book chapter "Two Minute Warning" and I give out&amp;nbsp;SPOILERS&amp;nbsp;at the end for the next episode "Betrayal". Enjoy!</description>

                    <description>Oh no, ATA Listeners! We've got a serial killer on the loose with this week's episode and his name is Andy! Just joking, we enjoy having Andy here on ATA to the point that we have appointed him as Nico's cohost for a new section premiering on today's podcast dedicated to the show that inspired our serial killer themed title, The Following. In fact, that's not all the Andy you are getting in this episode as voicemailing extraordinaire Woo S. Kim joins him for an all new weekly discussion on Glee that obviously doesn't involve committing murderous acts of terror but I did hear that you have to watch out for buses. Anyway, besides Glee are other favorite shows didn't escape the theme of at least someone going on a violent rampage as Once upon a Time introduced Frankenstein's monster,&amp;nbsp; a deranged nerd enslaved a fairy to kill innocent Live-Action Role-Play Gamers and Castle certainly had a title that inspired a serial killer theme with Death Gone Crazy but ultimately it left us with a mystery that left us disappointed. Even the sitcoms got in on the violence as Luke played a hitman in the Modern Family version of a scene from one of the greatest movies of all time and Go On featured Mr. K taking revenge by performing dirty deeds, done dirt cheap with NFL Star Terrel Owens.
Then moving into the Airwaves Rundown Section, the killer mayhem continued as the addition of a White Collar section and the departure of our Last Resort section was coupled with the return of the always chilling serial killer Christopher Pelant on this week's Bones along with discussions on some shocking life taking moments involving presidential assassinations, conspiracy wielding senators, preaching snake charmers, crazed night&amp;ndash;school students and Barney Stenson getting married?! Yep, it's pretty much like Silence of the Lambs up in here with this week's episode, so curl up with a can of Fava Beans to give this podcast a listen at your own risk as throughout the show, someone could sneak up behind you and say "Hello Clarice" in a cold, robotic voice.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hey gang, and welcome back to&amp;nbsp;ATA's Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast. On this weeks episode, Woo and I discuss a bunch of different things, mainly focused on the latest&amp;nbsp;Arrow&amp;nbsp;episode "Trust but Verify". We talk about&amp;nbsp;Diggle's partnerships with&amp;nbsp;Ted Gayner&amp;nbsp;of the Blackhawks &amp;amp; Oliver,&amp;nbsp;Thea's attitude (that really needs adjustment), Tommy's strained relationship with his father,&amp;nbsp;Tommy &amp;amp; Laurel's awkward relationship, and of course, the Flashback cliffhanger of&amp;nbsp;Yao Fei being a traitor. But that's not all guys, as we also cover this week's digital comic book chapter "Sins of the Father", which tied in nicely to this week's episode (believe it or not). At the beginning of the episode, we also briefly touch on the news that&amp;nbsp;J.J. Abrams will be directing "Star Wars - Episode VII"&amp;nbsp;(sorry guys,&amp;nbsp;Woo dropped out&amp;nbsp;at the last moment...), the possible&amp;nbsp;Justice League movie roster,&amp;nbsp;Woo's rant&amp;nbsp;on "fans" and how they should disagree instead of saying "that sucks", and "The Huntress Returns". All this in lots more detail in this weeks episode of the&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, while listening to our various podcasts you have probably heard Michael, Nico and I use the term crackpot theory when it comes to&amp;nbsp; predicting what we think is ahead for our favorite shows but where did it come from? Well, Nico and I coined the phrase about five years ago when we began having phone conversations about a little show called Fringe. First it started with us marveling at the acting talents of John Noble and Joshua Jackson, then came the questions who are these Observer guys, is Massive Dynamic good or evil? And next thing we knew Leonard Nimoy showed up giving this show incredible credibility within the Sci-Fi genre. However, the clincher was this show introducing one of the most imaginative ideas presented television in the past 10 years, a war between multiple universes taking the concept out of comic book stories like Crisis on Infinite Earths and on to the television screen. The fact that this show went this direction simply just blew our minds and as it continued to develop the idea train ran wild for Nico and I with us throwing out all sorts of crazy predictions on where the writers were going to take this Science Fiction roller coaster ride. Eventually, as our TV conversations developed into the ATA Podcast, these predictions became known as crackpot theories since the writers of Fringe raised the bar to a level that we had to go way out in left field to even take a guess at how certain plot lines were going to be resolved. Most of the time our theories were so off that it didn't even seem like we could hit the broad side of a barn but in those rare times we were right the feeling of satisfaction was immeasurable leading to some of the best content that this podcast has ever produced.
Now obviously, with us being indebted to Fringe for providing Nico and I with some of our best and favorite discussions we've had on Across The Airwaves as we cited in our epic 100th Episode, it needed the red carpet treatment just like we gave our other favorites (Smallville and Chuck) when they came to an end by setting up a Live Show providing a retrospective on all the Fringe moments from Season 1 through the 5th season's Series Finale that simply blew our minds with crackpot theories. Unfortunately, due to Nico being on the West Coast and me being in the Midwest we had to push our Final crackpot theories on Fringe back to our recording of ATA 108, leaving me needing a cohost for this Fringe Finale Live Show. So as always our very own DC Nation/Longbow Hunters/Retro Reviews Podcast host Michael J. Petty swooped in to save the day but with Fringe's imaginative content being such a mind explosion we needed more help, which was a bit of an issue since Andy and Woo haven't watched Fringe. But that wouldn't have stopped Dr. Bishop and it certainly didn't stop me as I crossed over to get the alternate versions of Andy and Woo, my friends on the other side Doug Roewer and Lyndley St. John to join us for this Live Show. Again, don't ask me who's the alternate to each person, just kind of go with it since I'm on a roll here.
Anyway, with Doug and Lyndley who are as nuts as Nico when it comes to getting excited about crackpot theories backing up our Fringe Team, Michael and I were able to put together a great Live Show that paid a great tribute to Fringe, the Television Series of endless possibilities, which led ATA to what I think has been some of its finest moments. In other words, I present this recording of our Fringe Finale Live Show to you, the fans, cast, writers and crew who made this outstanding show that will go down in Sci-Fi History possible so what are you waiting for? Sit back and listen to this podcast, which I think you will all enjoy.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA listeners, hope springs eternal as we say goodbye to Fringe, one of the first shows we reviewed on Across the Airwaves by sending it a &amp;ldquo;White Tulip&amp;rdquo; with our heartstring tugging discussion on the Series Finale.&amp;nbsp; Hope and Forgiveness pervade our discussions this week as we discuss Castle and how Jon Huertas' performance allowed us to forgive the Castle writers for a lackluster mystery this week due to the pure force of his acting will saving a weak mystery with a strong side plot and hope for a better mystery next week. In Go On's Goal Doll episode we discuss the need for forgiveness as Ryan ditches Carrie for her friend, but how she later forgives him when he ditches the friend to spend time with her instead.&amp;nbsp; Cass seeks forgiveness for his sins from Season 6 by trying to heal the wounds of Sam and Deans relationship in our Supernatural discussion.&amp;nbsp; Finally, we discuss Walter's sacrifice and redemption in the Fringe Series Finale and we discuss our hopes for a show to fill the void left by the loss of this great show.&amp;nbsp;
We wrap up the show with our Airwaves Rundown Section that includes How I Met Your Mother, New Girl, Justified, Arrow, and the penultimate episode of Last Resort. There's also some sad news in the News with Nico section as we learn that another ATA favorite has been cancelled, but hope springs eternal as we discuss how this could be a good thing for our other favorite shows as these actors are now free to join other projects.&amp;nbsp; Join us for a great discussion that we Hope you will enjoy and won't force us to ask you for Forgiveness next week.</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA Listeners!First of all, I hope you all had a great Christmas break and that you are all ready for 2013 as much as I am.Before the Winter Hiatus started, me and Longbow Hunters/Retro Reviews co-host Woo S. Kim, both fans of FOX&amp;rsquo;s musical show Glee, talked about possibly doing reviews on the show on the regular ATA podcast and we decided to give it a go.Right after the show went on hiatus, we recorded a special long episode where we recap the first 10 episodes of the 4th season to give you listeners out there an overall review of what has been going on with the storylines and the characters of the show and what we think so far of it.Now I want to be extra clear that this is only a one-time thing: We will not be doing these long reviews on separate episodes once the show returns, it will be in the regular format just like the other shows that ATA covers. We only did this so that we could have the first half of the season covered on the podcast.I hope you Gleeks out there will enjoy this section as well as the return of Glee, which will return on Thursday, January 24h, 9PM on FOX.</description>

                    <description>Hello loyal DC Nationites, and welcome back to ATA's very own "DC Nation Podcast"! On this episode of the DC Nation Podcast, Dan &amp;amp; Michael go deep into Green Lantern: The Animated Series with the episode "Blue Hope", discussing Aya's soul, and digging even deeper into Razer &amp;amp; Aya's "Love Connection", while still getting to the good stuff of the Green/Blue Lanterns fight against the super-charged Manhunters. But once the topic switches from "Cheers" to Young Justice: Invasion's "Cornered", it's like a "Glee"&amp;nbsp;catastrophe&amp;nbsp;waiting to happen! We realize that Nightwing was being a total jerk to the Team, that Godfrey is getting REAL old, that Captain Atom should NOT be the spokesperson for the Justice League, and that Superboy &amp;amp; Miss Martian really need to get back together. And when getting to the discussion on Smallville Season 11, "Haunted - Chapter 4", your Dynamic Duo discusses Smallville's version of the "Speed Force", the Black Flash, Chloe's need for an attitude adjustment, and "Haunted"'s connection to "Justice". And fear not, for we also give our thoughts on the amazing "Batman of&amp;nbsp;Shanghai" and "Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld - Level 2" shorts!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak, somewhere in this podcast as our full reviews for this week dealt with Cora and Captain Hook breaking out of the fairytale world into the real world on Once upon a Time and Castle trying to escape the arsenal of redheads living at his apartment. Then Go On had Bob Costas make an attempt to break out of his image as a sportscaster with Modern Family beginning to break into the world of dramaedy while the gang on Big Bang Theory tried to break out of reality by turning a bad situation of being stuck on the side of the road into a Star Trek: TNG Landing Party mission. And last but not least we rounded out the week with the Person of Interest Team using the art of espionage to actually break Reese out of jail as the fantastic writers of Fringe set up a final last-ditch effort jailbreak to save September's son Michael who is the key to saving the world from the Observers. Also this podcast has got a Airwaves Rundown section featuring the addition of FX's Justified as well as a voicemail segment where Michael J. Petty gives his thoughts on the penultimate episode of Fringe and Woo Kim presents his two cents on the SHIELD TV Series news revealed in our News with Nico section.</description>

                    <description>Howdy DC Nationites,&amp;nbsp; I'm so fired up for this week's awesome DC Nation Podcast episode, we're gonna bust this post out as classic rock lyrics since...
&amp;nbsp;DC Nation is back
How about that
&amp;nbsp;It's been too long and were glad it's back
Yes, we've been let loose
&amp;nbsp;From the commentary noose
That Cartoon Network left us hanging around
We had Black Lightning in the sky
&amp;nbsp; Lanterns on a blue power high
Amethyst's videogame came alive
The Reach lies
They're bad guys
Young Justice is going to stop them from running wild
'Cause it's back
DC Nation's back!
&amp;nbsp;It's back in black!
And in case you haven't caught on already, I'm going to come out of my AC/DC Brian Johnson voice to explain that this episode is dedicated to the triumphant return of DC Nation to Cartoon Network with us reviewing the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode "Steam Lantern" and the Young Justice Invasion episode "Before the Dawn" along with two brand-new DC Nation Superhero Shorts. Also as always we have our now weekly reviews of Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville Season 11 with us taking a look at Digital Issue #28 otherwise known as Effigy Chapter 1 starring Batman and Martian Manhunter.&amp;nbsp; So with the anticipation for DC Nation's return feeling like it lasted for an eternity, I'm going to cut it with my usual jargon I put into these posts and let you get to the fantastic episode that's been seven podcasts in the making that was certainly worth the wait.</description>

                    <itunes:image href="http://assets.libsyn.com/content/5310002"/>
                    <description>Hello ATA Listeners, the question I present to you today is how you pay tribute to a character like Bond, James Bond who has graced the silver screen for 50 years with Secret Agent adventures that has spawned generations of fans and brought the male side of families together? Well, here at ATA I figured we could try something different for our show to celebrate five decades of James Bond on the silver screen. At first I thought about doing&amp;nbsp; commentaries on my favorite Bond films but we did that already with the movies leading up to The Avengers.&amp;nbsp; In other words, I began to envision something much bigger. Something that would be worthy of a character who has spanned generations, a retrospective on James Bond discussing everything that has to do with the man who many believe to be the pride of Her Majesty's Secret Service. ATA has certainly had its outstanding Retro Reviews but this was going to be the end-all be-all of podcast tributes to Mr. Bond covering everything from his on-screen creation and history to the characters most recent incarnation in the box office breaking smash hit Skyfall starring the outstanding Daniel Craig.
However, in going to the ATA Corps I ran into the issue of my talented cohosts not&amp;nbsp; feeling that they had enough background on 007 to do a retrospective, so I ended up calling one of the biggest James Bond fans I know, Agent 008 1/2 with the flaming pants himself, Kyle Franchi. And together we were able make my dream a reality by creating James Bond 50th Anniversary Tribute Podcast that was made worthy of its title through us talking about a variety of topics such as&amp;nbsp; a in-depth review on Skyfall, an analysis of Bond actors/villains/women, an oral history on the Bond Film Franchise and much more including stories about our breaking and entering loving friend Steve. Hi Steve! Yes like it or not you're going to be referenced in this podcast but it's only because we love you and associate you to James Bond as much as Sean Connery.
Anyway, in going back to the podcast there was so much great content stuffed into this 50th Anniversary Tribute we had to make it into a four part podcast miniseries beginning with the episode that's posted below but for For Your Eyes Only is a brief dossier explaining what's in store for our James Bond 50th Anniversary Tribute Podcast over the next four missions or episodes!!!

Mission One: Explains how Kyle and I became fascinated with the James Bond Franchise and gives a in-depth review on the most recently released film starring Daniel Craig as Ian Fleming's James Bond, the Sam Mendes directed film Skyfall.
Mission Two: Kyle and I give a report card to each of the actors who have played James Bond along with talking about our favorite Bond Girls and Villains.
Mission Three: Kyle and I give a full-blown oral history retrospective on the James Bond Film Franchise from Dr. No to Skyfall going behind the scenes on its triumphs and tribulations including the debacle surrounding the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never Again starring the great Sean Connery.
Mission Four: The podcast miniseries wraps itself up with Kyle and I taking a look at the various James Bond video games that attributed to success for the modern era of the Bond Franchise including one of the most popular games of all time N64's Goldeneye. We also discuss what we think is next for the Bond Film Franchise with the two films slated to be released after Skyfall, providing several crackpot theories on how to salvage the Quantum/Mr. White story arc that fell apart in the rush to make Quantum of Solace.

Alright, now that you have your objectives it's time to stop by Q Branch to retrieve your weapon, fire up the Ashton Martin DB5 and listen to Part 1 of this outstanding podcast that's shaken but not stirred to be something that Bond fans everywhere will love!&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, the title of this week's CBS centric podcast is a reference to a former hit sitcom Welcome Back Kotter, a show about a guy who returns to his former High School as a teacher because our review for Person of Interest was about an episode where Finch kind of did the same thing by going back to school as a substitute teacher to save the life of a student. However, this theme doesn't stop here as we review a The Big Bang Theory episode where Sheldon is taken back to school by the Human Resources Department to learn what's considered to be sexual harassment and with our lone Airwaves Rundown show for the week a.k.a. Sherlock, Nico criticizes the most recent episode for hiring an actress that really needs to go back to acting school. All right, so now that class is in session, give this podcast episode a listen for an informative News with Nico section, great discussion and just flat out all around fun from Nico and myself.</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA Listeners, on this week's edition of Across The Airwaves that we numbered as a .5&amp;nbsp; since it was too short to be classified as a full episode, the Doctor is in as Nico and I review the highly anticipated 2012 Doctor Who Christmas Special entitled The Snowmen!!! Now as we went into watching this epic new adventure for the Doctor, which included the voice of Sir Ian McKellen, Nico and I thought it was going to take a bit to get back in the swing of things with Amy and Rory being gone but this great show didn't even miss a beat as Matt Smith gave another stellar performance and we both fell madly in love with the Doctor's new companion played by Jenna&amp;ndash;Louise Coleman who is going to fill Karen Gillian's shoes beautifully. In fact, Nico and I have fallen so head over heels for this character that we are on the verge of fighting over her so it's going to be interesting how our reviews on ATA are going to play out over the next half of Series 7.&amp;nbsp;
Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself because if I go on ahead about Clara, the new companion any longer, it's going to take away your reason for listening to this great podcast episode.&amp;nbsp; So with that give this show a listen to find out why we simply love the direction of Doctor Who is going despite saying goodbye to the Ponds and in addition you will get our crackpot theories about the mystery surrounding Clara Oswin Oswald, which structured this Christmas Special as a midseason premiere designed to set up the second half of Series 7 set to premiere in April.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, welcome back! On this exciting episode of ATA's DC Nation Podcast, Dan and Michael cover the latest TWO chapters of Bryan Q. Miller's 'Smallville Season 11' 11x03 entitled "Haunted". They discuss, in great detail, the Black Flash, Clark and Bart's relationship, the Tess-in-Lex's-head arc, and much more that happened in the two chapters AND what they would like to happen in the Smallville Universe. However, the Smallville discussion is NOT the main event as this Dynamic Duo also do a commentary on the animated film/three part season finale entitled "Justice League: Starcrossed - The Movie". This is a great film that shows how great the JL really are, that shows a better love story than Twilight, and gives us all hope for a live-action Justice League film (that's slated to be released in 2015). Don't worry DC Nation fans, next week's episode will feature the return of Green Lantern: The Animated Series AND Young Justice: Invasion (along with a new episode of Smallville Season 11), so bare with us through this final commentary episode so we can discuss what's been on our mind for the past few months!</description>

And thankfully the Television Gods looked fondly down upon us by giving us a lighter schedule where we only had to cover Fringe and our Airwaves Rundown shows (including the midseason or season finales for Homeland, The Simpsons, How I Met Your Mother and Burn Notice) on this week's podcast.</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, it's Dan here proud to present you with an DC Nation Podcast that combined us giving our thoughts on the newly released Man of Steel Trailer and our review on Smallville Season 11 #25: Haunted Chapter 1 into one of our best Superman discussions ever. Then we follow it up with this episode's main event our audio commentary on the controversial DC Animated Film, Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman!
And if this podcast's title wasn't a dead giveaway, this Batman movie can best be described as ladies night for Bruce Wayne but let's just say the feeling is just not right as The Dark Knight's alter ego reacts to an abundance of beautiful women in a Peter Parker spastic manner rather than being the usual mysterious billionaire playboy who keeps the ladies at an arms distance. In addition, there's the little issue of one of the most uncomfortable scenes throughout the whole entire DC Animated Universe where Bruce Wayne hits on Barbara Gordon, which is so wrong on so many levels especially from my perspective as a huge Batgirl/Nightwing shipper. I mean, Batman can be described as a lot of things dark, awesome, paranoid but pedophile who hits on college girls is not one of them. I love you Bruce Timm and all your content but I'm not feeling a Batman/Batgirl romance.
However, don't think this commentary turned out to be a complete bust as Michael and I still made watching the movie a great time despite our discrepancies and we did make some interesting points about how this movie acted as a bridge between Batman The Animated Series and Batman Beyond as well as why a time jump to the future was necessary at this point for the Batman side of the DC Animated Universe. But if that's not enough to get you interested in the commentary for this week feel free to skip it but I advise at least to check out the Superman discussions we had in this episode because as I said before they were really great and as an added bonus we throw in information regarding when DC Nation is returning to Cartoon Network.</description>

                    <description>All right ATA Listeners, I expect you to sing along with me as I bust out: JOY TO THE WORLD, IT HASN'T ENDED! THE MAYANS ARE FULL OF CRAP! Okay, that's enough with the singing, I don't want anybody hurting themselves. However, you can hear us repeat the sounding joy on the 2012 end of the world prophecy being complete hogwash by listening to our reviews on the midseason finales for Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest as well as a spirited discussion on a standard episode of Fringe that can be best described as Walter Bishop's Flying Circus. In addition to going over a Fringe episode that you need to see to believe, we have another edition of our Airwaves Rundown section with more voicemails from our buddy Woo Kim and an extended Arrow segment where Andy joins us to give his thoughts on the show's impressive midseason finale.
By the way, I apologize on the late release of this episode we were having some server issues on the ATA Website that are now resolved.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's Christmastime in Tinseltown again meaning this week's podcast covers episodes of our favorite shows that either had a Christmas theme or was used as a Midseason Finale. Some of our favorites like Castle ended up fitting into both categories giving us one of the best Christmas episodes I've ever seen from a Police Procedure Series. Go On also added Christmas spirit into their Midseason Finale but it wasn't as effective because the zany humor we've come to expect from the show was sacrificed this week for character development, but we sucked up our disappointment realizing the series would become boring if it stayed in one place.
As for the returning ABC, Fox and CW shows we cover they are writers decided to just go the Midseason Finale with Once upon a Time finally getting us back to the place that had us excited for its current Second Season in the first place, Supernatural continuing its rise back to greatness through creating a turning point in Dean's relationship with the vampire Benny and the 150th episode of Bones showing us how far this once outstanding show as fallen. Meanwhile, on CBS it appears that the Network Executives are going to have their employees work towards the holidays as we review the penultimate to the Midseason Finale episodes of How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest.
At the same time on the Fox Network, the executives over there are going to run Fringe&amp;nbsp; through the holidays since the people behind that show are sadly on their way to a long but hopefully not eternal hiatus. The good news is this week's episode was a pretty strong indicator that Fringe is going to go down swinging as we got one of the best fight scenes I've seen on television next to Buffy, Angel, Smallville and what they are currently doing on Arrow but this was almost like watching the fight scene at the end of The Matrix on a TV Show and it literally blew my mind!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So I guess there's a lot to look forward to with it being Christmas time in Tinseltown again and we better enjoy it because a show like Fringe only comes once in a lifetime.</description>

                    <description>What's up, Doc? I mean, ATA Listeners? On this week's episode of Across The Airwaves things got kind of looney with us actually liking the midseason of Revolution. Yeah I know, we might sound like we've really gone off our rockers on that one but my use of the word looney is about much more than that as we witnessed characters on our favorite shows for this week acting like a bunch of Toons as in cartoons by doing some pretty funny but wacky stuff. First of all, we had Modern Family's Cam get caught hanging from a tree in a costume from the musical Cats, then we had Ryan get in a old man fight with a blind man on Go On and Dean Winchester actually got to somewhat be a cartoon character as a psychokinetic man's abilities gave him a first-hand experience of the great film&amp;nbsp; "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?".&amp;nbsp; However, what I think completely stole the show on the term looney was this week's Big Bang Theory where we got some hilarious scenes with both Sheldon and Howard getting naked over wanting the rights to a parking spot, which was made even more looney by the fact that Sheldon doesn't drive.
Again, like with everything there's good looney and bad looney and boy did we get some things to roll our eyes at here as Once upon a Time had Captain Hook magically take a heart out of a character's body, Person of Interest featured a couple that took a hit out on each other over the wife having a miscarriage and&amp;nbsp; Bones made the ridiculous decision to have Booth perform standup comedy while scaring the crap out of us that a beloved character was going to have an affair. Yep, that's a show that for sure needs to say that's all folks. In fact, with that line I'm going to take after the great cinema icon Porky Pig and use this as my exit leaving you to a episode that Nico described on Twitter as a great discussion supported by some excellent voicemail material from Woo.</description>

                    <description>Hey everyone and welcome back to ATA's very own Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast! After a week hiatus, Woo and myself could not wait to get right back into talking about Arrow, and to help us on this episode is a very special guest and a friend to the podcast, Alisa Lea Gossage! On this episode, the News Section goes a bit long (as in a whole 30 minutes!!!) as the three of us discuss the development of DC Comics's other potential CW series entitled "Amazon", based off of the Wonder Woman character and comics. After a half hour of discussion on that, we then get into the 1st Geoff Johns episode of Arrow entitled "Muse of Fire". We talk about Tommy, Hollie, Huntress, what a hero is and what their "codes" are, and the identity of John Barrowman's character&amp;nbsp;previously&amp;nbsp;known only as the "Well-Dressed Man". After this, we discuss TWO comic book chapters of Arrow entitled "Boy's Night" and "[REC.]"! Plus, don't forget to show GreenArrowTV some love and check their site along with us after the Closing for Spoilers of the next episode!

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, with most of our favorite shows being on hiatus during the week due to Thanksgiving being celebrated in America, I decided to give this episode a title that's a variation on the most popular Thanksgiving song "To Grandmother's House We Go" because all we did during this week of television was somehow go over the bloody river on Revolution and through the city streets on Castle to a Thanksgiving feast with the Support Group on Go On. But take note on the Question mark at the end of this title because we still don't know how the cast of Revolution crossed the river to give us a terrible episode in the tunnels underneath Philadelphia that featured the worst use of the song Kashmir that I've ever seen. In fact, it was so bad we decided to use the song for our closing just to make up for the travesty of the legendary Led Zeppelin's music being used for a stupid hallucination scene that was all about false advertising.
Anyway, going back to the theme of this week's episode, what would be a Thanksgiving Feast without the sides coming from our Airwaves Rundown Section where we discuss some really great episodes of Homeland, New Girl, Vegas, Ben and Kate, Sons of Anarchy and more along with an episode of Bones that had the potential of being outstanding like the Veterans Day episode but ended up falling short.&amp;nbsp;</description>

Now with that being said you're probably what topic is worthy of five people being on one podcast?&amp;nbsp; Well, since it is our 100th Episode we decided to go with something that would be accessible to all of our fans whether your an original ATA, DC Nation or Arrow Podcast Listener and that's a behind the scenes look at Across The Airwaves. In other words, since Andy is the new guy around here we brought him on this episode to ask the burning questions that you fans may have about our show like our secret origins, drama that may have gone on in the making of this podcast, what makes us want to get on the air every week and&amp;nbsp; How I Met Your Michael.
Then, with this being a podcast dedicated to providing news and opinions on the Entertainment Industry, we have Andy moderate a roundtable discussion about TV shows, comic books and movies, that even the most casual Entertainment enthusiasts can follow. However,&amp;nbsp; I should stop trying to explain and just let you experience the fun, laughs, impressions, silence and frustration that made this 100th episode a spectacular and proved if you'll listen to 100 episodes, then I will make 100 more just to be the man who records next to Nico, Michael, Andy and Woo.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, sorry about the delay but looking on the bright side of Nico's computer crashing and the Thanksgiving holiday throwing off our production schedule, it became a no-brainer to give ATA 99 featuring reviews on Once upon a Time, Castle, Modern Family, Supernatural, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest and Fringe for the week of 11/11 the episode title of It Fell on Black Friday because this episode is coming out on well, Black Friday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year. &amp;nbsp;Also as an added bonus to this great deal that doesn't even require a wait in line, we're going to throw in our Rundown Section &amp;nbsp;with a Bones voicemail from Woo and a burning question about the characters on Revolution crossing the river, that's all available for the one low price of completely free.</description>

On this exciting episode of LBH, Michael and Woo test out their new format to covering Arrow episodes starting with episode 6 entitled "Legacies".

Discussion points include the Royal Flush Gang, Tommy's destiny/fate, Oliver becoming a hero in his own right, Taylor Swift, and the difference between DC's characters vs Marvel's. But that's not all as the Dynamic Duo also cover the latest digital comic book for Arrow entitled "Moscow", which spawns some more good discussion. And don't forget, Dan, Nico, and Andy share their thoughts on the episode as well! All in a days work for the Arrow Podcast!</description>

Podcasting &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; &amp;ndash; The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the podcast Across The Airwaves. Its multi&amp;ndash;year mission: to provide weekly television episode reviews, seek out entertainment news and give opinions, to boldly go where no TV watcher has gone before. (Imagine Original Star Trek Theme playing introducing Dan Schmidt as Captain Kirk, Nico Reifsteck as Mr. Spock and Andy Behbakht as Dr. McCoy.
If you ATA Listeners haven't figured it out already this week's podcast is dedicated to the exploration of not just space but anything that can be classified as the final frontier as we reviewed episodes of Once upon a Time, Castle, Modern Family, Supernatural, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest and Fringe where our favorite characters used beanstalks, romance, a knockoff version of Comic Con, bus rides and even Star Trek: The Next Generation DVDs to explore the places where no man has gone before. And if that's not enough adventure for you we've got another addition of our Rundown Section where we discuss Bones' return from hiatus and the epic two-hour midseason premiere of USA Network's Burn Notice that sure lit up some fireworks.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, when it comes to this week's podcast, IT'S ALIVE!!! as we review episodes of Once upon a Time, Castle, Modern Family, Supernatural, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest and Fringe where a main character had to contend with a physical or metaphorical Frankenstein monster of their own creation. Yep, when it came to creating monsters this week are favorite shows had everything from the actual Frankenstein monster to Penny on The Big Bang Theory's newfound success at Community College is secretly thanks to her gal pals that are scientists and Castle's pesky Triple Killer who just doesn't know how to die. We even had a ventriloquist dummy that resembled Modern Family's Jay and a character turned themselves into a freaking Observer on this week's Fringe!
In addition to this shockingness, Nico gives us a special news section where he discusses thoughts on Disney's very own Frankenstein monster people might go after with their torches and pitchforks, STAR WARS EPISODE VII! Also we tackled our very own creation that we've made beginning with this third season of ATA, the Airwaves Rundown section with our brief thoughts on Revolution, New Girl, Vegas, Last Resort, Elementary, Arrow and more TV shows we watch that we just don't have time to cover in a full review section.</description>

                    <description>Hey DC Nationites, and welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast! On this week's episode Dan and I discuss Chapter 21 of Smallville: Season 11, "Detective, Part 9" by our good friend Bryan Q. Miller. But after that, we decided that we couldn't get enough of Batman and Mr. Freeze (as well as Barbara Gordon) so we host another DC Animated Original Movie commentary on the Batman: The Animated Series animated film: "Batman &amp;amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero". So pull out your VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray (is it even on Blu-Ray?), and/or Digital Copy and fire it up, because with all this talk about Batman, you're going to need to watch what we're talking about. Enjoy!</description>

                    <description>Hey guys, welcome back to the&amp;nbsp;#1&amp;nbsp;Arrow podcast on the Internet (at this point) entitled&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast, brought to you by&amp;nbsp;Across the Airwaves Productions! On this exciting episode of LBH, Michael and Woo are joined by ATA co-host&amp;nbsp;Nico&amp;nbsp;Reifsteck! Before diving into Arrow, they cover the current&amp;nbsp;Arrow news,&amp;nbsp;Disney buying LucasFilm&amp;nbsp;and what that means for both Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and of course Michael's&amp;nbsp;comic picks of the week&amp;nbsp;and why you should all read&amp;nbsp;Superman: Earth One, Volume 2. But after about 20 minutes into the show, they quickly switch from the news into the episode "An Innocent Man" where a lot of stuff went down. The trio talk about their thoughts on Detective Lance,&amp;nbsp;Felicity Smoak, what may happen with&amp;nbsp;Walter, and give their theories on who the&amp;nbsp;Well-Dressed Man&amp;nbsp;may be, as well as predictions for next week. And don't worry folks, they play&amp;nbsp;Dan &amp;amp; Andy's thoughts on the episode as well as read the&amp;nbsp;Twitter comments&amp;nbsp;of the week. The group also covers the 4th Arrow digital chapter entitled "Diggle", which gives more background on Diggle's life as a soldier. And don't think we forgot the&amp;nbsp;Spoilers! At the end of the fade out music, Michael give you all the spoilers on the next episode "Damaged", brought to you by&amp;nbsp;GreenArrowTV!</description>

                    <description>Greetings ATA Listeners, it's Count Danula and I've come to drink your blood! Actually, I have returned once again to introduce this week's Across The Airwaves' Giant Sized Halloween Spooktacular! Now, while listening to this special extended episode many of you mortals might ask yourself what's the matter with Dan and Nico because the two hosts who are normally on the same page had vastly different opinions regarding the week's schedule of their favorite shows this especially when it came to the controversial Season Finale of Alphas. In fact, things got so batty Dan had to bring in another cohost for covering Once upon a Time! Scary, huh?
Well before you go spreading the news all over Twitter, bringing our new ATA Corps Member Andy (Samaritan93) in to discuss Once upon a Time on a weekly basis was something decided by Nico and Dan together so you listeners can get to know him before he starts his podcast dedicated to ABC's SHIELD TV Series that's supposedly premiering next Fall.
Going back to this episode, for those of you worried that Nico and Dan's difference in viewpoints turned them into werewolves ready to tear each other apart they were able to reconcile through their love for Fringe spawning a joint crackpot theory that a certain Fringe Team member who was killed in this week's episode might not necessarily stay dead or potentially still be alive. Then, from here things just kept getting better for Dan and Nico as they went into this week's Rundown Section with their thoughts on New Girl, Vegas, Vampire Diaries (the show starring my bloodsucking friends the Salvatore Brothers) and more. So now that the stage is set, I really must be going because it's almost sunrise but as I fly off into the fading moonlight, hear my compelling cry...listen to this Halloween podcast it's simply something to die for!</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, with Cartoon Network's sudden decision to put DC Nation (Green Lantern: The Animated Series &amp;amp; Young Justice Invasion) on hiatus until January, I bet you're thinking the Angel of death awaits for our podcast as Michael and I are going to be stuck doing more comic book discussions but just because DC isn't providing us with new animation doesn't mean we can't go back and discuss their great animated content of the past. In other words, we are going to start a series of audio commentaries on the DC Animated Films beginning today with an old classic Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and wrapping itself up hopefully just before DC Nation returns from hiatus with the most recent film to come out Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1.
However, with us digging through the past, that does not mean new DC Comics content won't be discussed on the podcast as we will still be reviewing Smallville Season 11 with this week's episode and there are plans in the works for talking about the big story arc going on in Batman comics, Death of the Family.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, between Castle finally taking us on a trip with him to the Hamptons, Nico being out of town and the computer problems that made this episode come out so incredibly late, the inspiration behind the editing of this week's reviews for Once upon a Time, Alphas, Castle, Modern Family, Supernatural, The Big Bang Theory and Person of Interest would have to be me wanting to take a vacation. However, even though a vacation is all I ever wanted by the end of the week, don't worry we're not going on hiatus as I understand that the show must go on. In addition, all the blood and sweat that went into this episode was worthwhile as it had some really solid discussions especially when it came to Castle and Supernatural, so what are you waiting for? Give this episode a listen, I think you'll enjoy it!</description>

                    <description>Hey everybody and welcome back to ATA's very own Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast! In this long-awaited episode, Michael J. Petty and Woo S! Kim bring in their first guest-host to LBH, Andy Behbakht! And after about 20 minutes of hearing this trio rant about Arrow's full-season pick up, the DC Comics picks of the week, and the&amp;nbsp;interview&amp;nbsp;Michael and Dan did with Arrow executive producer Marc Guggenheim, they get into covering the latest episode of Arrow entitled "Lone Gunman". &amp;nbsp;A lot of interesting theories are brought up about Deadshot's victims, Moria's intentions as a parent, Tommy and Laurel's relationship, Oliver's mission, and which character Michael just wants to die. But that's not all, after a very long recap and review on this episode (and after hearing Dan &amp;amp; Nico's thoughts, as well as the thoughts from the Twitterverse), the trio then go on to discuss the latest digital comic chapter explaining China White's origin. This gets into some heated discussion about origin stories in the comics and whether or not super villains should have origin stories. The answer will shock you! We apologize that this episode went a little (or a lot) longer than we expected guys, and the next time Andy joins us we will try and move things along, but until that time comes, enjoy the podcast!</description>

Special thanks to LBH co-host&amp;nbsp;Woo S! Kim&amp;nbsp;and our good friend and follower&amp;nbsp;Andy Behbakht&amp;nbsp;(from K-Site TV) for the questions that they sent into Dan &amp;amp; I.

We hope you're all enjoying our show so far, and we hope that you have also been enjoying Arrow as much as we have. On this thrilling episode of LBH, Michael &amp;amp; Woo discuss the 2nd (and latest) episode of Arrow entitled "Honor Thy Father" (but don't worry, Dan &amp;amp; Nico's thoughts are in there too), which does off the rails as they discuss their feelings about&amp;nbsp;Detective Lance&amp;nbsp;(and where he may be going...),&amp;nbsp;Tommy Merlyn, and Oliver's new line, "You have failed this city". Also, look for the Finding Nemo reference and why you should all go watch&amp;nbsp;Batman '89!&amp;nbsp;We also discuss&amp;nbsp;Woo's birthday, the latest news about the&amp;nbsp;Justice League film, and why&amp;nbsp;Bryan Q. Miller&amp;nbsp;should write for Arrow (and why you should all watch it). But we can't forget about the latest&amp;nbsp;Digital Chapter&amp;nbsp;of Arrow entitled "Prey" where we learn some interesting things about Moria Queen. All of this and more on the latest episode of Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, we hope we didn't loose you in all the recent confusion that has gone on surrounding Cartoon Network's schedule change regarding DC Nation and all that that implies. But don't worry, we're still here to cover our favorite shows! Although we had no new material air on Cartoon Network this weekend, Dan and Michael still get to talk about why DC Nation was moved, what that means for us fans, how this is a disservice, and how you can help! One of the ways you can help is by signing the petition to "Save DC Nation", which is located on the right side of our website! And even though we bought the episodes of Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Young Justice: Invasion on iTunes before they were taken down (they were excellent by the way), we decided to wait to cover those episodes until they air on Cartoon Network in January so that those who missed them don't feel left out.
But speaking of being left out, we aren't loosing any new Smallville episodes, as we continue the discussion on Smallville: &amp;nbsp;Season 11 with "Detective, Part 7" featuring a great scene between Lois and Toyman, as well as some incredible action sequences with Clark, Batman, Mr. Freeze, and Prankster that we can only imagine on the show. So thanks guys for tuning in, and listen to this episode to find out what we'll be doing each week on this show before DC Nation comes back in January, because what we're doing is going to be great (and no, it's not JUST covering DC Comics...)!
Editors Note: I introduce this week's Smallville section as Detective Chapter 6 but it really should be Chapter 7. Sorry about that, it's totally my bad. &amp;ndash; Dan</description>

                    <description>Hello and welcome back all DC Comics/Green Arrow/Arrow&amp;nbsp;fans! We're glad you joined us for this second episode of&amp;nbsp;Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast! We hope you're all enjoying our show so far, and we hope that you have also been enjoying Arrow as much as we have. On this thrilling episode of LBH, Michael &amp;amp; Woo discuss the 2nd (and latest) episode of Arrow entitled "Honor Thy Father" (but don't worry, Dan &amp;amp; Nico's thoughts are in there too), which does off the rails as they discuss their feelings about&amp;nbsp;Detective Lance&amp;nbsp;(and where he may be going...),&amp;nbsp;Tommy Merlyn, and Oliver's new line, "You have failed this city". Also, look for the Finding Nemo reference and why you should all go watch&amp;nbsp;Batman '89!&amp;nbsp;We also discuss&amp;nbsp;Woo's birthday, the latest news about the&amp;nbsp;Justice League film, and why&amp;nbsp;Bryan Q. Miller&amp;nbsp;should write for Arrow (and why you should all watch it). But we can't forget about the latest&amp;nbsp;Digital Chapter&amp;nbsp;of Arrow entitled "Prey" where we learn some interesting things about Moria Queen. All of this and more on the latest episode of Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hey everyone, and welcome to&amp;nbsp;Across the Airwaves' latest podcast&amp;nbsp;endeavor known as "Longbow Hunters: The Arrow Podcast". This show is obviously dedicated to the hit new CW series "Arrow", and on this first episode&amp;nbsp;Woo S! Kim&amp;nbsp;and I are back to cover the highly anticipated first half of the&amp;nbsp;CW's Super-Powered Wednesdays&amp;nbsp;with "Pilot". The Pilot was a great episode and great way to start off this new series as Woo &amp;amp; I dive into discussion on this new version of&amp;nbsp;Oliver Queen, this relationships, his friends, and his family. But that's not all we cover! We also cover the San Diego Comic Con/Arrow Day Special Edition Arrow #1&amp;nbsp;comic, along with the first digital chapter of the Arrow comic that follows the series (with awesome art by Longbow Hunters writer/artist&amp;nbsp;Mike Grell)! We've been waiting for this show for 6 months, and it did not disappoint! We're glad to be here and give you all our thoughts on this show every week. But don't worry,&amp;nbsp;Dan &amp;amp; Nico&amp;nbsp;are still a part of this too! Dan sent us his thoughts on the Pilot episode, so we put them into the podcast. You can hear Nico's thoughts on the upcoming&amp;nbsp;ATA Episode 94&amp;nbsp;during the "Airwaves Rundown" section. Also, we have to thank&amp;nbsp;GreenArrowTV&amp;nbsp;for the Spoilers that Dan &amp;amp; I talk about in the "Arrow Spoilers" section after the closing music at the end of the episode. We hope you enjoy our first episode guys, and please remember it was our&amp;nbsp;first&amp;nbsp;LBH podcast covering live material on our own (we've only covered past stuff before), so when you call in or send us an email, try not to be to harsh, okay? Also, details about our "Arrow Day Issue #1 Giveaway" are in this episode, listen for more!</description>

                    <pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 21:41:45 +0000</pubDate>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is titled &amp;ldquo;Slow Ride&amp;rdquo; as the writers of our favorite TV shows took it easy on story development with the set of episodes we reviewed to give us what Nico and I called a slow week of television. I don't know if it was Person of Interest being preempted due to the presidential election but many of the shows we watched this week were lacking action as character development and overarching stories stayed in place. In fact, Bones as you'll hear in our Airwaves Rundown section was downright boring this week!
Now, this philosophy didn't apply to all the shows that aired this week as the sitcoms (Go On, The Big Bang Theory and two episodes of Modern Family) all had solid outings that delivered big laughs. In addition, Once upon a Time and Supernatural made huge strides in making up for the shortcomings their shows had during the previous season but this still did not save this week from being deemed as slow. We even thought we could make up for this issue by filling in the place Person of Interest left open in our schedule with a full review of the week's Alphas episode but that turned out to be slow as well with things needing to be ramped up into the Season Finale.
&amp;nbsp;However, where Alphas needed to ramp up the new CW show Arrow hit the ground running with one of the best new pilots of the Fall 2012 TV Season, right up there with ABCs Last Resort. I personally thought Arrow was better but Nico and others might disagree with me on that one because I'm kind of biased when it comes to superheroes and I really miss watching Smallville on a weekly basis. Anyway, I do agree with Nico's review on the pilot for Arrow given in our Rundown sections where he raves about the new series calling it an action show that looks nothing like a CW teenybopper show but something more&amp;nbsp; reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Batman or the Bourne Movies.
I also piggyback onto Nico's positive reviews with my comic book based theories on how the series next five seasons are going to play out but for my full review on the pilot itself you're going to have to check out my section on Michael and Woo's new show Longbow Hunters, the ATA podcast slowly dedicated to just reviewing episodes of Arrow.&amp;nbsp; So from here what you listeners need to do is check out this podcast episode to stay updated on TV Shows that act as your old favorites and then check out Longbow Hunters to hear about Arrow, the new show that all of you should be watching especially if you are having Smallville or DC Nation withdrawals.</description>

                    <description>Hello our loyal DC Nationites and welcome back to Across the Airwaves' very own DC Nation Podcast! This episode is entitled "Gates of Fire" for a few reasons. In Green Lantern: The Animated Series, Hal and the gang (minus Razer) have to deal with angry Guardians, an army of Manhunters, and the second half of Season 1's "big bad": the Anti-Monitor! On the GLTAS discussion, Dan and I speculate just where did "Monty" send Hal and when (and where) does Sinestro come into play this season, as well as how to bring Razer back into the fold. Oh, and Lion King...
But that's not all on this Week 30! On Young Justice: Invasion, the team has to deal with ex-Aqualad Manta and his team of super villains (including under-cover Artemis aka Tigress)! And to make things worse, Dan and I think they not only know who the Partner is, but the identity of the real traitor against the Young Justice team! They also go into another tangent about how to kill Lagoon Boy, and in 45 seconds, they fixed all the relationships on the show to make all of the fans happy.
Unfortunately, there was no new Smallville: Season 11 chapter this week, but Dan and I do talk about the latest DC Nation Mythbusters, New Teen Titans, as well as another "World's Dumbest" from Aardman Entertainment. I also give my input on what you DC Nation fans should go out and buy immediately (hint: they both have to do with Batman) and I also read (sort of...) an email to the DC Nation Podcast from new listener and ATA supporter @Samaritan93!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode title is dedicated to Once upon a Time and Supernatural returning to our slate of weekly reviews with season premieres that took both shows to a whole new world. First off, the writers of Once upon a Time changed things up with restoring all of the fairytale characters memories and having events in the fairytale world happen simultaneously with the real world instead of relying on Lost style flashbacks. Then using the sounds of classic rock new Supernatural show runner Jeremy Carver brought back us back to the more kick but feel we remember from previous seasons as a much tougher Dean Winchester broke out of Purgatory to reunite with his brother Sam.
Now for what Nico and I thought of these epic new changes that took place with two of our favorite shows? You've got to give this podcast a listen but for those of you that aren't a Once upon a Time or Supernatural fan, tune in anyway because we've got discussions on Castle, the midseason finale for Warehouse 13, Alphas, Go On, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Fringe and just about everything else that was worth watching on TV this week in our new Airwaves Rundown section.</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites and welcome back to Across the Airwaves' very own (and so far only) DC Nation Podcast!!! On this week's episode of DCNP, Dan and I cover the returns of two of our favorite shows to watch (and review): Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Young Justice: Invasion! The Green Lantern episode "The New Guy" was great as it introduced new GL of Sector 2814 "Guy Gardner" as well as the new villain for the second half of the season, and of course, setting up Hal's role in the coming Crisis. We even get our friend Giancarlo Volpe to Tweet us the answer to a question we had about what Hal Jordan eats in space, stay tuned...
Speaking of crisis', the Young Justice episode "Satisfaction" was about some more, personal crisis's happening in the lives of our favorite heroes, including Superboy, Miss Martian, Nightwing, Kid Flash, Blue Beetle, and even the original Roy Harper aka Arsenal. But not only that, this Young Justice episode brings on some heated discussion on whether or not "Batman: Under the Red Hood" falls into the Earth-16 (aka Young Justice Universe) continuity and if the currently deceased Robin (Jason Todd) will return to team-up with fellow Outlaws: Arsenal and Starfire. (As well as shout-outs to Otis in both Young Justice and Smallville!!!)
On top of that, there are more DC Nation Shorts to cover as we briefly talk "DC Nation Mythbusters", a new "New Teen Titans" short (as well as talk about what Teen Titans Go! should be...), and a great/heartbreaking "Super Best Friends Forever". But that's not all!!! As Michael starts off this podcast with news from Batman writer Scott Snyder himself on what's in store for the Bat-Family in his&amp;nbsp;upcoming&amp;nbsp;"Death of The Family" story arc, featuring the return of the Joker! And while we're on the subject of comics, we also review last week's Chapter 18 of Smallville: Season 11 with 11x02 "Detective, Part 6" featuring a shocking cliffhanger on who the major villain of this episode is, and showing us that Clark Kent can still inspire good in the darkest of knights. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and shout outs to Michael Wen, Andy Behbakht, and Josh Winchester! All this and more on Week 29 of DC Nation!!!</description>

                    <description>With this week's ATA Episode we felt like Walter on the Season Premiere of Fringe as this week got us lost in a future world of new TV pilots where our favorite shows of yesterday like Chuck seem to be drifting a way and all we ever knew was last year's tube (TV Schedule). So to help you navigate through this foreign land&amp;nbsp; known as the 2012&amp;ndash;13 TV season filled with all sorts of things new we're giving you a monster sized episode featuring reviews from our returning favorites (Castle, Alphas, Warehouse 13, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Fringe and Doctor Who) as well as a second edition of our Airwaves Rundown section where we analyze all of the new pilots to tell you which ones are worth watching.
On that note, the length of this podcast may seem extraneous but if there is a show you don't want to hear about while listening to our Enhanced Podcast just press the skip button on your iPod or other portable device to move on to the next chapter or review so you don't feel like you have to listen to all 2 1/2 hours of this episode. There is just a bunch of new stuff to cover at the beginning of this particular TV Season and a long podcast episode was the best way to do that for your listening pleasure.&amp;nbsp; In other words, thanks for bearing with us on this one and we promise we'll have a shorter episode for you next week once we narrow down what shows we're going to follow this upcoming season.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites and welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast Season 1 Finale!!! Why is this a finale you might ask? Well, because we are finally going to be closing shop on our DC Comics Summer Comic Book Reviews and will be transitioning back to Cartoon Network's DC Nation Block next week (Week 29)! But, until next week, Dan &amp;amp; I come back to wrap up the month of September where we cover DC's "Zero Month". The zero issues that we cover on this podcast include: Green Lantern (the first appearance of new GL of 2814 "Simon Baz"), Justice League (which is a whole issue devoted to the JL's amazing back-story (and soon to be member) SHAZAM!), Earth-2 (similar to JL 0, but this time talking about one-time Mr.&amp;nbsp;Terrific&amp;nbsp;aka Terry Sloan), Supergirl, Detective Comics, Batman, Nightwing, Red Hood and The Outlaws, and Batgirl! Sadly, at the time of recording, the zero issues for Aquaman, Batman: The Dark Knight (continuing Batman's origin), Superman&amp;nbsp;(starring Jor-El!), and Teen Titans&amp;nbsp;(covering Tim Drake's origin as Red Robin) were not available, so we did not record on them (although I read them and they are all worth the buy!). But that's not all folks! We also cover Smallville 11x2 Detective Part 5, where Clark interrogates Bruno Mannheim as Batman and his loyal sidekick plan their next move! All this and more in the latest DC Nation Podcast!!!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's episode we're turning out the lights as we delve into the modern world without electricity featured on NBC's new series Revolution to tell you if it's worth watching on a weekly basis. At the same time this review on Revolution's Pilot episode headlines a new section that will be a part of our original ATA Podcasts entitled Airwaves Rundown where Nico and I will briefly discuss new TV shows that we've watched and programs we think you should be watching that we just don't have time to review on a weekly basis. This section will also be a place where we will keep you updated on shows that we're not so enthusiastic about reviewing on a weekly basis because they've creatively gone off the rails and yes we're talking to you Bones.
Beyond, our brand spanking new section, the main portion of this week's podcast is dedicated to keeping up with our reviews on the new seasons of Alphas, Warehouse 13 and Doctor Who. In other words, that's your cue to get excited because Fall TV is on the Horizon and we here at ATA are living up to the hype with an episode giving you some old favorites with a little dash of something new, so what you waiting for?! Get out your iPod and give this episode a listen ASAP because you never know the power might go off leaving ATA gone forever. FOR&amp;ndash;EVER! FOR&amp;ndash;EVER! FOR&amp;ndash;EVER! Man, I love the Sandlot.</description>

                    <description>Hey everyone it's Michael, and welcome back to DC Nation Podcast! Your #1 source for all things related to Cartoon Network's DC Nation programming block (including Green Lantern: The Animated Series &amp;amp; Young Justice) as well as DC's Smallville: Season 11 comic book series. Because Adult Swim is technically part of the Cartoon Network and because Robot Chicken did a DC Comics related episode, I'm proud to present to you all Dan &amp;amp; my commentary on the "Robot Chicken: DC Comics Special"!!! Because we hadn't seen the episode before, and because it's a commentary, you may want to watch the episode along with us via DVR, or whatever format you use to watch Robot Chicken, so that you understand why we're laughing so hard when we do. But Smallville fans, don't turn your backs on us now, because coming off of our last interview with Season 11 scribe Bryan Q. Miller, my theories were correct about how Batman is able to beat Superman as we talk Detective, Chapter 4 (aka Smallville Season 11 chapter 16)! So, without any more distractions, let the chaos begin as we watch the first (and hopefully not the last) DC Comics Special of Robot Chicken! (and Smallville!)</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, when it comes to this podcast, an old saying from Westerns comes to mind about this town not being big enough for the two of us. Although, just in case you were wondering I'm not referring to Nico and I. I'm actually talking about the episodes of our favorite sci-fi/fantasy shows we reviewed for the week because they all seemed to feature a standoff between our favorite heroic characters and an arch nemesis. First off, on Alphas we had a literal battle of the minds between Dr. Rosen and the immortal big bad Stanton Parish, then with Warehouse 13, Artie and Brother Adrian's&amp;nbsp; conflict over the astrolabe began to heat up by taking another nasty turn and last but not least Doctor Who appeared to set up a Wild Western shootout with a cyborg that gave way to the Doctor battling a far greater nemesis himself as he was confronted by an alien Doctor, who was a skewed version of his David Tennant persona. In other words, to sum everything up this here podcast has got itself several good old-fashioned showdowns so draw your iPod from its holster and PRESS PLAY for some discussion slinging action!</description>

                    <description>Hey Everybody its Nico and Welcome to Across the Airwaves.&amp;nbsp; On this week's shorter, but still amazing episode of Across the Airwaves, Dan and I discuss the spectacular Doctor Who episode "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship," ... I know, Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. Join us&amp;nbsp;as we geek out about my favorite show on television, we discuss the dinosaurs, the Doctor has a gang, riding 'Tricey' to freedom, the big, frothy, nothing-earth-shatteringly-dangerous-will-happen-but-this-is-going-to-be-nuts type of episode that this was, and what I'd call the "Willy Wonka Doctor."&amp;nbsp; It may not have been perfect, but at least 'Dinosaurs on a Spaceship' delivered where it counts, with frivolous Jurassic Park sized fun for all.&amp;nbsp; So join us for a fun episode of Doctor Who on a shortened episode of Across the Airwaves and we will be back to full size next week.</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, as you already know there have been some pretty controversial DC superhero related content with the word &amp;ldquo;returns&amp;rdquo; in the title. There has been the Danny DeVito nose biting fright fest Batman Returns and the letdown to Superman fans everywhere Superman Returns. Although, unlike those movies us using the word &amp;ldquo;returns&amp;rdquo; in the title of this week's DC Nation Podcast does not indicate another disappointment as we were joined again by Smallville Season 11 Comic Book Writer Bryan Q. Miller.
Now you'd think Bryan could only handle one dose of our antics but believe it or not he actually asked us for more and even through in some antics of his own&amp;nbsp; while throwing in some entertaining off-topic tangents that I only thought Michael was capable of pulling off successfully. However, this episode wasn't all goofing around as we got down to Smallville business with Bryan revealing some alternate scenes he had for Season 11 Chapter 1 Guardian, giving background on the decision to bring Batman in the Smallville Universe and explaining how he is using the comic to fulfill a wish list of his own ideas for the Smallville TV Series that were left on the cutting room floor. In other words, if you like the behind the scenes content on the Smallville DVDs/Blu-rays or just in general, this DC Nation Podcast is totally worth the listen because Bryan gives you everything you want to know about the Smallville Season 11 Comics and more. In fact, this podcast was such a jolly good time, Bryan might even come back again after the next Smallville Chapter is complete but don't worry we will come up with a more creative title for that episode than Bryan Q. Miller Forever.
Again, I know we said it a bunch of times on the podcast but Bryan we can't thank you enough for coming back to do a second interview and DC Nationites if you enjoyed this episode please tweet complements to Bryan while replying to us @AcrossAirwaves because our good buddy deserves all the appreciation he can get from the DC Nation Podcast for taking the time out of his busy writing schedule to make this episode possible.</description>

An episode that left Nico and I completely blown away by its astonishing ability to keep blindsiding us with twists that we just did not see coming like this episode ending with the Doctor's greatest enemies asking who are you?&amp;nbsp; However, the fun we have on this podcast doesn't stop with Doctor Who as we get caught up on our reviews for the two other great sci-fi series that premiered this summer, Syfy Channel's Warehouse 13 and Alphas.</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites, it's Dan here bringing you another Comic Book Discussion podcast episode! And now there's probably a guy in the back of a room somewhere letting out a slow uncaring clap. In all honesty, this is a shorter episode because we feel you guys on that one as it's really time for new Green Lantern and Young Justice. However, please try to indulge us one more week since there's some new stuff planned for our next couple of episodes and you've got to be excited about this podcast's discussion on Smallville Season 11 as the longest running TV incarnation of Clark Kent/Superman comes face-to-face with Batman. In addition, the other comic books we talk about today, The Flash and Supergirl are some of the best to come out of The New 52.
Obviously, The Flash written by Francis Manapul was expected to be good but Supergirl was a surprise as it took the character of Kara in a whole new direction that felt as intense as a Bourne movie. However, what really makes these books great is that they personify their characters meaning that reading The Flash makes you feel like you are fighting criminals at the speed of light just like Barry Allen and the nonstop action featured in Supergirl makes your heart starts racing like your an innocent teenage girl who woke up on a strange world where it seems like you can't trust anybody.
Again, with these comics personifying their characters we tried to do the same with this podcast as we threw in musical transitions and more that represented Supergirl and The Flash. Heck, we even sped through this episode and that's a flash fact. On top of that, Michael would be a human Supergirl would believe to have questionable motives as the song he used at the end of the episode even personified one of Flash's Rogues good old Captain Boomerang who has yet to appear in The New 52. So Francis Manapul if you're listening, there's your next story arc but make sure credit goes to Dan and Michael the hosts of the DC Nation Podcast.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I've got some bad news for you, the sky is falling and no it's not in a Disney fairytale Chicken Little kind of way, I'm talking about giant spaceships, nuclear bombs, aliens enslaving children and every form of creepy crawley you can find in the book. However, with that thought in mind ATA Episode 87 can only go positive from here as my DC Nation Podcast cohost Michael J. Petty joins Nico and I to share the accounts of humanity's last line of defense the Second Mass Military Unit with our discussion on the second season of TNT's hit sci-fi TV Series Falling Skies. So with great pride and honor I present to you the sites and sounds of those same heroes acting as our defense against the alien threat told from the perspective of the Across The Airwaves Corps...</description>

                    <description>Hey guys and welcome back to DC Nation! Well, you've been waiting for this episode since summer started (well, since the New 52 started... but yeah...) and now we're finally going to deliver! On our "Super-Soap Box" episode, Dan and I get on our mics and go right at it! It being Grant Morrison. Morrison is personally responsible for destroying both Batman &amp;amp; X-Men comics of the last decade (which, both have (for the most part) been, thankfully, un-done by various means) and is now working on Superman (in Action Comics). I had high hopes for this run, mainly because of how good All-Star Superman is (which he also wrote), however, as Dan and I talk about, this run on Action makes no sense at all. But Morrison isn't all we talk about! We also discuss Dan Jurgens run on the current Superman book as well as our high hopes for Scott Lobdell's run, coming this fall. But, since we didn't want to leave you on a sour note, and it did fit into our "Superman" theme, we also cover the Smallville: Season 11 episode "Detective" in Part 2 (which is technically Chapter 14) written by our good friend Bryan Q. Miller (who will be back with us on Week 26 I might add)! So, without any more delay, enjoy Dan and I rant about Grant Morrison, Superman history, Dan Jurgens, comic book artists, Superman/Lois Lane/Wonder Woman love triangle, and of course Smallville!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, extreme ways are back again for Across the Airwaves as Nico and I reprise our hosting duties to kick off our third season featuring more celebrity interviews, new podcast spinoffs and the addition of two new cohosts (fingers crossed) with a episode on SyFy Channel's Warehouse 13 and Alphas. In fact, within the worlds of these shows extreme ways have taken us to places we've never known as Artie used an dangerous artifact to restore the warehouse despite the risk of unleashing an evil upon the world and Dr. Rosen announced the existence of Alphas to the public. As you can imagine, this means that our discussion on this episode is all about the debate on if Rosen and Artie's epic decisions will save the world or cause it to fall apart. However that's not without our favorite Warehouse Agents&amp;nbsp; and Alpha Team Members having to say something about it especially when Gary Bell is on the case. I know it's been a while but with Gary around you've got to remember to respect the badge by accepting our invitation to join us as we delve right into the adventurous realms of Warehouse 13 and Alphas, two programs worthy of the title Powerful Mondays.</description>

                    <description>Hello, ATA Listeners! It's Dan here and with us still trying to get our bearings straight after returning from vacation, we decided to make this episode simple by just making it a discussion on The New 52 Justice League Comics brought together by Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and an All-Star team of additional artists. Now normally we would pair this discussion with a review on the next installment of Smallville Season 11 but since the next chapter Detective is not going to be released until this Friday, we decided to stick with giving you our thoughts on Justice League as well as the back story involving the new origins of Shazam beginning in Issue #7.
However, more Smallville is not the only thing for you to look forward to as a comment from long time podcast listener Jason A. reveals that an ATA Episode 86 is in the making, which is set to review new episodes of Warehouse 13 and Alphas currently airing Monday nights on SyFy. Also as you may have noticed ads have been added to the ATA website and we ask that you please bear with these sponsors because we need their support to keep producing podcast episodes.</description>

Hey guys, and welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast's coverage on this years San Diego Comic Con. Because we didn't get to finish our coverage of DC Comics at the Con this year, we split it into two episodes (or weeks). Week 20 was all about the comics aspect of DC Entertainment, and now Week 21 (the one you are currently downloading and reading the description of...) will talk more about DC's media, including everything DC Nation (no, not our podcast, the&amp;nbsp;actual&amp;nbsp;Cartoon Network programming block!) including the second halfs of the current seasons of Green Lantern and Young Justice, the upcoming shows for this block including the highly anticipated Beware the Batman as well as the return of the Teen Titans to Cartoon Network in Teen Titans Go!, and of course the next wave of DC Nation Shorts coming up. But that's not all Dan and I talk about on this episode, we also talk about the most highly anticipated film of 2013 and it's panel featuring director Zack Snyder and lead actor Henry Cavill, yes, you guessed it, Superman's return to the big screen: Man of Steel! We talk the teaser trailer shown in front of The Dark Knight Rises (now on Youtube as well), the Comic Con footage, and everything Snyder &amp;amp; Cavil said about the movie. But we couldn't leave you with just one discussion on Superman, we also had to throw in the final moments of the Smallville Season 11 premiere arc entitled "Guardian" (by our friend Bryan Q. Miller) and our thoughts on what's in store for the Smallville Universe with our discussion on Chapter 12. All this and more on Week 21 of&amp;nbsp;DC Nation!</description>

                    <description>Hello everyone and welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast! We're sorry it took so long for this episode to get out to you, but unfortunately, Dan was at Summer Camp all of last week, so he couldn't really put it out.&amp;nbsp;Regardless, we're back, and this time we are covering DC Entertainment's news at Comic Con 2012! We cover the Batman: Beyond the Court of Owls panel, the DC - All Access Now panel, the Superman, Justice League/Green Lantern panels, and the New 52 panel as well. There is a lot of news coming out of Comic Con this year and a lot to discuss, hence this being a long episode.&amp;nbsp;In-fact, this episode was actually split into two parts as the&amp;nbsp;recording&amp;nbsp;was getting way to long. So our coverage of DC Nation at SDCC and the Man of Steel panel are going to take place on our next episode (Week 21) instead. But don't worry Smallville fans, we haven't let you down so far and we won't let you down today as we cover the Season 11 premiere "Guardian" with the 11th Chapter of this amazing saga featuring a showdown between Superman and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Cyborg-Superman, and a shocking reveal at what may come next for our dear Smallville Universe. All this and more on Week 20 of DC Nation!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I was going to come up with something really eloquent and profound for this post to hype one of the biggest events of the year, San Diego Comic Con 2012. However, with all of the delays that have been going on with the release of our podcast episodes from computer issues to me being on vacation, I'm going to keep this short and sweet by saying join us as we discuss all of the news headlines that came out of Comic Con 2012 and the panels where the people behind our favorite Live-Action TV shows (Community, The Big Bang Theory, Psych, Once upon a Time, Person of Interest, Fringe, Supernatural and Doctor Who) give a sneak peek at their upcoming new seasons.</description>

                    <description>Hey everyone, and welcome back to Across the Airwaves' classic spin-off podcast entitled "Retro Reviews". Today we speak to you all with very heavy hearts as Woo and I return from our slumber to talk about the theater shooting that took place at The Dark Knight Rises midnight screening in&amp;nbsp;Aurora, Colorado. First of all, we'd like to send our deepest sympathies from here at ATA towards the victims and the families of the victims during this terrible time. Secondly, this even really disturbed Woo and I, and we really get emotional and angry in this podcast. I do encourage you to listen to it, because we do get light-hearted again while talking about The Dark Knight Rises, Arrow &amp;amp; Supernatural at SDCC, and the Man of Steel trailer in detail. And while we do briefly discuss those last three things, the main event of this podcast is our long discussion on this event, as well as our Man of Steel trailer that is suppose to give us hope. If you are afraid to go see TDKR, or any movie at all, I'd&amp;nbsp;encourage&amp;nbsp;you to rise above your fear, doubts, and anger to do it. Not only is it one of the greatest films of the year, but it's also the most epic end to a trilogy that I have ever seen (well, maybe it ties with Return of the King &amp;amp; Return of the Jedi...). The whole point of The Dark Knight Rises and the Dark Knight Trilogy in general is overcoming fear to be better than we are. This is what I encourage all of you to do. Thank you, and enjoy our tribute to the families and victims of this terrible&amp;nbsp;tragedy.</description>

                    <description>Hello loyal DC Comics fans, Atlantians, Kryptonians, cyborgs, Geoff Johns fans, and DC Nation listeners and welcome back! This week on ATA's very own DC Nation Podcast, Dan and I cover the most&amp;nbsp;controversial&amp;nbsp;superhero in pretty much all of comic book history, this character is none other than Orin/Arthur "A.C." Curry aka AQUAMAN! Now, Aquaman (created by Paul Norris), has had one of the most convoluted backgrounds in all of comic book history (others with that title include Hawkman, Jean Grey, Ben&amp;nbsp;Reilly, and Power Girl) but now with DC's New 52 relaunch, Geoff Johns has fixed all the problems we've had with Aquaman over the past 75 years, in just ONE ISSUE!!! That's right, so far issues 1-10 of this new series are out, and we cover all of them, but first, we start out with a little bit of background on "mankind's truest friend" followed by our discussion on the first story line, "The Trench". After that we quickly move onto the better of the two story arcs (witch, by the way, is still going on) "The Others" featuring my all-time worst fear: BLACK MANTA!!! But Aquaman isn't all we talk about this week on DC Nation, we also talk about Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville Season 11 with part 10 of "Guardian", kicking off the final act of the premiere! We discuss Superman maybe redeeming Superman IV, Lex Luthor's latest "butt kicked" moment, and the birth of Smallville's Cyborg Superman! All this and more on this underwater episode of the&amp;nbsp;DC Nation Podcast!</description>

                    <description>Hello fellow Gothamites, Nolanites, and Bat-Fans and welcome back to Across the Airwaves! This is of course the Road to TDKR Podcast Series of commentaries on the Bat-Films leading up to The Dark Knight Rises. HOWEVER, this time on Road to TDKR, your favorite host Dan Schmidt &amp;amp; I will be commentating on one of the most important films in movie, super hero, and comic book history. That film, of course, is The Dark Knight. As the longest and final film in this series of commentaries, Dan &amp;amp; I make a very special effort to not just enjoy the movie, but really dissect the most important elements of it. The Joker. The rise and fall of Harvey "Two-Face" Dent. The effect Rachel's death had on the characters. The importance of the Batman. Our theory on Heath Ledger's death and that his portrayal of the Joker may have driven him to madness. And our theories on how the events of this film will carry on over into The Dark Knight Rises. &amp;nbsp;We dedicate this commentary to Heath Ledger, Conway Wickliffe,&amp;nbsp;Jerry Robinson, and Christopher Nolan himself.</description>

                    <description>Hey gang, and welcome back to the DC Nation Podcast, brought to you by the Across the Airwaves Network! As you know, last week on the podcast, we interviewed Green Lantern: The Animated Series producer Giancarlo Volpe, &amp;nbsp;what most of you don't know, is that the next day, we recorded this episode for you as well! Unfortunately, due to scheduling conflicts, we couldn't get it out to you all until now, but hey, no one's perfect! So on this weeks DC Nation Podcast, as Green Lantern &amp;amp; Young Justice aren't back from hiatus and reruns, Dan and I decided to keep going with our "Summer of DC" thing that we did on Week 16 with the Batman books and continue on with the Batman Beyond Unlimited comic! Now, this book is different than most. 3 digital chapters of Batman Beyond, Justice League Beyond (or Justice League Unlimited), and Superman Beyond are released each month, and when it comes time for the print, they combine and form the BBU comic! Pretty neat, huh? So, Dan and I start with Batman Beyond: Hush, then Batman Beyond (2011 series), and then go into the current series, then Superman Beyond, and then the JLU book. It's a great, long, and fun discussion and if you're a fan of the DC Animated Universe and want to know what happens before&amp;nbsp;Epilogue, then you've come to the right place! But don't be alarmed my friends, since we didn't get to cover Smallville: Season 11 "Guardian" Part 9 yet, we cover that too (for about 20 minutes or so...)!!! Dan talks about Lex's "beat-up" moment of the week and&amp;nbsp;I think I have a good theory on who the person in the Queen Industries ship is... All this in the DC Nation Podcast Week 18!!!</description>

                    <description>Hello fellow Green Lantern Corps members, Benders, comic fans, and ATA followers and welcome back! On this special episode of Across the Airwaves' DC Nation Podcast, Dan and I interview one of the&amp;nbsp;show-runners&amp;nbsp;of one of our favorite shows to cover here on the ATA Network entitled, Green Lantern: The Animated Series! As you all know, we have covered every episode of this show on our DC Nation Podcast from Week 1 (aka ATA Episode 74) to Week 13 until the show took it's summer hiatus. But now, we have scored an interview with a producer of this show who has worked on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and, of course, Green Lantern: TAS, his name is Giancarlo Volpe! Giancarlo graciously (like Smallville: Season 11 writer Bryan Q. Miller did months ago) agreed to an interview and we didn't even have to force him at gunpoint! In this interview, we talk about the "behind-the-scenes" of Green Lantern, the creation of Aya and Razer (and their romance...), how Gi got his job on GL: TAS, how and why the Interceptor was created, why we don't like when some super heroes have vehicles, translation from comics to television, and more on this special DC Nation Podcast One-Shot! Also, a shout out to Steve Quayle for letting me use his office to record this interview as the connection at my place was down. Thanks Steve!</description>

                    <description>Howdy DC Nationers, it's Summer and we're going to use Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Young Justice Invasion being on hiatus as an excuse to take it easy because frankly everyone here at ATA has been working really hard. However, that does not mean we are going to stop providing you with podcasts we are just going to be taking a different approach with our episodes as our reviews on the digital issues of Smallville Season 11 will be combined with a series of discussions on DC's The New 52 Comic Books until our favorite DC Nation Shows return.
Now that you know the lowdown&amp;nbsp; for the next couple weeks. This particular episode is called Podcast of the Owls since we are beginning our New 52 discussions on the Batman related books, particularly their connection to the highly acclaimed Court/Night of the Owls crossover event, which concluded with a reveal that may change the dynamic of the Bat Family forever! On that note, in going along with the laid-back nature of summer, this section is going to be a mostly unedited conversation between Michael and I discussing what we like about the current Batman Comics with a few sound effects for entertainment and chapter markers to help you follow our little chat. So with that get out your stack of comics and enjoy the show because we have a fun one here for your listening pleasure.</description>

                    <description>Hey guys, welcome back! In case you don't know, you're listening to the "Road to The Dark Knight Rises" commentary series brought to you by Across the Airwaves! This time, Dan and Michael watch the animated "bridge" in between Begins and TDK entitled "Batman: Gotham Knight". The reason we decided to cover Gotham Knight was because it really does get into Batman's head and sets up his position in TDK (which will be our next and final commentary for Road to TDKR) as well as the fact that Batman is voiced by the only "true" Batman in our opinion, Kevin Conroy! Join Dan and I in watching Batman: Gotham Knight consisting of 6 chapters, by 6 different writers, but it's one over-arcing story. So, thanks for taking the last minute to read this and now put in your Gotham Knight DVD/Blu-Ray, turn on your commentary, and strap in, because we're taking this up to 11!</description>

It's Dan here, bringing you our Week 15 episode entitled Comeback because this week's Young Justice Invasion episode &amp;ldquo;Depths&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; featured the seeds being planted for Superboy and Miss Martian to come back to their romantic relationship and Smallville Season 11 Guardian Chapter 7 dealt with Clark as Superman making a comeback towards Lex Luthor for sabotaging his own space shuttle launch.&amp;nbsp; In addition, we here at ATA hope that with Green Lantern as well as Young Justice on hiatus you will&amp;nbsp; come back for more of our ATA DC Nation podcasts as we're going to continue reviewing the Smallville Season 11 Digital Comics and begin discussions on DC's The New 52 comic books until the animated shows return with new episodes. By the way, before I forget to mention it, this ATA DC Nation podcast also features discussions on the Superhero Shorts: DC Nation Mythbusters Kid Flash's Dodging, Sword of the Atom Part 2 and The New Teen Titans in Taped before a Live Studio Audience.</description>

                    <description>The&amp;nbsp;UNEDITED, EXPLICIT, ROUGH-CUT&amp;nbsp;Retro Reviews Season 1 finale&amp;nbsp;is here with our most highly anticipated episode of the season on our "Top 5 Favorite Smallville Episodes". No exceptions, no limitations, only what you think are your favorite episodes of the series. This episode includes co-hosts&amp;nbsp;Michael J. Petty &amp;amp; Woo S. Kim&amp;nbsp;joined by &amp;nbsp;the ATA-god&amp;nbsp;Dan Schmidt, and our resident&amp;nbsp;Smallville/Young Justice&amp;nbsp;fan-girl&amp;nbsp;Alisa Lea Gossage! Before the main event, however, we do talk about&amp;nbsp;Hans Zimmer&amp;nbsp;(NOT James Newton Howard) composing&amp;nbsp;Man of Steel,&amp;nbsp;Superman vs The Elite&amp;nbsp;(why you should watch it according to Michael),&amp;nbsp;Batman&amp;nbsp;coming to Smallville in&amp;nbsp;11x2 "Detective", and why&amp;nbsp;Superman&amp;nbsp;is always given a significant chin in DC Animation. So on that final note, be warned that this is a 2 and a half hour long episode, that we talk in depth about the episodes we chose, and that the last few episodes we mention were rushed because we were running out of time.&amp;nbsp;Special thanks&amp;nbsp;to Dan for allowing&amp;nbsp;Retro Reviews, Alisa for listening, Woo for being my co-host this year, and to&amp;nbsp;Nico, James, and Josh&amp;nbsp;for being patient with being on the show (which will happen for sure next season!). So, until next time guys, we'll catch you on the&amp;nbsp;Airwaves!</description>

                    <description>Hello my friends and welcome back to ATA's very own spin-off hosted by myself (Michael J. Petty) and my partner-in-crime Woo S. Kim, this is the Retro Reviews podcast!!! This week on R&amp;amp;R, Woo and I thought it would be "fun" to talk about one of the most hated and&amp;nbsp;criticized&amp;nbsp;parts of Smallville as a whole... Clana. But don't worry female listeners, your perspective is here as well in the form of ATA loyalist and frequent guest-star on our Smallville shows, Alisa Lea!!! That's right, Woo, Lis, and I talk Clana (and Lana in general) to death. Why did we hate it? Why did it go on for so long? How could it have been better? All these questions and more are answered on the latest episode of (Smallville) Retro Reviews!!!</description>

                    <description>Hello DC Nationites!&amp;nbsp; It's Dan here, Week 14 of our DC Nation Section is entitled Mr. Speed and Family because this week's Young Justice Invasion episode &amp;ldquo;Bloodlines&amp;rdquo; was all about the DC Universe's very own Mr. Speed, The Flash along with his extended family including his grandson Bart Allen better known as Impulse and later on Kid Flash in the current comic books. Also with our excitement wanting us to take a cosmic treadmill or flash forward to July 20th we took the time left open on this podcast due to Green Lantern: The Animated Series and Smallville Season 11 being on hiatus to discuss the footage from The Dark Knight Rises that was shown at the MTV Movie Awards. In addition, the discussion on Young Justice and the upcoming Christopher Nolan Batman Film was rounded out with our thoughts on the DC Nation Shorts, Who's Who in the DC Nation: The Flash, Sword of the Atom Part 2 and The New Teen Titans in Cyborg the Lifeguard.</description>

                    <description>Hi everyone, and welcome to the long awaited and anticipated event of ATA's Summer schedule: Road to The Dark Knight Rises (or "Road to TDKR" for short). I'd like to thank you all for being patient about the release of this series and this commentary in particular. For our first of three commentaries, Dan and I discuss and commentate on the Christopher Nolan film, Batman Begins, while watching the film (hence commentary)! We talk a lot about Ras Al Ghoul, Bruce's journey to becoming Batman, and how this movie will connect (and how it has forshadowed) to the most anticipated film of this summer, The Dark Knight Rises. So without furtur adu, I'm proud to present to you, Batman Begins, ATA style!</description>

                    <description>What's up DC Nationers, on Week 13 of our podcast, it's ladies night and the feelings right because if it wasn't for the many women in Hal Jordan's Life such as Carol Ferris, Aya the robot girl and the Star Sapphires, the little blue Smurfs on Oa would have gone bye-bye at the end of the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode &amp;ldquo;Homecoming&amp;rdquo;. But the fun with the ladies didn't stop there as Nightwing sent just the mighty heroines of the team on a mission in the Young Justice Invasion episode &amp;ldquo;Beneath&amp;rdquo; and we got a Super Best Friends Forever Short where the extremely perky Batgirl gave the girl powered group its name. Then we moved away from the ladies a bit as we covered the first short in the Sword of the Atom series, although it took the original superhero comic book heroine, to prove you can't put a good woman down as Smallville Season 11 Guardian Chapter 6 featured Lois Lane reminding Clark why the world needs Superman when he questions if astronaut Adam Sandler, I mean Hank Henshaw would make a better hero.</description>

                    <description>Hello Superhero Animation Fans, it's Dan here with the Week 12 edition of ATA DC Nation where we learned the answer to that burning question we've had on our minds since Young Justice took a five-year time jump, where in the world is Artemis Crock? And just how did we get this answer do you ask?&amp;nbsp; Well, it was through our reviews on the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode &amp;ldquo;Invasion&amp;rdquo; and the Young Justice Invasion episode &amp;ldquo;Salvage&amp;rdquo;. Also with this week's ATA DC Nation, we discussed three new DC Nation Shorts, delved through the digital pages of Smallville Season 11: Guardian Chapter 5 and to keep you in suspense recorded a special opening to this podcast that I think you're all going to enjoy or at least give you a big laugh. Again, as you've probably noticed with this podcast, Michael comes up with these things and I just end up going for the ride, even if it ends in a fiery blaze of glory. So enjoy... I guess LOL!</description>

                    <description>&amp;nbsp;
Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is called &amp;ldquo;Adrenaline&amp;rdquo; because this title and the song by Gavin Rossdale is the best way to describe our favorite Season Finale of the year, the Person of Interest episode &amp;ldquo;Firewall&amp;rdquo;, which Nico hailed as the best hour on television next to Game of Thrones for simply maintaining its regular format while providing us with action worthy of a Finale. However, with this also being Across The Airwaves' Finale as we head into a short Summer hiatus we had some intense adrenaline filled action to deal with on our own.
For the most part, this episode started out calm like Person of Interest with our review on the Finale for Once upon a Time and our favorite comedic moments from Modern Family but then the drama amped up with our reviews on the Finales for Bones, Supernatural and the whopping three episodes that rounded out Community's finale. Don't get me wrong, even though we were apprehensive about the concept at first, Nico and I really loved all three episodes of Community believing they fit together really well in a writer's triumph for Dan Harmon. But alas, this victory was bittersweet as word has come out that Dan Harmon has been replaced as Showrunner making us face the possibility Community will never be the same.
In addition, this issue of being fearful for the future flooded into our discussions on Bones and Supernatural as both Finales left us disappointed. Again, the future looks a little brighter for Supernatural as Sera Gamble the Showrunner who diminished the show's quality during Season Six is now gone. Although, Bones on the other hand, there Finale could have been the best episode of the series, if it wasn't marred by the second half of this season jumping the shark, leaving the question on if we are going to continue covering Bones in the Fall as our ATA Season Finale cliffhanger.
By the way with our favorite live-action shows now on hiatus, we are going to be taking a two-week hiatus to further develop the Across The Airwaves Website and plan out our summer programming but Michael&amp;rsquo;s show ATA Retro Reviews will be continuing as well as DC Nation until those cartoon series go on hiatus. Also keep an eye out for our return episode featuring our favorite comedic moments from the Modern Family Season Finale and a discussion on&amp;nbsp; Nickelodeon's new Avatar Series, The Legend of Korra.</description>

                    <description>On this edition of ATA's DC Nation Section, we investigate what Black Manta is for, which is scaring Michael as he faces his worst nightmare, the knowledge that there is now not just one but two Black Mantas out there terrorizing the high seas and possibly the swimming pool in my infamous cohost's backyard.&amp;nbsp; (Good luck sleeping tonight Michael, mmmwahahahahahaha!) Anyway, the identity of this second Black Manta was a shocker to all of us here on ATA, so join us as we discuss this unbelievable revelation that occurred during this week's Young Justice Invasion entitled &amp;ldquo;Alienated&amp;rdquo; and review the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode &amp;ldquo;Flight Club&amp;ldquo;. Also as always we talk about the week's new DC Nation and resume our conversations on the Smallville Season 11 Comic Books with the release of Guardian Chapter 4. In addition, we round everything out for this episode with Michael sharing some news about upcoming Young Justice and Green Lantern: The Animated Series DVD releases, more insight on the Young Justice Legacy Videogame and the exciting announcement that The CW has picked up Arrow for the Fall 2012 TV Season.</description>

                    <description>On this week's ATA DC Nation, our discussion seemed to teach us the hard way, breaking up is hard to do as Ganthet was banished by The Guardians in the Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode &amp;ldquo;Regime Change&amp;rdquo; and the Young Justice Invasion episode &amp;ldquo;Earthlings&amp;rdquo; answered the burning question that has sent the Internet buzzing of why Miss Martian and Superboy broke up. Shockingly, this topic almost caused a breakup between Michael and myself as fellow&amp;nbsp; podcast hosts as we disagreed on Superboy's reasoning for causing the breakup with Megan. Michael thought it was because of Superboy's inability to age and I thought it was because Connor didn't like how Megan was just going around lobotomizing people without thinking of the consequences but then there was BLACK MANTA!!!&amp;nbsp; Again, Black Manta really wasn't important to this episode except for appearing in the Animal Man Short and he for sure as nothing to do with breakups but I had to mention the Aquaman villain anyway since it's hilarious how Michael is afraid of him. On that note, if you enjoyed this episode of ATA's DC Nation be sure to show your support for our show by posting the hashtag #blackmanta on our ATA Twitter Page @AcrossAirwaves, Google Plus Page and Michael's personal Twitter @MJPetty7.</description>

                    <description>Hi ATA Listeners, first off apologies about the delay in the release of this podcast, I had a nasty case of food poisoning that put me out of commission for a few days. Anyway, due to things being somewhat behind schedule, I'm going to make my synopsis for this episode short and sweet by saying that this week's set of reviews all seemed to deal with the characters on our favorite shows such as Once upon a Time, Bones, Castle, Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural&amp;nbsp; working out some sort of issue with their real or surrogate families. Even the sitcoms dealt with family drama as Howard on The Big Bang Theory had to push back his wedding for going into space, Modern Family obviously dealt with a family issue and on Community, the family of students at Greendale had to say goodbye to one of their own.</description>

                    <description>Hey gang, and welcome back to the one show on the ATA Network that includes both Mr. Thor-voice AND Wooton Kim! On this highly anticipated episode of Retro Reviews, Woo and I cover one of the greatest franchises in all of television, cartoons, and the entertainment industry: SCOOBY-DOO! In this episode, after brief Smallville, Chuck, and Supernatural discussion, we talk about Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?, The New Scooby-Doo Movies, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, the two (good) Scooby-Doo films, Scooby-Doo and The Reluctant Werewolf, Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, and Shaggy! I also try really hard to convince Woo to watch the current Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated series on Cartoon Network (send him a tweet to help me out!!!!) But don't think that we only talk about our favorite animated pooch, Woo and I also have an in-depth discussion about the Cartoon Network and cartoons/children's television of today! That is almost worth listening to us for 2 hours! So, strap into the Mystery Machine, grab a hand-full of Scooby-Snacks, and scream for Sha'ggy, because this will be one big mystery, that only we can solve!</description>

                    <description>&amp;nbsp;
On this week's ATA episode, Nico and I are walking on sunshine because it's time to feel good about outstanding television coming our way as some of the shows we review began ramping up towards their Season Finales with&amp;nbsp; the characters of Fringe having to say goodbye to their doppelg&amp;auml;ngers on the other side, Person of Interest dealing with the return of Reese's partner who was assumed to be dead and Supernatural making Nico fall in love with his crush, Felicia Day all over again. However With the writers of these shows basking in the sunlight of their ideas coming together into an exciting conclusion to the season, there are others who seem to have a black rain cloud overhead since Once upon a Time's promise to give us answers on the identity of August W. Booth ended up just being a wild goose chase and Bones just doesn't seem to be the same show following its return from hiatus. Again, there is hope that the skies will clear for Once upon a Time based on the show only being in its first season but Bones seems to have met the perfect storm with it continuing to frustrate us more so every week.
On the other hand, even the sitcoms got on board with ramping things up towards their Season Finales as Big Bang Theory seems to be progressing towards a wedding and Community went ahead to kill off a reoccurring character. Yeah, I know it's kind of morbid to leave a description for an episode entitled Walking on Sunshine with a theme like death but look at the bright side at least Community is keeping things interesting enough to stay on the air.</description>

                    <description>On this week's ATA DC Nation section our discussion is all about the heroes of the DC Universe facing the consequences of what they've done under the influence of mind control or super villainy as this week's Green Lantern The Animated Series &amp;ldquo;Fear Itself&amp;rdquo; episode dealt with Kilowog turning on Hal and this week's Young Justice entitled&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Auld Acquaintance&amp;rdquo; had a Starro controlled Justice League turn on Aqualad and his team.&amp;nbsp; Even the heroes in this week's shorts had to face the results of their actions as Plastic Man turned on the TV itself and Robin in the course of defeating Mad Mod took The New Teen Titans to the future. Meanwhile in the Smallville Season 11 department,&amp;nbsp; things were good between Clark and Oliver as they performed a solid superhero team up but Chloe realized she might be making a mistake on the decision to move away from the Watchtower in Metropolis as a mysterious spacecraft, which Michael and I share a few crackpot theories about in this episode heads towards Earth.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, let's do the time warp again as this week's slate of reviews took us from past, present, future and beyond in a way that would make the Doctor and the TARDIS proud. Basically, our time warp started out taking us to the past where and this week's Bones made us wish for better days when the show's &amp;nbsp;writing was stronger and Castle caused us to relieve the time were Firefly was on the air with a reunion between Nathan Filion and Adam Baldwin. Then Phil trying to give his daughter the best day ever on Modern Family caused us to take a quick stop in the present followed by us going a little bit of everywhere as this week's Community intelligently spoofed on Doctor Who. From here it was welcome to the future as this week's episodes of Fringe and Legend of Korra dealt with the descendents of heroic characters that we love trying to instill their parent's visions upon worlds threatened by evil. And lastly we round out our exploration of space and time in the great beyond as Supernatural gave us a story about Bobby being a ghost in training. So with that pull out your TARDIS key and unlock the sounds of this podcast because it contains an adventure that makes your iPod look bigger on the inside.&amp;nbsp;</description>

                    <description>This weeks DC Nation episode is called traitors for a few reasons. 1. Because Razor betrays Hal, Kilowa g, and Aya to go and kill&amp;nbsp;Atrocitus in Green Lantern. 2. Because Red Arrow is revealed to be the mole in Young Justice. and 3. Because of a shocking conclusion to the latest episode of Smallville Season 11. So, are you ready for some crackpot theories on upcoming Green Lantern and Smallville episodes? Thought so! Are you ready for Dan's thoughts on the (already aired) Young Justice finale? Bout time! And are you ready for some good discussion on the latest DC Nation Shorts? Damn straight! Alright, so, without anymore stalling, Week 7 of DC Nation!!!</description>

                    <description>Hey guys, welcome back to a little town called Randomville. Population: US! (us not U.S. as in A) Anyway, on that note, Woo and I had nothing in particular to talk about on a Saturday night, so we decided to just do a Geek Out Loud style podcast and go wherever the airwaves take us (see what I did there?). And guess what?.... IT WORKED!!! We talk about a bunch of things, like Smallville, Chuck, Glee (ugh!), Smallville Season 11, theories about the Ghost-Tess, cancelled shows, Supernatural, and more! Also, trying to convince Woo to do a Scooby-Doo themed episode like our Power Rangers one, so if anyone wants that, PLEASE message him @WSK9002 on twitter or buy ANY other means&amp;nbsp;necessary... Good luck!</description>

If you're here for the first time, check out our commentaries on Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor! They're all just as fun. However, in my honest opinion, I think that our commentary about Marvel's First Avenger (see what I did there?) is our best one yet. So, without&amp;nbsp;further&amp;nbsp;adu, I am proud to present ATA's finale Road to The Avengers commentary on CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER!</description>

                    <description>Earth. Fire. Air. Water. When this podcast was in its infancy we discussed the story of how Avatar Aang and his friends heroically ended the Hundred Year War.&amp;nbsp; Talking about the achievement of Executive Producers Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko transforming the Television Animation Industry by&amp;nbsp; combining the styles of Anime and American cartoons into a show where children and adults from all over the world, could enjoy together an epic tale of peace and harmony. They named this great Nickelodeon series Avatar: The Last Airbender. During their time on the air, the adventures of Avatar Aang accomplished many remarkable things. But sadly, after an outstanding series finale and a god-awful live-action movie adaptation his time in this world came to an end. Then like with all strong entertainment franchises, the cycle of the Avatar, began anew." And with that I'm proud to present Across the Airwaves Episode 79 as one of your first chances to meet the new Avatar, Korra as we add Nickelodeon's new series The Legend of Korra to our slate of reviews with our discussion on the highly anticipated one hour World Premiere.
Although, that's not all you are going to get with this podcast episode as Nico gives a&amp;nbsp; rant about how Bones seems to be losing its touch and I discuss how the shocking cliffhanger at the end of the Psych Season Finale might change the character&amp;nbsp; of Shawn Spencer forever. Oh and did I mention that we've got a bunch of crackpot theories that came out of our discussion on this week's Fringe episode? Also as always we cover our favorite sitcoms, with Nico and I sharing our favorite comedic moments on this week's Modern Family and Community.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, with this week's episode I'm proud to say that it contained some great emotional insight from Nico and I as we reviewed this week in television. However, this came at a price as Nico had to suffer through what he thought was a bad Monday night of television based on Castle acting completely out of character of the most recent episode and the birth of Bones' baby being done in a way that made the show a shadow of its once great former self. Again, I attributed these issues to Castle gearing up for an epic season finale and Bones recovering from an insanely long hiatus but from Nico's status he was just not happy, which is fine because as our good friend Bryan Q. Miller says everyone is entitled to their own opinion on a piece of creative work. In fact,&amp;nbsp; Nico's rant as we'll call it was all in good fun as we both got a good laugh after it was all over with on this actual episode but that does not mean his points didn't have merit behind them.&amp;nbsp; Plus, compared to Monday, the rest of the week in television went much better for Nico as you will hear in our reviews on&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Once upon a Time, Psych, Person of Interest and Fringe as well as our favorite comedic moments from this week's episodes of Breaking In, Big Bang Theory and Community.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's episode we are riding the storm out as we wait for the fallout caused by all the emotion, drama and surprises leading our favorite shows to their season finales. On one side of the spectrum we have Castle and Person of Interest dealing with emotional differences between lead characters and on the other side we've got Once upon a Time, Fringe and Supernatural widening their overarching stories to a whole new perspective&amp;nbsp; where a character on one of these shows was brought back in a way that we thought was unimaginable. Heck, Community even got in on the storm leading up to season finales as it set up a pillow versus blanket Fort fight between Troy and Abed. As for Breaking In, The Big Bang Theory and Psych, I would classify them as the eye of the storm since they were much calmer on the conflicts this week compared to our other favorites but their episodes were still worth talking about as they covered topics in geekdom Nico and I love like Star Trek and Indiana Jones. So now that we've got the lowdown on this podcast out of the way, it's time to get in your homes and bat down the hatches because&amp;nbsp; it's the time of year again for season finales meaning only Across The Airwaves can guide you through the storm.</description>

                    <description>Hello, and welcome back to Across the Airwaves! For those of you who don't know or maybe have just forgot, currently on ATA, creator/producer/host Dan Schmidt and I (Michael J. Petty) are going through each individual "Pre-Avengers" Marvel movie, leading up to May 4th world premiere of "The Avengers", in the form of commentaries (you know, those things on the Special Features that no one ever clicks on)! We have already commentated on Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk and are now bringing you Iron Man 2! Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger will be on their way, but for now, take a break on a rainy afternoon (actually, any afternoon would be just fine, even morning works!), put in your DVD/Blu-Ray disc of Iron Man 2, and watch it, with us taking to you in your ear... Enjoy!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode features reviews of our favorite shows where one of the main characters was in need of some love. Once upon a Time gave us a story where Snow White&amp;nbsp; in need of a cure to a potion that made her incapable of expressing love, Castle as always was chasing after Beckett,&amp;nbsp; Breaking In's Cam was in need of a grand romantic gesture to hook up with Melanie and in the Fringeverse Olivia was willing to sacrifice her memories for Peter to be in love with her.
However, romantic love wasn't the only thing some characters were looking for as we also got some buddy love as Dean reuniting with Cass allowed them to work out their differences on this week's Supernatural and Psych's Shawn and Gus proved that they can maintain their lifelong best friend chemistry&amp;nbsp; even though Shawn having his appendix removed delegated him to solving the mystery through an iPad. Plus, on top of that we got some really fun romance between Lassie and his jailbird girlfriend Marlowe. Then again, the only show that might not necessarily fit the theme of this ATA Episode is Community but I guess Jeff's ego got some love as he impersonated Ryan Seacrest or maybe Troy gave Abed some much needed love as he tried to help him with his addiction of hiring celebrity impersonators. Anyway, to find out which one&amp;nbsp; of these characters&amp;nbsp; got the love that they needed or are still in search of it, tune into this podcast episode affectionately named after the popular Beatles song All You Need Is Love.</description>

                    <description>Hey guys, and welcome back to DC Nation! This week on ATA's DC Nation review, Dan and I talk about the 3rd episode of Green Lantern: The Animated Series entitled "Razor's Edge" and the 21st episode of Young Justice entitled "Images". We also talk about this weeks DC Nation Shorts, including the Batmobile feature, the Shazamwich! (in which I will memorize for the next episode), and the new Super Best Friends Forever short. There was a lot of discussion on this episode about a new DC Animated Universe (in which, we believe, Green Lantern takes place), DC Nation's upcoming series for November: Beware the Batman, White Martians, Young Justice Invasion, moles, Beast Boy, and my "Superfriends announcer voice"! We have also added a new section to our DC Nation reviews entitled "A Child's Perspective". In this section, we see DC Nation in the eyes of a 7 (soon to be 8 ) year-old! All this and more on the latest DC Nation!</description>

                    <description>Hi everyone, and welcome to Across the Airwaves. For those of you long time fans, and those who have tuned in for this interview, we would like to thank you in advance for viewing our little podcast. A few weeks ago, I (Michael J. Petty) had sent a tweet to DC Comics scribe Bryan Q. Miller (Smallville, Batgirl, Teen Titans) about a potential interview about the upcoming Smallville Season 11. He graciously agreed and with the help of some other Superfriends (thank you Brandy!) podcast host/creator/producer and my close friend, Dan Schmidt, and I got to interview Bryan for, what turned out to be a very inciteful episode of Across the Airwaves, as ATA and Retro Reviews unite for this&amp;nbsp;unprecedented&amp;nbsp;challenge, that only super-friends can face. In any event, we were very humbled that Bryan agreed to the interview and want to publicly thank him for all of his work at DC, as well as the insight he gave us, on and off camera. Now, before we hear our lovely ATA Corps complain that Nico Reifsteck &amp;amp; Woo S. Kim&amp;nbsp;were not in on the interview, do not be alarmed, they are fine, in fact, they sent us some of their questions for Bryan, so they were included. So, on that final note, I will ramble on no longer, I only wish to give to the world, Across the Airwaves' interview with Smallville Season 11 writer: Bryan Q. Miller!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I know the introduction to this episode says that ATA 75 is all about reviewing all the content that made up this week's DC Nation and our favorite live-action shows that are currently airing new episodes but we discovered that covering both of these sections made this podcast way too long.&amp;nbsp; So to make keeping up with our show much less daunting for you loyal followers out there, we've decided to separate our reviews of DC Nation, which focus on Green Lantern The Animated Series, Young Justice and DC Comics Animated Shorts into its own separate ATA Podcast Spin&amp;ndash;off. In other words, with DC Nation now out of the equation, ATA 75 features Nico joining the party as we review new episodes of Once upon a Time, Psych and Supernatural as well as reveal our favorite comedic moments from Fox's Breaking In, Modern Family and the long-awaited return of Community.</description>

                    <description>Smallville has changed the lives of millions, and I do not believe that this is an&amp;nbsp;exaggeration, and since this shows creation, I have wanted to talk (on air with Dan Schmidt and Woo Kim) about the episode that changed mine and made me really want to be a hero. This episode is the 121st episode of Smallville, written and directed by SV-scribe Steven S. DeKnight, the 11th episode of season 6, and the 1st episode of Smallville I have ever seen, this is&amp;nbsp;Justice! On this week's special episode of Retro Reviews, ATA creator, host, producer, and my friend Dan Schmidt, my co-host, friend, and sidekick Woo S. Kim, and myself, Michael J. Petty will talk about our experiences with this episode, our reactions to a live-action Justice League, Cyborg replacing Martian Manhunter in the New 52's JLA, and our over-all thoughts on DC Comics, over the past 75 years. This is Michael J. Petty, and if you're listening to this, you are the resistance!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, if you haven't caught on already it's pretty obvious that we are all about superheroes and with that thought in mind, I'm proud to present Across The Airwaves as the first premiere podcast source to cover Cartoon Network's new Saturday morning lineup entitled DC Nation! And when I say that we're covering DC Nation, I'm not just talking about more Young Justice reviews, I'm talking about an entire section reviewing the entire programming block dedicated to the characters of DC Comics from episodes of Young Justice and Green Lantern The Animated Series to the animated shorts and superhero mythbuster clips that test out real-life versions of comic book objects such as Green Arrow's Boxing Glove Arrow. Plus to sweeten the pot, this new DC Nation&amp;nbsp; section will be joined by another superhero expert here at ATA (next to myself) Smallville Retro Reviews' host Michael J. Petty.
However, for those of you worried that Michael joining us means Nico will not be a part of this week's episode, WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK as he joins the party for our extended section dedicated to the return of Fox's Breaking In where we reveal our favorite comedic moments from the episode and discuss many of the changes that were made for Season 2. Also as always Nico provides us with his very informative news section and together we review new episodes of Once upon a Time, Psych and Person of Interest as well as give our favorite comedic moments from The Big Bang Theory.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week Nico and I are making things up as we go while we run from a giant boulder, breakout of a tomb filled with snakes (SNAKES! I HATE SNAKES!) and sneak aboard a submarine all to find the lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. Actually, we are not going after&amp;nbsp; the infamous radio for speaking to God that can melt a bad guys face off, we're just recording a podcast featuring reviews on a new episode of Castle and the Midseason Premiere of Psych as well as our favorite comedic moments from this week's Modern Family. However, since Psych had an Indiana Jones themed episode we decided to apply the same adventurous theme to ATA 73, so grab your Fedora, crack that bullwhip and click the link below for a somewhat shorter but satisfying podcast&amp;nbsp; which captures the spirit of adventure.</description>

                    <description>Hello Retro Reviews Junkies, and welcome back to&amp;nbsp;ATA's Smallville Retro Reviews! I, your host and "professional" podcasting singer,&amp;nbsp;Michael J. Petty&amp;nbsp;would like to personally thank all of you for sticking with us for 21 episodes + our&amp;nbsp;Power Rangers Special&amp;nbsp;(23 if you count "Zod's Tanksgiving" twice!) as would my Dick Grayson to my Bruce Wayne aka&amp;nbsp;Woo S. Kim! Anyways! It's a&amp;nbsp;Brand New Day, and the sun is high, all the birds are singing cause we're back in action! This episode, Woo and I cover the newest&amp;nbsp;The Avengers&amp;nbsp;trailer in exclusive detail, as well as talk about&amp;nbsp;Justice League: Doom&amp;nbsp;(which just came out last week) which lead into some&amp;nbsp;DC Comics&amp;nbsp;talk. BUT! The main theme of this episode, as always, is Smallville in the form of our discussion on&amp;nbsp;Bryan Q. Miller's Smallville: Season 11, coming to the Internet next month and to your local comic book stores this May! Shout out to&amp;nbsp;St. Charles' Graham Cracker Comics&amp;nbsp;in Kane County, Illinois (which I visit (almost) very/other week). After this, yes, there's MORE, we cover this first half (give or take a few episodes) of&amp;nbsp;Supernatural's Seventh Season! Including the death of Bobby and Cas (NOT in that order!), Season 8 predictions, Lucifer, and the Leviathans! So, thanks guys for tuning into this episode, which, before fading out with the sounds of Michael J. Petty and Air Supply, has a few "special" surprises. So, enjoy!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, you know how villains are characters that we love to hate because we despise the fact that they can stay one step ahead of the hero but&amp;nbsp; love it when they force that same hero to reach new heights by setting up a search for their long-lost father or forcing them to unlock a hidden telepathic ability? Well, this week on television it seemed that every villain in the book raised their ugly head as the evil Mayor took steps to destroy a romance on Once upon a Time, Castle contended with a betrayal from someone he trusted, Alcatraz unleashed an inmate who tried to gas an entire subway train and that damn sneaky Elias from Person of Interest proved that even Wall Street isn't safe from his criminal empire.
However, the title of most dastardly villain for the week would have to go to Fringe's David Robert Jones as he proved that he is capable of things much more sinister than kidnapping blonde female FBI Agent's out of weird places like gas station bathrooms. On that note, our sitcoms didn't even escape acts of villainy as Howard on The Big Bang Theory had a fateful encounter with a crazed armadillo and Modern Family featured Luke setting up a vile trap to bring Lilly down. Again, with all this talk about villains you're probably scared that bad guys will be coming after you while listening to this podcast but don't worry Nico and I will ease your fears as we give you reviews on the&amp;nbsp; emergence of villains that seemed to occur during this week in television. Plus to make you feel even better we will even throw in an extended discussion on Fringe because yes, the episode was that great.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, get ready to enter the world of espionage as this week's Castle having our favorite mystery writer go all Secret Agent Man while teaming up with his ex CIA girlfriend inspired us to give you a spy themed podcast. And through connecting the dots with all of this week's airings of our favorite shows we realized that they each contained an aspect of a secret agent's life with Once upon a Time's Mayor reminding us that behind a pretty face can lie an evil mind and Alcatraz telling us that with a mad bomber around every move you make, another chance you take because odds are with the CIA using drug dealers to finance the war on terror, Person of Interest's Reese may not see tomorrow.
Yes, I think you know what classic television theme I'm going for but how I'm going to fit Big Bang Theory and Modern Family into it, is beyond me unless a very ugly painting or a drunken Claire wanting to have Cam and Mitchell's baby has something to do with a mad man's evil plot to rule the world like David Robert Jones kidnapping Olivia out of a gas station bathroom on this week's Fringe. However, on Supernatural that pesky Satan inside of Sam's head seems to be up to something dastardly, which inspired an e-mail from ATA's own international man of mystery Michael J. Petty about the future and possible Series Finale for the show. So now that you have your objectives, your mission if you choose to accept it, is to listen to this podcast before it self-destructs in 5 seconds (just kidding), but remember to do it at your own risk because if you or any of your team members are captured or killed, the government will disavow all knowledge of your actions.</description>

                    <description>Hello ATA fans new and old, old or young, human or... well, Asguardian? Kryptonian? Hulk? I don't know! Welcome to Across the Airwaves' newest spin-off, entitled, Road to the Avengers!&amp;nbsp; This podcast miniseries is our first attempt at commentating on some of our favorite movies, and what better movie to start off with than "Iron Man"! Iron Man was the 1st of many movies that Marvel Studios was behind to be apart of a "bigger universe", aka the Avengers Universe. In honor of may 4th's release of "The Avengers", we here at ATA, well, mainly Dan and myself, started the "Road to Avengers"&amp;nbsp;campaign! This campaign will start with Iron Man and end with Captain America: The First Avenger, all before the release of Marvel's The Avengers. So, since this is the first ever Road to the Avengers Podcast we just ask that you sit back, relax, put in Iron Man, and enjoy the film with us as we talk about it while watching. So, get ready, because some heroes are born, some are made, and others are built!&amp;nbsp;Stay tuned for the next Road to the Avengers Podcast:The Incredible Hulk!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, in response to Castle's recent Noir episode and this being our 70th show we're turning back the clock about 70 years to give you a Noir themed podcast complete with a 1940's style intro and closing. Plus our Castle section even features a special guest from the days of femme fatales and Maltese Falcons, the daring, ever elusive gumshoe, Dan Schmidt Private Eye. As for the rest of the podcast, we reveal our favorite commercials from Super Bowl XLVI while continuing to fight our way through the on-again off-again nature of the Spring Television Season with reviews on Alcatraz, Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural as well as our favorite comedic moments from the week's episodes of Modern Family and The Big Bang Theory.</description>

On this weeks episode, MJPETTY7 and WSK9002 discuss the two Smallville episodes which feature Lex Luthor as the President of the United States of America! I know, scary right?

(Check out the story "Superman/Batman: Public Enemies" to find out how Lex was impeached) So, after covering the episodes 1x6 Hourglass and 7x18 Apocalypse, the Dynamic Duo tackle more news on the CW's new (potential) super hero series: Arrow!

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, first off I'd like to thank all of you who either hyped up or joined us for our Chuck Finale Live Show otherwise known as Chuck Versus The ATA Live Show, it was really great to get the opportunity to converse with people who actually listen to our show. Unfortunately, due to the event itself along with all the preparation that went into it, we got behind schedule on our regular ATA podcasts. The good news is Nico and I are right on top of this issue working tirelessly to release a barrage of podcast episodes that will get our reviews caught up with the new television you are currently watching.
On that note, our oncoming storm of podcasts begins with this one, ATA 68, a fairytale themed episode adding ABC's Once upon a Time to our slate of reviews with an extended section that gets those of you who may have not seen the show caught up to speed.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, we continue tracking the development of the other addition to our slate of reviews the new Fox Series Alcatraz and review our old favorites such as Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural.&amp;nbsp; Also what would an Across The Airwaves Episode be without our favorite comedic moments from the always laugh out loud hilarious Big Bang Theory.&amp;nbsp; So if you're sitting at home, bored with nothing to do or just simply missing Chuck give this podcast a listen because you might just find some new shows to get into with Once upon a Time and Alcatraz.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, have you ever had those moments in your life where it feels like everything is going your way? Well, that's what happened with Nico and I recording this podcast because we ended up with one of our best episodes ever.&amp;nbsp; Don't get me wrong, there was still editing that needed to be done,&amp;nbsp; but in terms of emotions we were running on full cylinders by giving you some good old fashion drama as this week's Castle prompted Nico to get up on&amp;nbsp; his soapbox to make an intelligent argument about how reality shows are making people stupid one episode at a time and&amp;nbsp; watching the third episode of&amp;nbsp; Fox's new series Alcatraz caused me to express a serious concern about there not being any more original ideas out there for a sci-fi/fantasy TV Series.
However, just because Nico and I got a little opinionated&amp;nbsp; doesn't mean we didn't have any fun with this podcast as we took a breather to discuss our favorite comedic moments from an outstanding 101st episode of The Big Bang Theory and threw around some pretty wild crackpot theories during our discussion about Fringe.
Then from here we went into what I call the main event as Nico who unfortunately was not able to join us for Chuck Versus The ATA Live Show was given the floor to give his thoughts on the Chuck Series Finale with a heartfelt sendoff for the little show that could that was worthy of the podcast equivalent to an Academy award. I've known Nico for a very long time and&amp;nbsp; next to the MDA Summer Camp that we used to attend, saying goodbye to Chuck is the only other thing that I've ever seen him get this passionate about so get ready to bring out the Kleenex if you are a hard-core Chuck fan. Although, the good news is for those of you who might be a little bit apprehensive of listening to this podcast due to the emotion, Nico ends things on a&amp;nbsp; positively optimistic note as he reminds all of us Nerd Herders that we have not heard the last of Chuck Bartkowski and the Buy More. So please drop whatever you're doing and listen to this podcast because it's one of ATA's best by simply giving you some serious closure to Chuck coming to an end especially if you were somewhat upset by the ending.</description>

                    <description>Over the years there has been many characters on Television that I've loved but there isn't one that I admire as much as Chuck Bartkowski. In the world that he exists in most people just see him as a lowly Buy More employee, you know the guy that you call when there's a computer emergency.&amp;nbsp; Then again, to&amp;nbsp; the people that are closest to him and us as the audience Chuck is a goofball nerd, a hapless romantic, a heroic spy but most importantly Charles Irving Bartkowski always knew how to help those in need by just emanating this internal optimism that had a habit of reminding us no matter how hopeless things appear to be, they can turn out to be okay in the end. In fact, I'd like to think Chuck created a movement in the real world that inspired fans to live life with his eternal optimism as we tirelessly went out to buy our 3-D glasses, order Subway sandwiches and join in on a flash mobs all to overcome the hopeless situation of NBC canceling Chuck but somehow like with the experiences of the show's title character things turned out to be okay as the show did the impossible of being renewed not just once but twice, something that has never occurred in the history of television. And&amp;nbsp; you&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; want to know why we kept wanting more Chuck? It's because he almost acted&amp;nbsp; as an IT repair man of our personal lives giving us the instructions on how to overcome our shortcomings and failures by just simply being positive with everything we do.
Now, after five seasons of fun adventures our intersect training wheels have been taken off as Chuck has come to an end with the Buy More's automatic doors closing before we really got to see things between our hero and the love of his life, Sarah were going to be okay but as a reviewer on Small Screen Scoop.com put it best you don't need someone to tell you that Chuck and Sarah will be okay, because you just know it. Again, there's people out there who were absolutely infuriated by the open ended nature of this ending but ultimately what the Executive Producers&amp;nbsp; were going for is giving us that last piece of vital advice before sending us into a world without Chuck. In other words, Fedak and Schwartz not allowing us to see&amp;nbsp; Chuck's future&amp;nbsp; but leaving us with the assumption that it will be okay is there way of telling us how to live our own unseen future, with eternal optimism or else we will end up like that fun killer Daniel Shaw.
On that note, we here at ATA full well understand that living your life with constant eternal optimism is not easy to do especially with one of their favorite shows from going off the air so to keep you from running around screaming pineapple, we decided to have an event called Chuck Versus the ATA Live Show to act as a final tribute to the little show that could, which played a part in the creation of our podcast. However, this chance to say goodbye extended beyond myself and Smallville Retro Reviews' host Michael J. Petty as we got some of you listeners out there to join in on reminiscing about the great times we had watching Chuck from the pulse pounding action to the Jeffster performances and the heartwarming moments. Although, for those of you who didn't make it to join us after the airing of the Chuck Finale we proudly present to you a rerecording of Chuck Versus The ATA Live Show...</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week marks the beginning of Fox's Alcatraz being added to our slate of reviews and let's just say that it all started with a big bang because this episode is dedicated to celebrating the 100th Episode of The Big Bang Theory. So to make this an extra special bazinga Nico and I decided to give you an extended Big Bang Theory section featuring not just our favorite comedic moments from the 100th Episode but our thoughts on the big twist that occurred with Penny and Leonard's relationship at the end of the episode as well as our favorite comedic moments from all 100 Episodes of The Big Bang Theory. Also the fun doesn't stop there as ATA 67 has reviews on an extremely thrilling episode of Castle, Person of Interest, Chuck, the return of an old enemy on Fringe and our favorite comedic moments from a bleeping new episode Modern Family.&amp;nbsp; By the way just so there isn't any confusion, the review on Chuck in this episode is the same as what was featured on last week's ATA Episode 67 Sneak Preview.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode is entitled Don't Go Breaking My Heart because Cam and Mitchell sang the actual song on the Modern Family and we don't want Fox to go breaking our hearts over their recent stunning announcements.&amp;nbsp; The first being Fox calling Fringe a money pit that has put Season 5 in doubt and second the network setting the release of new Bones episodes to an undetermined date following the airing of the new American Idol season. However, despite this awful double whammy that sent us reeling, we did have something to be excited about on this ATA Episode an e-mail from ATA Supporter Jason Andorfer that made it into our review section for Person of Interest. Also this week we have some great discussions on Castle, an episode of Bones that was one of the series' best, Person of Interest, the third to final episode of Chuck, Fringe and a fun throwback to The Untouchables on Supernatural. Oh, and let's not forget our favorite comedic moments from this week's episodes of The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family.
By the way, don't forget to join us this Friday, January 27 for our Chuck Finale Live Show (Chuck Versus The ATA Live Show) at 10:15/9:15c on our UStream page.</description>

                    <description>Hey guys! For our landmark 15th episode, Woo and I decided to continue where we left our last episode off, the Season 2 finale Exodus. We return with the Season 3 premiere and second episodes Exile and Phoenix! These episodes go hand-in-hand and relate much to our previous episode. We also reveal some new news about DC Comics logo, George Lucas, and the CW's Green Arrow series "Arrow". So, join us again next week for our episode on two of my most favorite Smallville episodes, Stray and Ryan!
And don't forget to tune into Across the Airwaves' Ustream channel at 10:30/9:30c this Friday, January 27, 2012, for our special retrospective live show (Chuck vs The ATA Live Show) for the NBC series Chuck which will be concluding this Friday as well.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I invite you to rap with me, guess who's back? Back again, The Doctor's back, tell a friend. So why are you still here rapping?&amp;nbsp; Go out there to tell everyone you know that The Doctor's return means that Across The Airwaves, the only podcast that's as cool as a bowtie as a special treat on its 65th Episode our review on the 2011 Doctor Who Christmas Special for all of you Whovians down in Who&amp;ndash;Ville, all the tall and the small.&amp;nbsp; Wait a minute, wrong group of Whovians, but it's a perfect way to segue into announcing that Michael's How the Grinch Stole Video Podcasts led the way into giving ATA it's largest number of listeners per month so kudos to him on that one.
Going back to this podcast episode our review of the Doctor Who Christmas Special&amp;nbsp; is complemented by our favorite funniest moments from a new episode of Modern Family along with a discussion on the Midseason Premiere of Supernatural. We also continue with our series of reviews on the final season of Chuck with this week's episode being highly entertaining but leaving us scratching our heads on where the heck this show is going in regards to its finale, even though we are trying really hard to just sit back and have fun as we watch Chuck come to a conclusion.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's Chucktasticly filled podcast features reviews on not just one but two episodes of the fan favorite TV Series Chuck. The first episode Chuck Versus the Santa Suit was the biggest episode of the series since its spectacular Season 3 Finale giving us everything we wanted to see from the return of a major villain. As for the second episode Chuck Versus the Baby, the cliffhanger that we were left with at the end of the previous episode caused us to go into it really pumped up only to be disappointed but then later satisfied as we were given a feel-good ending that left Nico and I smiling. Also since we had the extra time, Nico and I discuss if Chuck being originally picked up by another network besides NBC would have allowed it to extend past five seasons and give you our predictions for the Chuck Series Finale.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode is entitled Podcast of Interest because it's obviously dedicated to the new CBS Series Person of Interest, which had Nico and my favorite Midseason Finale for the Fall 2011 TV Season. However, that's not all when it comes to sparking your interest in this podcast since we also discuss the shocking discovery made at the end of the Psych Midseason Finale and use our review of Chuck to explain why people who were disappointed with the second half of Season 4 really should come back to the show since there's some really great things ahead as we head towards the Series Finale. Also as an added bonus Nico gives you the lowdown in his new section on all the Summer Movie Trailers that were released over the Holidays along with links to watch them on our YouTube Channel.</description>

                    <description>It was the night before Midseason Finales and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Actually, quite a lot of people are stirring as Community fans including Nico and I face the possibility that the shows most recent episode Regional Holiday Music might be its final episode due to the announcement that NBC has benched Community for new episodes of 30 Rock. So in response to yet another boneheaded decision from the old&amp;nbsp; Peacock, we've decided to throw ATA's Holiday Party in honor of Community by this podcast closing out with this sounds of Troy and Abed's Christmas Infiltration Rap and us giving our favorite comedic moments on what may be their final episode. Plus Community even makes our Chuck review&amp;nbsp; as we discuss two surprise celebrity cameos that occurred in the episode.However, that's not all the presents Nico Clause has in his bag, as this ATA Episode features reviews on the Midseason Finale's for Castle and Bones that left Nico and I on opposite sides of the fence when it came to them being good or not.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, we use this week's episode of Person of Interest as a soapbox to explain how it has become one of the best new shows on television and our review on Chuck gives the promise that it's on track towards once again becoming the little show that could we had such a soft spot for in it's first three seasons. Also there's more where that came from as we round this podcast out with our favorite comedic moments from a Christmas episode of Modern Family as well as a standard episode of The Big Bang Theory.</description>

                    <description>Hi ATA Listeners, I have some very sad news to report Sam and Dean Winchester's grumpy mentor and monster researcher extraordinaire Bobby Singer has tragically died at the hands of&amp;nbsp; THAT DAMN GOOD FOR NOTHING LEVIATHAN DICK ROMAN WHO I REALLY WANT TO SEE DEAN BLOW OUT OF HIS MISERY WITH A SHOTGUN BLAST TO THE HEAD!&amp;nbsp; Anyway, in coming down this week's ATA is obviously dedicated to the memory of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; everyone's favorite drunken Demon Hunter, good ol' Bobby Singer with this episode featuring an extended Supernatural section and the show ending with a song that I think best describes Bobby, The Allman Brothers Band's Ramblin' Man. However, on a more somber note or for you who are in denial that Bobby is gone ATA 61 also has some solid reviews for the Season Finale of ThunderCats, Psych and Bones as well as our favorite comedic moments from Modern Family and what may be the penultimate to final episode of Community.</description>

This week's ATA is entitled Animation Domination because like Fox's Sunday Night Lineup the majority of this podcast features reviews on two episodes of the Cartoon Network Animated Series' Young Justice and ThunderCats. However, for those of you who might not be animation fans you're not going to want to pass this edition of ATA up since our other favorite shows being on hiatus gave us the opportunity to have an extended discussion on the Castle episode Kill Shot where Staina Katic as Beckett and Jon Huertas gave their best performances of the series.</description>

                    <description>This ATA Episode is entitled Dan and Nico, Interrupted as we got a little off our rocker like the two old guys from the Muppets when it came to reviewing the week's schedule of our favorite shows. Again, Nico's harsh criticism regarding Sweet's interaction with Daisy on this week's Bones was warranted but&amp;nbsp; me being disappointed with this week's episodes of Psych&amp;nbsp; and Fringe came across as a bit wacko. I don't know if it was the soothing saxophone sounds of Kenny G that Shawn and Gus used to take down the killer of the week messing with my head or Supernatural ending with the possibiliy that a major character could die but something made me nutty when recording this podcast. Anyway, regardless of what I was smoking (yes, that one goes out to you ATA Supporter JColeman) my out of place criticism spawned a great discussion with Nico on the week's new episodes of Psych, Bones, Person of Interest, Fringe, Chuck and Supernatural that I'm sure all of you will enjoy. Plus as always we share our favorite comedic moments from Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and Community, which in this episode kicks off an ATA Campaign where you listeners need to go and vote for Sheldon himself a.k.a. Jim Parsons to win a People's Choice Award.</description>

                    <description>Hey Everybody, this week's ATA is entitled Nimrods, Bozos and Crazies because the highlight of this episode is Nico's justified rant during our Chuck section about the stupid decisions NBC has made over the past few years causing the network to go from number one all the way down to number four almost in what felt like overnight. Also this ATA podcast's closing song is Kiss from a Rose by Seal, which was performed on the week's episode of Community, a show that NBC is making the bad mistake of benching for the second half of the 2011&amp;ndash;12 TV Season. However,&amp;nbsp; just because NBC is currently making some really dumb decisions, we don't let them rain on this episode's parade as it is chocked full of great reviews for Castle, Young Justice, two episodes of Thundercats, Psych, Bones, Fringe, Chuck and Supernatural along with our favorite comedic moments from The Big Bang Theory and Community.</description>

                    <description>Hello loyal ATA/Smallville/Woo followers! We are terribly sorry about the delay of Retro Reviews episodes, but this DOUBLE EPISODE will make up for that. In the first hour, Michael J. Petty and co-host Woo S. Kim cover 3 Zod themed episodes of Smallville. 9X1 Savior, 9x22 Salvation, and 10x19 Dominion! One before Zod, two before Zod, THREE BEFORE ZOD! And After that, because of technical difficulties on Michael's end, Woo recorded a second hour Thanksgiving (Tanksgiving) episode featuring the episodes 6x7 Rage and 10X7 Ambush, the Thanksgiving episodes of Smallville. So, enjoy that as well as our Zod half of this Thanksgiving Special! And if you think that's good, wait until our Christmas Specials....</description>

So join Nico and I for a podcast episode where our favorite shows twist again like they did with the cliffhangers at the beginning of last summer. Yeah, you heard me right the episodes of Castle, Psych, Bones, Person of Interest, Chuck and Fringe that we review on this ATA Podcast all feature some sort of twist. However, the fun doesn't stop there as we cover an episode of Supernatural that doesn't fit our episode's theme but is still fun nonetheless as well as give you our favorite comedic moments from the week's episodes of Modern Family, Big Bang Theory and Community.</description>

                    <description>Hello and welcome back to ATA's Retro Reviews!!! So, apparently Woo and I are doing a decent job,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;you're all back!!! Anyway, this week, we are covering two of our favorite Bryan Q. Miller (ex-Teen Titans and Batgirl writer) written episodes of Smallville!!! 8X5 Committed and 8x12 Bulletproof.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I want to sincerely apologize for it taking so long for us to release a new episode. I had some health issues followed by some technical issues with my computer but the good news is everything's fine now and I'm hoping if it doesn't psych you out too much that you're willing to step back through a time warp to help us celebrate the debut of our section on Psych with our review of the show's Sixth Season Premiere. However, the fun of this episode doesn't end with Psych since this podcast includes reviews of Castle, Young Justice, Tim Allen's new sitcom Last Man Standing, Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural along with our favorite funny moments from Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and Community, all from the week of October 10th.</description>

                    <description>HATERS GONNA HATE! That's what we have to say to those fans who dislike the sixth season of Smallville. The season that introduces Oliver Queen, Henry James Olsen, Martian Manhunter, Bizarro, and the Justice League has taken so much hate over the years, that Michael J. Petty and Woo Kim have had enough! They defended the season bravely and nobley, but not enough to excuse Lana Luthor or Noir I'm afraid. ATA's Smallville Retro Reviews episode 5 has been critically acclaimed as the BEST SRR episode to date! So please sit back, relax, and enjoy the rant, err, I mean, show...</description>

                    <description>You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into... the Twilight Zone.&amp;nbsp;
Actually, that's not true, you are actually just a ATA Listener who is going to let me tell you about the strange things that occurred on the editing room floor that got this podcast out to you so late in the week. As you can imagine, there was ain't no doubt about it that this episode had its awkward moments but some of the fun parts include a really strange noise being made in the background during our Doctor Who, Nico trying to reenact a scene from A Streetcar Named Desire, two grown men debating over a relationship between animated cartoon characters and Nico even going to the extent of throwing a Pretender reference into one of our reviews. I mean, who references The Pretender, honestly?! Actually, it probably would be Nico.
However, before you start trying to open an X File this episode does obtain some sense of normalcy because it does feature our promised reviews on new episodes of Doctor Who, Castle, Young Justice, Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural as well as what we thought were the funniest moments from this week's episodes of Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and Community. So give this podcast a listen because even though things may appear a little strange here at ATA, that's not going to keep us from telling you how all the laughs and drama from your favorite shows seem to be shaping up into a very strong Fall TV Season despite not all of the players being on the board yet.</description>

                    <description>Uh&amp;ndash;Oh ATA Listeners! Cass has gone and poisoned the water hole leading to one of the best episodes of Supernatural that we've seen since Season 5.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I know&amp;nbsp; at the end of last season Nico and I were ready to consider&amp;nbsp; the show about the Winchester Brothers hunting the things that go bump in the night dead to rights but this week veteran Supernatural writer Ben Edlund picked us up in the Impala and took us on a thrill ride filled with eweey gooey shotgun shattering Leviathans, hallucinations of Lucifer and a shocking cliffhanger that will make you scream All Hell Breaks Loose Part 2 again. So as a result of Sam and Dean getting their mojo back, we've got a special treat for you, a discussion on Supernatural where Nico and I finally get to show you just how excited we can get about the show like in the old days before we started recording this podcast and the Brothers were hunting Yellow Eyes.
However,&amp;nbsp; just because our Supernatural&amp;nbsp; (we're not worthy of Ben Edlund) Discussion is the main highlight&amp;nbsp; for this week's episode don't count out our other sections because as promised we provided you with reviews of Doctor Who, Castle, the excellent Season Finale of Alphas, Person of Interest and Fringe that are totally worth listening to especially when it comes to crackpot theories about future episodes.&amp;nbsp; Plus we have our Funniest Moments sections for Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and Community that will show you why it's worth taking 30 minutes to watch each of these sitcoms.</description>

                    <description>Hello fellow Smallvillians and ATA fans, Michael J. Petty has returned! This year, I have become an official co-host, but that's not all! I am back to review Smallville's finest moments! Yes, we know Smallville has been completed and Clark Kent is Superman, but we're not really ready to let go of the series just yet. And with me this year (and hopefully next year as well) is a new face to ATA, a "freshman" is you will, Woo S. Kim! Woo and I have talked for about 2 years over the SHoE website, and he volunteered to co-host this section with me. Now, our normal section will only be about 20 to 30 minutes on a regular ATA episode, but since we're reviewing 1x1 "Pilot" today, it went a full hour! Also, Woo will be on with me on a bi-weekly basis as Dan want's to co-host with me as well. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!</description>

                    <description>On this week's special giant sized episode (excuse my Steven Tyler voice) ATA is back in the saddle again as we kick off the NEW Fall 2011&amp;ndash;12 TV Season with a NEW script format,&amp;nbsp;NEW reviews for the shows Doctor Who, Castle, Alphas, Ringer, Sons of Anarchy, CBS's newcomer Person of Interest, Fringe and Supernatural as well as three&amp;nbsp;NEW Podcast segments revealing our favorite funny moments from the Season Premieres of Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory and&amp;nbsp; Community. In other words if you haven't figured it out based on the extreme exciting emphasis put on writing the word&amp;nbsp;NEW, Nico and I have high hopes that this episode is going to kick off a season of ATA that's going to cross the airwaves or review the week in television better than ever before, so if you've just discovered us or have been here from the beginning, I would strongly advise listening to this podcast because it's jammed packed with material that's just the start of something great to come.</description>

Well, that old saying has met up with Across the Airwaves as we have reached the milestone of our 50th Episode. However, just because Nico and I decided to celebrate by using this episode to take a trip down Podcast Memory Lane, we didn't start the fire on the party, in fact Michael is the one responsible by performing his own musical number paying tribute to the variety of topics we've talked about over the past 50 episodes of ATA.
Plus as it turns out this spectacular 50th episode of ATA is much bigger on the inside with Nico and I reviewing the hit British TV Series Doctor Who, SyFy Channel's newcomer Alphas and the most recent episode of the new ThunderCats.&amp;nbsp; On that note, if you've just started listening or have been with us since the beginning Nico, Michael, the new guy Woo and I can't thank you enough for your support over the past 50 Episodes and here's to your support over the next 50 more.</description>

Highlights from this episode include Nico giving all of you listeners the 411 on his adventure in Africa and us using our own brand of sight beyond sight to&amp;nbsp; compare the new ThunderCats Series to the 1984 Version in a discussion that will make you proudly cry, Thunder, Thunder, ThunderCats HO! Plus this is followed up by an in-depth look at Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated that pays tribute to all the Scooby incarnations from Where Are You? to the&amp;nbsp; Live-Action Films with the help of soundbites from the Mystery Inc. Gang and the creepy characters that they've met while mystery solving over the years.&amp;nbsp; Yes, if&amp;nbsp; you're an old-school animation junkie this is the episode for you, so with that I leave you with this question will you listen to this podcast for a Scooby Snack?</description>

                    <description>All those Decepticons and Aliens who oppose our shield must yield because we are bringing you loyal ATA Listeners a podcast episode dedicated to reviewing the hit summer blockbuster movies Captain America: The First Avenger, J.J. Abrams' Super 8 and Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon! Highlights from this action-packed episode include Nico's current trek to Africa bringing Michael J. Petty back to the show for a discussion where&amp;nbsp; sounds from the 80s and early 90s help us explain changes that could've been made to make the movie Super 8 more memorable and our satisfaction that Transformers 3 proved the popular franchise is still about robots in disguise rather than Megan Fox's underpants. However that doesn't come before us taking an in-depth look at Captain America: The First Avenger where Michael and I reveal our theories/predictions about how the film will&amp;nbsp; connect to next summer's Avengers movie.

                    <description>(Guitar playing in background): ComicCon is a festival of media, where instead of just getting info on Comics, we get news on TV, Movies and Video Games alike. But if you feel like the only kid in town without a way to San Diego, here's a song for people who weren't able to attend the Con just like you and MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Now with that I could carry along with my parody of an Adam Sandler Holiday favorite by busting out the chorus get your Cosplay on, it's time to celebrate ComicCon or I can save you ATA Listeners from imagining the horror of Nico or I trying to sing by providing what brought you to this website in the first place. And would you look at that I got what you're looking for right here with a brand-new podcast episode dedicated to letting you experience the sights and sounds of San Diego ComicCon International 2011 right through your iPod/MP3 player.
Yep, this episode is all about the biggest Entertainment Convention in the world and we've got one big episode for you that covers just about everything we here at ATA have an interest in, such as new TV shows like CBS's Person of Interest, Returning Series like Castle, the upcoming movie Amazing Spider&amp;ndash;Man, video games such as Batman: Arkham City and what's going on in the world of Comic Books. In fact, there was so much stuff at this year's ComicCon to be excited about we had to break this episode into two parts.
Basically, to sum it up Part 1 features a section where Nico and I make sense out of the News Headlines that erupted out of G4 Network's coverage of ComicCon as well as our sources on the Internet. We also followed this section up with a discussion on the celebrity panels for the upcoming Spider&amp;ndash;Man movie along with the TV shows Terra Nova, Castle, Ringer, Doctor Who, Torchwood: Miracle Day, Falling Skies and Psych. Then with Part 2 of the podcast Nico and I cover the Panels for Community, Bones, The Big Bang Theory, Fringe, Person of Interest, Grimm, Chuck and Supernatural.
So if you're one of those Listeners who likes to skip around between the topics that we discuss in our episodes use this post as a guide when it comes to which part of this Special ATA ComicCon Episode you want to listen to or if you want just listen to the whole thing to impress your friends with with your infinite knowledge of current Pop Culture. Again, this was a big episode of ATA and that especially goes for all the outside research plus editing that was done to make this recording possible so I sincerely hope you enjoy our tribute to the biggest Entertainment Festival of the year San Diego Comic Con 2011.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, does the summer heat have you down? Well, (Sam and Dave music starts playing) hold on, ATA is coming with Nico and I giving you a preview of the Fall 2011 TV Season. In other words, we're using this episode to discuss the new shows we're going to be watching, the shows we&amp;nbsp; decided to pass on and the predictions that we have for the return of our favorite shows like Castle. Highlights from this episode include my excitement over CBS's Person of Interest a new show from JJ Abrams and Jonathan Nolan, Nico discussing his struggles over having time to add shows like The CW's Ringer as well as NBC's Prime Suspect to his TV watching schedule and we both talk about the Networks failing to see that putting shows of the same genre on at the same time might be a bad idea especially when it comes to Friday night.
Also if you don't listen to the Enhanced ACC version of our podcast here is the list of links to the previews for the new TV Shows and shows in their&amp;nbsp; Sophomore seasons that we discuss in this episode just so you have a frame of reference to work with.

                    <description>Aye ATA Mortals, it is I, the Mighty Dan returning to you from the land of Asgard with a podcast episode, in which thee would consider to be one hammer wielding, ring slinging and submarine lifting of a good time that would make you call out for another as your hand smashes your iPod against a table. Basically, if you haven't caught on already this episode of ATA is all about Michael joining Nico and I to review three of this summer's biggest blockbuster movies Thor, X-Men: First Class and Green Lantern. Highlights from these reviews include an analysis on how Kenneth Branagh's mastery of the material in the Thor comics totally alleviated our fears of the Norse God turned Superhero being translated poorly to the big screen. Also we discussed the talented young actors&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; who by adding their own flair to the popular Mutant characters might have made X-Men: First Class the best superhero movie of the summer and how the lack of this technique in Green Lantern might have ruined DC Comics' attempt at creating another film franchise.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners,&amp;nbsp; join us as we party on Earth, Wind, Fire and Rain style till new TV in September with our reviews on the Season Finales of Chuck, Castle, Bones and Supernatural that are filled with a barrage of crackpot theories and predictions for the return of these shows this Fall. Highlights from the episode include Nico's thoughts on the Smallville Finale since he wasn't able to join us for the Live Show, a strong explanation on why Castle had the best finale of the season and our thoughts on the bombshell dropped at the end of the Bones Finale.
Plus if that's not enough, this episode of ATA creates some Season Finale suspense of its own with two hard-core debates on the Chuck Finale and the writers making a decision in the Supernatural Finale that may have put us on the crossroads with continuing to review the show. But don't worry, even though it bothered us this issue has nothing to do with Lisa and Ben. However, for the answer on if Supernatural will be a part of our slate of reviews in the Fall, you're just going to have to wait until September, just like with new episodes of our favorite network shows. Again, unlike a Writers Room, you listeners out there do have control over the decisions made with ATA so if you want Supernatural to stick around in our reviews, let us know through Facebook posts, Tweets or&amp;nbsp; E-mails.
On that note, even though we're holding off the verdict on Supernatural until the Fall, expect ATA to be around during the summer but first we're taking a brief hiatus to set up a new and improved format for our upcoming coverage of the 2011&amp;ndash;2012 season But we will be back in June to review the summer blockbusters Thor and Green Lantern starring ATA favorite Ryan Reynolds.
Also, we&amp;rsquo;d like to thank our guest hosts AlisaLea from the Young Justice Podcast and Robin Burdge from Media Junkyard and Starkville&amp;rsquo;s House of El for joining us on the Superman Live Show and for all the tremendous support that all you Smallville fans out there gave us on the night of the event.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's Dan here with a very big treat for all of you, our much advertised and anticipated event, Across the Airwaves' Superman Live Show dedicated to celebrating the trials we witnessed throughout the course of the hit TV series Smallville that transformed a high school freshman named Clark Kent into Superman, the greatest hero that the world has ever known.
Basically, as the Live Show started it did a nice job of taking flight with the host of the Young Justice Podcast, AlisaLea Gossage's always wonderful insight on everything Smallville but then this podcast blasted into the stratosphere when we got a big surprise as Robin Burdge, a host on the podcasts Media Junkyard and Starkville's House of El, the number one Smallville podcast on the Net entered the chat room and then faster than a speeding bullet,&amp;nbsp; our very own Michael J. Petty had Robin up on the Skype and talking with us. Yes, you read that right, one last-minute Twitter post got Across the Airwaves biggest celebrity guest yet and thanks to Robin along with AlisaLea's presence this Live Show became exactly what I wanted it to be, an incredibly memorable event dedicated to Superman and one of my favorite TV Shows, Smallville.
Honestly, I know this may come across a little as sucking up but having your and Michael's support when it came to saying goodbye to a show that has been so important to me over the years, meant the world to me especially when some of that support came from Starkville's House of El, and the very podcast that inspired the creation of Across The Airwaves. I mean, just getting the opportunity to ask you questions, Robin to pull back the curtain on the podcast that I've been listening to for the past three years was wicked cool and I sincerely hope that I've broken the ice enough between ATA and SHoE soon to be Geek Out Loud for us to become friends and that goes for the guys at Media Junkyard as well.
So&amp;nbsp; now that I've made Robin who might be reading this turn bright red, there's one thing I want you listeners to take away from this blog post where I've basically kneeled before Zod and declared we're not worthy to some highly successful podcasts, which is listen to the Superman Live Show.&amp;nbsp; I don't care if you're a regular Superman fan, just enjoy watching Smallville, or are just a general fan of ATA, this is one of the best shows that we've recorded since the insight that was given to us by our excellent guest hosts was simply spectacular and if you listened to us live on the night of the 20th, I would still recommend checking out this re&amp;ndash;recorded version because it contains jaw dropping images and audio that we were unable to put into the podcast while we were live due to the restrictions of Ustream.
By the way,&amp;nbsp; if you want to hear more of our excellent guest hosts spectacular insight, check out AlisaLea on her Young Justice Podcast and check out&amp;nbsp; Robin on the Media Junkyard Podcast, the final season of Starkville's House of El Episodes 154&amp;ndash;175 and coming soon to a iTunes near you, the new Geek Out Loud.&amp;nbsp; Also if it's easier to access the links to these podcasts are available on the right-hand side of this webpage under the category of References. Oh and one more thing, I'd like to thank you listeners who joined us during the Superman Live Show, this episode would not be possible without you which is something that especially goes for Shannon Cochrane, Noelia Davila, James Hansson and Josiane Ochman whose barrage of Tweets featuring their favorite Smallville Clark Kent Memories played a huge part in helping me complete the script for this episode, so thanks!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is called Tribute cause well, each of the TV shows that we review in this episode all paid tribute to something.&amp;nbsp; On Chuck, they paid tribute to the motion picture epic known as Star Wars, on Bones all the characters pay tribute to a fallen comrade and on Castle they pay tribute to fashion?! Yeah, I wasn't too fond of Castle covering the topic of fashion either, but at least it created a solid debate with Nico that led into a huge discussion revolving around the death of a major character on this week's episode of Bones, so please make sure that you're all caught up because there's some mega-spoilers in this podcast. Other highlights from this episode include speculation on which character is going to get killed in the Season Finale of Castle,&amp;nbsp; our theory that season seven of Bones is going to put Brennan and Booth up against a Government conspiracy and us giving out random facts about a variety of topics throughout episode. So with that, there's only one thing left for you to do, put the lime in the coconut and listen to this podcast.
By the way, due to preparations that needed to be made for the Superman Live Show and Nico having Final Exams our editing timetable has gotten off a bit so please bear with us as we try to get all of our Season Finale episode reviews released as soon as possible because believe me when I say good things come to people who wait, especially in regards to the Superman Live Show.</description>

Highlights from this episode include how a trip to LA can be added to a long list of reasons on why Castle is one of the best shows on television, a discussion on what we believe to be Bones' best episode of the season and us giving props to Ben Edlund who appears to be the Lone Writer who pulled Supernatural away from the brink of cancellation.

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, with the Series Finale airing this Friday night, Nico and I thought it would be more relevant if we reviewed the penultimate or second to last episode of Smallville before the finale, so here is a sneak preview of Across The Airwaves Episode 42 only featuring our review on the Smallville episode 10x20 Prophecy with the reviews for the week's episodes of Chuck, Castle, Bones, Fringe and&amp;nbsp; Supernatural set to come out in the official release of ATA Episode 42. However, be forewarned&amp;nbsp; that in&amp;nbsp; this preview&amp;nbsp; Nico and I expressed some serious concerns about&amp;nbsp; the Smallville Finale because we like all of you fans out there want it to be a huge success which means that were sharing with you our thoughts on Prophecy early in hopes that you listeners will send us comments, Tweets, Facebook posts and E-mails that will help alleviate our anxiety for the Finale.
By the way, while we are on the topic of Smallville, be sure to join us May 20 at 9:15/8:15 Central on ATA&amp;rsquo;s Ustream Channel for our Superman Live Show dedicated to discussing the Smallville Series Finale and remember for this event to be possible, we need all you listeners out there to send us your favorite Smallville Clark Kent/Superman memories by using e-mail,  Facebook, Twitter, our YouTube Channel or this blog to answer the three following questions&amp;hellip;

Highlights from this Mini Podcast include Michael pointing out the footage from the Smallville Finale that was used in the trailer, our predictions on how Smallville is going to end and us preparing to say goodbye to show that we have grown up with over the past 10 years.
Here is the trailer for the Smallville Series Finale if you want to use it to follow along with our podcast...

It's the end of the TV season as we know it and we here at ATA feel fine, at least for the most part as Nico and I reach a bittersweet crossroad over being extremely excited to see how things going to play out for the characters of Fringe and Supernatural as they face the end of the world in their respective season finales but yet with this week's Bones being used as a backdoor pilot, we were hit with the hard cold reality that some of our favorites like Chuck and Smallville for sure will be coming to an end. On that note, highlights for this episode include an in-depth discussion on Booster the final episode of Smallville written by DC Comics legend Geoff Johns and the gunslinger from the Old West, Dakota Dan joining us for our rooting tooting review of this week Supernatural.
Speaking of Smallville, be sure to join us May 20 at 9:15/8:15 Central on ATA&amp;rsquo;s Ustream channel for our Superman Live Show dedicated to discussing the Smallville Series Finale and remember for this event to be possible, we need all you listeners out there to send us your favorite Smallville Clark Kent/Superman memories by using e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, are YouTube Channel or this blog to answer the three following questions&amp;hellip;

                    <description>On this podcast episode, you don't know what we can find, so why don't you come along with me ATA Listener on a magic carpet ride because this&amp;nbsp; week of television got a little trippy as a Volkoff begins acting like Mr. Rogers on Chuck, Beckett starts hanging out with a writer that's not Castle, Bones believes that Booth saw a Yeti in Nepal, Clark is transported to a darker version of Smallville that exists on an alternate Earth, the Winchester Brothers are driving a Mustang instead of the Impala and to top it all off, Fringe gets animated literally! Thankfully, after a week of television that felt like puffing the Magic Dragon, Nico, Michael and I are here for you Listeners acting as the White Castle to cure your case of the munchies through a great discussion about how Castle, Bones and other police procedural shows are taking notes from each other on how to create lasting romantic&amp;nbsp; tension and Michael joins us for a fairly in-depth discussion on Kent and the other final five episodes of Smallville that makes up for the shows obnoxious five-week hiatus.
Speaking of Smallville, be sure to join us May 20 at 9:15/8:15 Central on ATA's Ustream channel for our Superman Live Show dedicated to discussing the Smallville Series Finale and remember for this event to be possible, we need all you listeners out there to send us your favorite Smallville Clark Kent/Superman memories by using e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, are YouTube Channel or this blog to answer the three following questions...

What is your favorite memory from watching Clark Kent on&amp;nbsp; the TV show Smallville?
The weight andWhat is your favorite memory of the character of Superman?&amp;nbsp; (This can come from anywhere, comics,&amp;nbsp; the George Reeve Superman, the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, the many animated versions of Superman, Lois and Clark,&amp;nbsp; Superman returns&amp;nbsp; or something more obscure like buying your first Superman action figure.)
How has the character of Superman inspired you personally or why do you love the character?

Just as a minor note Michael and my excitement/sadness over the upcoming Smallville Series Finale caused our Smallville section to be a little long-winded this week making this podcast episode longer than usual so if you're not a Smallville fan just skip this section, which goes from 01:16:07 to 01:56:38 and you'll have a podcast that is our normal standard length.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's episode don't call us sidekicks, as we have our resident superhero expert, Michael join us for an in-depth discussion on Cartoon Networks and DC Comics' brand-new hit animated series Young Justice. In this section, we not only review Young Justice but go over the show with a fine tooth comb as Michael and I give our thoughts on the first nine episodes of the series, analyze each of the characters one by one and talk about our future predictions for the storyline. However, if you're not really a big fan of superheroes that doesn't mean that you should take a pass on this episode because what would an Across the Airwaves podcast be without fulfilling your Nathan Fillion fix for the week as we review an episode of his hit show Castle that takes the idea of Law and Order in a whole new direction. Other highlights from the episode include Nico making a pretty&amp;nbsp; solid argument on why this week's Castle was mediocre and yours truly bursting with excitement over DC Comics' plans to dramatically expand their fan base with several upcoming television productions in addition to Young Justice.
By the way,&amp;nbsp; after listening to this podcast, if you want more information on Young Justice or episode by episode reviews of the series, be sure to check out the Young Justice Podcast produced by our friend and contributor AlisaLea.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode is called "Whodunit?" because this week's episode reviews actually ask the question whodunit? with Chuck trying to figure out who is picking off the CIA's Intersect Candidates one by one, Castle helping the NYPD find out who killed the Head Writer on a Soap Opera and the Fringe Team on the Other Side racing to find the identity of Bolivia's kidnappers. Other highlights from the episode include Nico and I getting so excited about Fringe being renewed for a Fourth Season that our imaginations run wild with predictions for the future of the show in a Fringe section that you don't want to miss. Also we dish on some Superman movie casting news brought to our attention by our good friend AlisaLea, use the fact that this week's Castle was filled with a bunch of recognizable guest stars to prove it's one of the best shows on Television and discuss what the concept of Agent X has in store for Chuck's big sister Ellie.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's episode is entitled "Ring My Bell" because the ringing of Dr. Bell's historic bell in this week's Fringe not only gave him a new lease on life inside the body of FBI agent Olivia Dunham but it also signified the rejuvenation of Brennan and Booth's relationship on Bones as well as the plot line of Chuck training Intersect Candidates giving the show's writers, a second wind that should hopefully get them through the rest of this season and possibly a Season Five. Highlights from this week's reviews of Chuck, Bones, and Fringe also include a debate on if Chuck's sister Ellie will become an Intersect Candidate, our discussion on Brennan and Booth relationship prompting Nico to dish on the upcoming Bones spin-off and myself being totally amazed by Anna Torv as a Dr. Bell possessed Olivia because she was able to channel sci-fi legend Leonard Nimoy's personality in her performance to a degree that she even sounded like him. So with this theme of resurrection established, why don't you breathe new life into your own week by listening to this highly enjoyable episode of Across the Airwaves.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, this week's episode earned the title of "Ready, Aim,  Float!" because our reviews focus on an episode of Bones where Booth has  a sniper shootout with the show's new big bad Jacob Broadsky and an  episode of Fringe where a scientist gives people the ability to defy  gravity. Highlights from this episode include Nico revealing some  information on The Dark Knight Rises as well as two new upcoming sci-fi  television series,&amp;nbsp; yours truly giving a theory on Bones regarding the  motivation behind Broadsky's vigilante tactics and the both of us using  our experience at Camp Horizon to give some great insight on the  portrayal of the people with disabilities in this week's episode of  Fringe. By the way, for those of you looking for reviews of our other  favorite shows, you are unfortunately going to have to wait because  Castle was off due to the season finale of The Bachelor and Smallville  along with its follow-up show Supernatural are still on hiatus until  April.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, this week's podcast is entitled "Countdown to  Extinction" because the episode of Castle we are reviewing is ironically  titled "Countdown" and with the success of Smallville coming to a close  with a proper ending, several of the shows we cover on Across the  Airwaves are facing extinction or in other words cancellation. Right  now, Human Target is first in line for extinction followed by another  one of our FOX favorites Fringe, which was wrongfully moved to Friday  night. Plus on top of that, Chuck is once again on the chopping block,  where it's been ever since coming into existence.
Obviously, as tremendous fans of these three shows we took some time  out of this week's reviews of Chuck, Castle, Smallville and Supernatural  to defend the shows that we love currently on the bubble for  cancellation, with me getting up on my soap box to once again emphasize  my praise for Fringe being one of the most imaginative shows on  television and Nico calling out the networks to come up with a new  rating system that is more in tune with the Internet as well as DVR.  Again, TV by the Numbers might be the one that needs a new rating system because they have said  that Chuck was going to be canceled over the past four years and it  still hasn't happened yet (knock on wood) but after Nico states his  case, it seems more likely that great television shows like Fringe and  Human Target aren't getting a fair chance due to the networks not  realizing they need to advance with technology.
Other highlights from the episode include more praising of Nathan  Fillion&amp;nbsp; in response to his great performance on this week's Castle,  future&amp;nbsp; predictions for dare I say Chuck Season Five, our pleasant  surprise towards the addition of Superboy on Smallville being a trip  down memory lane rather than a confusing mess of comic book mythology  and our response to the shocking death of a re-occurring character on  Supernatural.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's Dan here, after surviving the world's  greatest bachelor party, that caused me to wake up the next morning to  find a Lemur on top of me, a Bride in my closet and the Luthor Corp.  sign in my living room. I pulled off getting over my magically induced  champagne bender to finish editing this podcast. And on this week's  episode as expected we are reviewing episodes of Chuck, Castle, Fringe,  Smallville, and Supernatural but not Bones because it is on a three-week  hiatus due to American Idol. Highlights include,&amp;nbsp; Nico and I discussing  an episode of Supernatural that hit really close to home as well as us  giving our reaction on a fun but off-the-wall episode of Smallville that  was supposedly the sendoff for one of our favorite characters here at  ATA, the legendary Chloe Sullivan. Also, yours truly once again spreads  the love for John Noble because his performance in this week's Fringe  flashback episode as Dr. Bishop was absolutely superb and I get on my  soapbox to ask all of you TV fans out there to perform a job for  Superman, which is saving four of the six&amp;nbsp; shows that we cover from  extinction at the hands of their respective networks.</description>

Highlights from the episode  include Nico believing that Bones' Happy St. Valentine's Day Massacre  episode has put the show back on track and Yours Truly getting really  excited about Olivia and Peter poking up on Fringe. Also Nico and I try  to get to the bottom of why Supernatural fans are so against the  addition of Lisa and Ben to the story because we believe that after  being through Hell, literally Dean Winchester deserves to get what he  wants, a family.</description>

                    <description>&amp;nbsp;

Hey  ATA Listeners, sorry for the long delay on this week's and last week's  podcast episode but my family has been going through a sad time over the  past two weeks due to my Grandma passing away at the age of 88 so  obviously this milestone of Across the Airwaves reaching its 30th  episode is going to be dedicated to her. Thankfully, when there came a  day, a day unlike any other, where this podcast host found himself  facing a tragic event, fighting the foes no single podcaster could  withstand, my two co-hosts combined forces superhero team up style to  make this podcast episode possible. And on that day, where the ATA  Avengers were born, Nico and Michael both helped me pull this episode  off by Michael joining me to cover this week's reviews of Chuck,  Smallville, and Supernatural and Nico joining&amp;nbsp; me to review Castle,  Bones, and Fringe.
Yes, and as a special feature of our 30th episode you get to hear  Michael's review of the excellent Smallville episode Beacon in an audio  format. However, don't count Nico out because this episode also contains  his much anticipated thoughts on the moment heard around the world for  Bones Fans everywhere as well as our discussion over Fringe's bombshell  with Bolivia that includes some insight from Dr. Walter Bishop himself.  So I guess with that, there's only one thing left for you to do, fasten  your seatbelts and listen to this podcast because you're in for one wild  ride.

                    <description>On this week&amp;rsquo;s episode, we are one TV Show shy of being back to  reviewing a full schedule due to Castle being off this week, but the  good news is after an extremely long wait Smallville and Supernatural  have returned with new episodes. Plus as expected we also have new  episodes of Chuck, Bones, and Fringe to review as well. Highlights from  this podcast include some casting news on The Avengers movie, an  in-depth look on an episode of Chuck that could best be described as  simply satisfying and myself along with Nico being extremely excited  that Supernatural is back on track or in the words of Aerosmith's Steven  Tyler, back in the saddle again.
Also, we would like to thank certain people for joining us last Friday, February 4th for ChloeFest 2011! Special thanks goes to Legendary Women Inc,   AlisaLea, and Allison Mack for potentially listening and for her   portrayal of Chloe Sullivan aka Watchtower over the years.</description>

                    <description>When  it comes to the character of Chloe Sullivan, we Smallville fans, we  have our opinions, some of us believe her destiny is to be a reporter  for the Daily Planet, while others see her as the superhero Watchtower  and then there's the people who actually believe Chloe will become Lois  Lane or&amp;nbsp; the comic book fans like me who beat our heads against the  wall, wanting to ensure that Chloe will forever be a part of the  Superman mythos. However, despite our differences we have one thing in  common when it comes to Clark Kent's best friend and one of his greatest  allies, a love for the character of Chloe Sullivan.
A love that  inspired us to have ChloeFest 2011, a live show event that is Across the  Airwaves version of This is Your Life Chloe Sullivan, through us using  E-mails, Voice Mails and Tweets from fans all over the world to  reminisce on our favorite memories of this legendary character and pay  tribute to the wonderful actress who has played Chloe over the past 10  years of&amp;nbsp; Smallville, Allison Mack.
On top of that to really make  this event something&amp;nbsp; that Allison Mack and Smallville fans can cherish  we brought in a few special guests to help us take a trip down memory  lane as well as review Chloe Sullivan's triumphant return in  Smallville's Final Mid Season Premiere "Collateral".&amp;nbsp; These guests  include Margaret J. Bates, from Legendary Woman Inc. a charity  organization inspired by Chloe Sullivan, recurring star on HBO's  Eastbound and Down, Elizabeth De Razzo who's acting career has partially  been inspired by Allison Mack and it wouldn't be a live show without  the return of ATA's very own recurring host, Brain Trust member, Michael  J. Petty.
By the way, thank you to all the Chloe fans out there  who sent us their favorite Chloe memories as Voice Mails, E-mails and  Tweets, if it wasn't for you this Live Show would've not been possible  and in return for your support all of the Chloe memories that you sent  in were a part of this podcast episode. So now that we've got all the  business out of the way it's time for me to present, without further ado  ChloeFest 2011...</description>

                    <description>Hey  Everyone, if there was podcast equivalent to an Academy Award, it would  go to Nico because his insight on this week's shocking and incredibly  well done episodes of Chuck, Castle, Bones, and Fringe really made this  podcast (that went a little on the long side) something special for all  of you listeners out there. Highlights from this episode reviewing an  excellent week of January television include Nico comparing Castle and  Beckett's relationship to Firefly's Inara and Mal, myself comparing  Bones' Hanna to Scrappy Doo and some news on the casting of Superman in  Zack Snyder's upcoming film.
By the way, I know this announcement is only relevant for about the next  24 hours but please remember to join us tomorrow night February 4th  for&amp;nbsp; Chloefest, a live show event dedicated celebrating the life of Chloe Sullivan airing at 9:15/8:15c on this website: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/across-the-airwaves-live immediately following Chloe's triumphant return to Smallville in the episode Collateral.</description>

Great Scott, ATA Listeners! It's time for another podcast and on this episode there's no roads where were going because this edition of Across the Airwaves has a Back to the Future theme due to us reviewing Christopher Lloyd's guest appearance on the mid season premiere of Fringe as well as the Mid Season Premieres of Bones and Chuck. Highlights from the episode include Nico fearing that Hannah has caused Bones to&amp;nbsp;jump the shark, a discussion of some huge casting news on Christopher Nolan's Batman sequel, The Dark Night Rises and Doc Brown himself joining us for our discussion on this week's episode of Fringe. Also I would like to acknowledge Michael J. Petty's editing debut on this episode and thank him for the great work that he performed on the Chuck section of this episode featuring Jeffster's greatest hits.
By the way, thanks to all of you who sent us your favorite&amp;nbsp;Chloe memories&amp;nbsp;but please keep them coming and remember to join us on February 4th around 9:15/8:15c at this web site:&amp;nbsp;http://www.ustream.tv/channel/across-the-airwaves-live&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;ChloeFest, a live show that is now going to review the episode Collateral, along with celebrating the life of Chloe Sullivan.

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, on this episode of Across the Airwaves, I was&amp;nbsp; replaced  by an impostor, DUM, DUM, DUMMM!!!&amp;nbsp; No, actually the voice you will be  hearing throughout this podcast is mine but something&amp;nbsp; goofy happened  with the Internet connection so my voice was much deeper than usual,  almost as if it was going through a voice changer. Although despite me  sounding like Zordon (yes, here's a guy that made a Power Rangers  reference) this episode is still really worth the listen, because our  discussion on the most recent episode of Castle and the action packed  FOX TV series Human Target is really insightful through us looking at  these shows from a lot of different aspects within the TV Industry.  Highlights from this guerrilla style episode that would make a  conspiracy dude like Guerrero proud include Nico making predictions on  the love story for both Human Target's Chance and our man Richard  Castle. Also I make a request for you to send us your favorite Chloe Sullivan memories to help us enhance our upcoming Live Show, ChloeFest as well as reveal two new ATA segments that will be occurring on Twitter as well as our Facebook wall entitled Things Learned from Watching How I Met Your Mother and Psych Thoughts.
By the way don't forget to support Legendary Women's Inc.'s charity for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in both Chloe Sullivan and Allison Mack's names which will be running  through January 22nd. At the same time, don't forget to join us on  February 4th at 9:15/8:15c for ChloeFest, a Live Show event, celebrating the life of Chloe Sullivan that will be occurring on this web site: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/across-the-airwaves-live following the airing of the Smallville episode Beacon.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, on this week's episode we are only going to have a  review on the mid season premiere of Castle and take a quick look at  the results of the People&amp;rsquo;s Choice Awards because we want to gradually  ease back into a full schedule of reviewing our favorite shows which  includes not only Castle but Chuck, Bones, Fringe, Smallville and  Supernatural. Also we need the spare time to prepare for our next  Smallville Live Show on February 4th entitled ChloeFest 2011,  an episode of ATA that will not only review the episode Beacon but be a  chance through the magic of a Live Show chat for all of you fans out  there to have a conversation on how much we love the character of Chloe  Sullivan and discuss her triumphant return in the Smallville Mid-Season  Premiere Collateral! Highlights from this episode include a commercial  made by Legendary Women Inc. advertising their charity event for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation along with ChloeFest.  &amp;nbsp;Also we announce the winner of the TV Guide Magazine Cover Contest,  Nico uses this week's discussion on Castle to compare his Top 5 List of  the celebrities you would sleep with if you had the chance to yours by  asking you to send your list to acrosstheairwaves@gmail.com and we have  an amusing debate on if the People's Choice Awards are relevant.
By the way as a reminder don't forget to join us on Friday February 4th at 9:15/8:15c for ChloeFest, a live show that will be following the Smallville episode Beacon and airing at this web address: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/across-the-airwaves-live.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, it's Dan here, with our most spontaneous podcast ever.  Basically, spur of the moment is the best way to describe this episode  because getting our Brain Trust member Michael J. Petty set up on Skype  turned into a full-blown conversation about Smallville and throughout  the discussion someone pressed the record button, which voila! produced an episode dedicated to recapping the first half of  Smallville's so far outstanding 10th Season. So if you're a Smallville  fan a grab bowl of popcorn and sit back as we take you through all the  great moments in this first half of the show's Final Season that made  you believe a man can fly.
By the way due to the spontaneous,  uncensored and somewhat on unedited nature of this episode, Nico sadly  was not able to be in this podcast but he will be back to review the  Mid-Season Premiere of Castle.</description>

Jingle  bells, Hannah smells,&amp;nbsp; Dr. Bishop had his cow lay an egg, the Justice  League took on Slade and ATA covers Mid-Season Finales today! If the  tile of this post and my attempt at a twist on a classic Christmas Carol  hasn't already made it obvious enough, the final episode of Across the  Airwaves for 2010 has a Christmas theme. Yes, you read that correctly,&amp;nbsp;  this digital stocking stuffer is our last episode for few weeks due to  our old favorites, Chuck, Castle, Bones, Fringe, Smallville and  Supernatural all going on hiatus along with Nico and I having having  family plans. However just because we're not recording for awhile  doesn't need we will still be accepting your e-mail us, two weeks, wall  posts, and voice male.&amp;nbsp; Also our website here at  www.acrosstheairwaves.com will still be running at full speed with  Michael J. Petty and Nico posting reviews on Human Target, V or whatever  else crosses their minds. Plus Michael will continue to be posting the  videos on our YouTube Channel so be sure to check that out on a  consistent basis. And not that note, I want to wish all of you ATA  Listeners a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year until our next episode,  which will be posted some time after the return of Castle on January  3rd.

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, here's a podcast episode that felt like we used a mirror  box to enter a parallel universe because throughout our discussions on  this week's episodes of Chuck, Bones, Fringe, Smallville and  Supernatural, Nico and I came to the shocking revelation that Anna Torv  and Cassidy Freeman, both actors we've been known to complain about in  the past are getting better in their performances, which is great news  for them and even better news for us because we have even more of a  reason to get excited about our favorite shows. Highlights from this  episode include Nico and I expressing our somewhat disappointment over  Chuck's Mid-Season Finale, getting up on our soap box to complain about  FOX moving Fringe to Friday night and us using a part of our  Supernatural section to make a please for all of you ATA supporters out  there to give us more feedback through e-mail, Twitter, Facebook and  voice mail because we really need support when it comes to formulating  crackpot theories every week.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, it's Dan here, ready to have Nico throw the book at you,  no just kidding. I'm actually here to give you a new podcast episode  that's not so ordinary this week due to Turkey Day formally known as  Thanksgiving. And how the episode is different this week is that we only  have a review of Chuck but don't worry you're not gonna be short  changed on any ATA fun, since we use the extra time created by our other  favorite shows being on hiatus to cover two new hit shows that  premiered this fall ABC's No Ordinary Family and CBS's Hawaii Five-0.  Highlights from this episode include some big casting news on the  upcoming Christopher Nolan/Zach Snyder Superman movie, Nico's  fascination over the term Giant Blond She-Male and we have a slight  debate over the violence featured on Hawaii Five-0.&amp;nbsp; Plus Nico and I  reveal our favorite characters from both No Ordinary Family and Hawaii  Five-0.</description>

Hey  ATA Listeners, it's finally here, the recording of our second Live Show  dedicated to the Smallville episode Patriot completely unedited as well  as chocked full of all the humor, fun, comic book geekyness, sex  appeal, Nico and Lifehouse singing that a true Smallville fan could want  or need after an airing of their favorite show. By the way, about the  Lifehouse singing our special guest host Michael J. Petty only sings a  few bars so you don't have to worry about breaking glass. In fact with  this live show there's nothing worry about since it's just a bunch of  awesome Smallville fans that I've really enjoyed getting to know coming  together to discuss a show that we have thoroughly enjoyed for the past  ten years and with our powers combined we did not form Captain Planet  but we created a memorable tribute for Smallville and DC Comics fans  that really gave justice to the world's original superhero who we  proudly call Superman.

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, have you ever wondered the answers to the questions do  aliens really exist, is the lost city of Atlantis really on the bottom  of the ocean, is there such a thing as fairies and does Belgian  chocolate taste as good as they say? Well on this podcast episode,  Across the Airwaves gets to the bottom of these unexplained and unsolved  mysteries with reviews on this week's episodes of Chuck, Castle, Bones,  Fringe, Smallville and Supernatural. Highlights from this podcast  include my experience of watching Monday night television with a really  tough crowd, Nico being haunted by the character of Hannah even though  she was not in this week's Bones and if you thought we got excited about  Fringe last week, you ain't seen nothing yet, as we both call Anna  Torv's&amp;nbsp; performance in this episode dare I say outstanding.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, it's Dan here with some good news and some bad news  about this week's podcast. The bad news is we don&amp;rsquo;t have a review of  Chuck due to the special about President George W. Bush that aired on  NBC but the good news is we still have reviews on the episodes of  Castle, Bones, Fringe, Smallville, and Supernatural that aired  throughout the week. On that note, highlights from this week's episode  include Nico and I getting excited, I mean getting really excited, over  Fringe. Also we have a slight disagreement on our feelings about Castle,  followed by us praising this week's episode of Bones for being  Hannah-free and Nico giving me psychiatric help on what exactly is going  wrong with Supernatural.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, it's Dan here with a podcast that's a little on the long  side this week, but it's totally worth the listen because this episode  features some really great reviews of Chuck, Castle, Bones, Fringe,  Smallville, and Supernatural that are thought provoking and highly  entertaining too. Wow I used the word "too", I hate that word, it makes  me sound like the Wicked Witch, a Dr. Seuss book or even worse Arthur  Petrelli for you Heroes fans out there, blah! Anyway, this week's  episode included Nico and Dan actually having their "first fight" just  like Chuck and Sarah. Plus on top of that our fight was over the future  of the show Chuck, now that the Intersect has been remove from his head.  However, before things got heated like a crappy reality show, Nico turn  his anger towards Booth's new girlfriend on Bones, Hanna who he accuses  of making David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel look like buffoons. Yes,  Nico does use the word buffoons in this podcast. Also, I make things up  to Nico by saying a comment that causes him to crack up laughing but it  might have also bought us tickets to the very place where Sam Winchester  or the show Supernatural's missing soul can be found.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, I know it's a little after the fact, but here's a  Halloween themed episode of Across the Airwaves featuring reviews of  Chuck, Castle, Smallville and Supernatural but no Bones and Fringe due  to the airing of the World Series on Fox. Highlights from the podcast  include the reading of our first e-mail from our friend who puts the  super in the term Smallville Superfan AlisaLea and Michael J. Petty  gives us some crackpot theories about Sam's resurrection on  Supernatural. Also Nico and I cover all the gamechangers/shockers that  occurred during this week of television which left us simply floored.
By the way, I want to give all of you have a reminder that we are  going to have another ATA Live Show on the Evening of Friday November  19th dedicated to the Smallville episode Patriot so please join us at  this website: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/across-the-airwaves-live for an interactive discussion about the DC Comics Universe and everything Superman beginning at 9:15/8:15c.</description>

                    <description>Hey  ATA Listeners, its Dan here with another set of exciting reviews  dedicated to Episode 5 in the new seasons of Castle, Chuck, Smallville  and Supernatural.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why we&amp;rsquo;re not  talking Bones and Fringe this week, both of these shows are on hiatus  due to the baseball playoffs airing on Fox. As for highlights from this  episode, Nico and I marvel at Joshua Gomez and Adam Baldwin's  performance in this week's Chuck and discuss our first voicemail (YAY!)  from Across the Airwaves' biggest supporter Michael J. Petty.&amp;nbsp; Also in  the last ten minutes of this episode, we call out the writers of  Supernatural to give us answers on Sam's release from Hell and his  shocking personality change.
By the way, keep an eye out for  Across the Airwaves' mini-episode dedicated to Nico and I discussing the  new hit TV series' CBS's Hawaii Five-O and ABC's No Ordinary Family as  well as promos for our next Live Show on November 19th which will be  dedicated to the Smallville episode Patriot.</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA  Listeners, after all the hype your chance to finally relive  that  monumental Friday night extravaganza is here with the re-recording  of a  major event in Across The Airwaves' history our very first Live  Show  dedicated to Smallville's 200th Episode! Yes, now you can listen to  our  unedited and off the hook Live Show all about Smallville, which  many  of you joined in on, any time you want. And with the posting of  this  episode I'd would also to thank all you listeners and everyone over  at Starkville&amp;rsquo;s House of El who joined us for our Smallville 200th episode Live Show. It was an   awesome way to capitalize on a memorable event for Superman Fans   everywhere and I really enjoyed meeting some new people who share my   passion for Smallville. Also special thanks goes to Joe Hummrich for   supporting our Live Show, it truly means a lot to Nico and I for a SHoE co-host to take interest in our podcast.
Any even more special thanks goes to guest host Michael J. Petty, the unsung hero of this Live Show because without his continued support of this podcast, getting us connections with SHoE and creating some jaw dropping promos this event would have not been   possible. So thanks again Michael and I cannot wait for you to join us   again in November where we will be having another Live Show dedicated to   the Smallville mid-season finale entitled Patriot.</description>

Due to the hype  surrounding our  awe inspiring fun loving extravaganza known as the  Smallville 200th  Episode Live Show, which we'd (as in Michael, Nico and  I) like to thank  you for supporting, I got kinda behind on my editing  schedule, but after  much anticipation here is our podcast episode  dedicated to reviewing  the third episodes in the new seasons of Chuck,  Castle, Bones, Fringe,  Smallville and Supernatural. Highlights from the  episode include Nico's  and my crack pot theories for future plot lines  of Supernatural along  with our tremendous new and improved sound  quality!</description>

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, sorry it took me so long to post this episode on   the Web but there were some plumbing problems at my house limiting my   computer access&amp;nbsp; for the week. Anyway if you haven't caught onto the   pattern already (Ooh Fringe reference!),&amp;nbsp; this episode is dedicated   towards Nico and I giving reviews for&amp;nbsp; the second episodes in the new   seasons of Chuck, Castle, Bones, Fringe, Smallville and Supernatural.   Highlights from the episode include Nico giving his two cents on Booth's   new girlfriend, Hanna, myself trying not to be afraid of the writers  on  Fringe attempting to cross the line and the both of us getting more  and  more excited for the Final Season of Smallville.</description>

                    <description>Hi Across The Airwaves Listeners, it's Dan here. This week's episode   is dedicated to something that's been a long time coming, the kick off   of the 2010-11 TV Season. Yes, you read that right the excitement of  new  TV is here, YAY! In other words, this means Nico and I get to focus  on  what this podcast is truly about, weekly episode reviews on your   favorite shows including Chuck, Castle, Bones, Fringe, Smallville and   Supernatural. Highlights from the episode include Nico professing his   undying love for Castle's Nathan Fillion as well as Chuck's Zachary   Levi, myself making a heartfelt plea for Michael Rosenbaum to return in   Smallville's Final Season and the both of us questioning why the  writers  of Fringe keep trying to make us like Olivia (BLAH!) when we  clearly  want more Peter and Dr. Bishop. Also as a minor note for those  of you  who listen to the MP3 version of the podcast, the name of the  actor who  played the Taxi Driver in the Season 3 Premiere is not  Cameron K. Smith  like Nico mentioned, his name is actually Andre Royo.</description>

This week due to the  preparation  needed for our podcast that is dedicated to kicking off the  Fall 2010  TV Season, Nico and I decided to release a mini episode (yes  this time  it is mini, unlike The Last Airbender episode) where we  discuss the  Summer Finales for Leverage and White Collar to give you  listeners  something to do as you eagerly await the premiere of new  shows along  with the return of old favorites. Highlights from this mini  episode  include Nico and my predictions on future seasons of both  Leverage and  White Collar.</description>

                    <description>Hi Everyone,  it's Dan here with another podcast for your listening  pleasure. In this  week's episode, Nico and I pay tribute to Mark A.  Sheppard, the man  who has the uncanny ability to show up on almost all  of our favorite  shows by discussing several of his Television Guest Star  appearances.  However, our reasoning behind dedicating an entire podcast  episode to  Mr. Sheppard comes from more than him popping up on a bunch  of TV  Shows. It comes from his knack for taking a character he is guest   starring as for 42 minutes or a handful of episodes and make them   memorable, which is an impressive feat especially since starring cast   members get at least 12 episodes to generate audience interest in their   character. Most likely in Mark A. Sheppard&amp;rsquo;s mind bragging about his   acting skills is the last thing he is concerned with, he&amp;rsquo;s probably just   glad he&amp;rsquo;s getting steady work. However, Nico and I are extremely   impressed that he keeps showing up on popular TV Shows and we look   forward to episodes that we know he is going to be in due to the fact   that his presence means we&amp;rsquo;re normally in for a treat. So basically,   this podcast is to you Mark A. Sheppard because if you or anyone that   you&amp;rsquo;re connected with is listening, we want them to know that your work   is just as valuable to us avid TV watchers as it is to the people  behind  our favorite shows.</description>

Hi  ATA  Listeners, it's Dan here proudly announcing that we have reached  our  first milestone with Across The Airwaves by Nico and I (along with  some  help from Joel) sucessfully producing ten podcast episodes. Yep,  you  have read that correctly, we've reached double digits and all I can  say  to that is YAY! This week for our tenth episode, Nico and I discuss the  new episodes of Leverage and White  Collar airing on their respective  networks. Highlights from the episode  include myself  comparing/contrasting Leverage and White Collar in a  heavyweight  showdown, our predictions about future episodes and Nico  trying to  figure out the physics of a Love Triangle. Also if&amp;nbsp; you're  paranoid  like Mozzie don't worry there were no Suits listening in on the   recording of this podcast but we may have pulled some cons, so check   out this episode before we're forced to provide Leverage.

                    <description>Hi  ATA  Listeners, it's Dan knowing full well that I told you we were  supposed  to talk Leverage and White Collar in this episode, but  unfortunately we  had a change in plans. This change came from Nico  recently moving to  the Virgin Island to get some schooling for his  Government job, which  is great for him. However, the Islands are being  hit by Hurricanes  putting Nico out of contact to do the podcast. This is  a total bummer  for us because we have had to miss out on our weekly  movie &amp;amp; TV  discussions, plus on top of that we have had a tremendous  raise in  podcast subscribers which we thank you for. With that being  said to  maintain our numbers it is our responsibility to continuously  providing  content to keep all of you interested and excited about the  show. So I  decided to bring in Joel "The Jet" Rodriguez (from the Avatar   Two-Parter) to do a mini episode to hold everyone over until Nico is   available to do the promised White Collar/Leverage episode. But for this   week, Joel and I have decided that we are going to confront the   disappointment of M. Night Shyamalan&amp;rsquo;s The Last Airbender head on by   talking about the problems this movie had and how it could&amp;rsquo;ve been more   like the outstanding Nickelodeon Animated Series it was based on.
By the way as an added bonus, here's a link to an interview where the creators of Avatar: The Last Airbender discuss the show's new spin-off entitled Avatar: The Legend of Korra which will be released in November 2011, on Nickelodeon.

                    <description>Hey Everyone, it's Dan here. Recently I watched the cable station   G4's coverage of Comic-Con 2010 which was a great way to see the sights   and sounds of pop culture's biggest event with out having to deal with   the headache of crowds and long lines. However, as cool as the special   was, there were points that between the talking heads, on-location   reporters and the news ticker running across the bottom of the screen, I   felt like I was getting hit with an overwhelming avalanche of   Entertainment news. This caused Nico and I to feel that you, our   listeners were having the same problem, making us feel that it was our   responsibility at Across The Airwaves to help you brave the storm of   information. So we put our heads together and came up with this week's   episode dedicated towards Comic-Con 2010. The episode includes us   reporting on the news headlines that came out of the event and   discussing the TV celebrity panels where the people behind our favorite   shows revealed information about their new seasons premiering in the   Fall. Yep, you read that right, this episode is as much about Comic-Con,   as it is a preview for the new Fall TV Season, meaning that you need  to  give it a listen cause it's nothing but double rainbows all the way.
Also here are the links to the celebrity panels discussed in the   episode for those of you unable to listen to the Enhanced ACC podcast.   By the way, I've included as an added bonus, a link to the Thor movie   trailer shown at Comic-Con. (Thanks to Michael J. Petty on finding the   Smallville Trailer).

                    <description>Hey ATA Listeners, it's Dan here and first off sorry about taking so   long to post this episode. I had a computer glitch that threw off my   timetable for editing. Moving on to more positive things, this week's   episode was recorded on location at Camp Horizon, a camp for people with   disabilities. Highlights from the episode include an in-depth look at   Camp Horizon starring 19 year Veteran Counselor, Dan Persak. We then   follow this up by having various Campers and Counselors join us on a   conversation all about the world of Television covering topics from   Sesame Street to Homer Simpson to Sept. 11. Yes, things get a little   serious in this episode as we pay tribute to the moments in America's   history that were broadcast on Television. However for those of you   looking for something more upbeat, don't worry the seriousness only   lasts for one segment, everything else is fun. So put down that duckie   and listen to this podcast episode because I think it will leave you   pleasantly surprised.
Before we get to the links I'd like to give a big thank you to   everyone from Camp Horizon who joined in on this podcast episode...

                    <description>Hey it's Dan   here commenting on the fact that recently the disappointment of M.  Night  Shyamalan's The Last Airbender has had us fans of Avatar The Last   Airbender questioning our love for the popular Nickelodeon Television   Series. In response to this Nico and I, along with our guest Animation   Expert Joel Rodriguez decided to dedicate this episode completely   towards this landmark in American Animation just to keep you Avatar Fans   from feeling the need to go hide in the back of the closet. In fact,   this episode has so much great stuff for Avatar The Last Airbender fans   to sink their teeth into like character bios and our opinions on key   story arcs we had to break it into two parts or in this case books. Yes   you heard it here, Across The Airwaves is all about Avatar pride so get   some popcorn, pull up a chair and relax as we bring this outstanding   Animated Series back to the warm and fuzzy place it had in the hearts of   us fans. Besides you never know but we might just get some new people   to check out the show.
Listed below   are the links to Across The Airwaves Episode 6 Book One: Air. The links   for Part 2 will be listed in the next post.</description>
