                <itunes:summary>This Podcast is a free show about the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin. Jason and Karen are members of the Soka Gakkai. Every two weeks they take a Buddhist study point and do their best to make it easy to understand and of use to anyone who listens.
Practical Buddhism for living in the 21st Century, not beside a remote lake or mountainside but in the midst of daily life, with a job to do, a house to run and children to raise.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first show of the year! Tonights Jason lectures on the writing, On Practicing The Buddha's Teachings. His lecture is based on President Ikeda's lectures series from The Teaching for Victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the theme for tonight include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From provisional to true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Buddhism get so confused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former, middle and latter day of the law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accursed time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing our minds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banner of our behaviour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archers of the mystic law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three carts and the burning house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakabuku, compassion and reason&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using struggles to become happy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an great and inspiring experience that covers 40 year of faith from Roxanne Rae in Oregan. We also have music from Nic Saunders who kindly allowed us to play a piece from his Weald and Downland Suite, its called The Water Mill. From the pod safe music network we have Geoff Smith playing Gravity and Death Cab for Cutie with Title and Registration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a podcast that took a long time to write! Tonights show is about death and dying from a Buddhist perspective. My lecture is based on President Ikeda's lecture in Unlocking the Mysteries of Life and Death. I am also very grateful to Donna and Dash for sharing their experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody believes they are going to die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you want to feel when you die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near death experiences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 stages of dying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 paths into 3 virtues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nam myoho renge kyo is not constrained by death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eagle peak and mystical rendezvous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are responsible for how we die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we have some music on the show. First up we have the Canadian, Christie Grace, courtesy of the Podsafe Music Network, playing her version of Joni Mitchells track, Both Sides Now. Beautiful voice! We also have the one and only Howard Jones, singing Building our own future. Thank you so much for all your support and encouragement. Have an amazing week!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for waiting. Welcome to the first show from our new home in Vancouver, Canada. Tonights lecture is based on some passages from a famous letter written by Nichiren Daishonin to his loyal disciple Shijo Kingo. My lecture is based on the first half of President Ikeda&amp;rsquo;s lecture on The Three Kinds of Treasure which can be found in SGI Newsletter No 7908.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shijo Kingo is in the middle of a huge struggle and has written to Nichiren for guidance in faith on how he should go forward. Some of the points we cover include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing as Nichiren taught&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging each other revitalises the SGI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuring others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honest friendship of Nichiren and Shijo Kingo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backgammon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs and victories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge targets and how we achieve them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of jealousy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of shout outs and almost as many questions! We play two tracks from the Podsafe Music Network on tonights show. First we play Falling by Grace Kelly and later we have Gravity by Geoff Smith (who does the intro music to the show!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for listening and for your encouragement, support and patience while we have been moving! Have the best week of your lives and take great care of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we had the good fortune of having William Woollard, Matt MacMillan and Karen and myself sat around our kitchen table. We read two lovely experiences about relationships with mothers, one from two sisters in India, Bipasha van der Zijde &amp;amp; Bishaka Dalvi. The other experience was from Kelvin Lam.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We swapped stories and experiences and played music from the Podsafe music including, Levi Blues by the Lala Girls, Mine Again by Black Lab and Yael Naim with New Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editing took some time and I was able to get the file ready to the digital work on the plane to Brisbane, where when we land I hope to post online!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much everyone for the many birthday wishes you were kind enough to send and for all your good wishes about our forthcoming move to Vancouver. We are continuing to study hard and have started writing the lecture for the next show, so bear with us as we embark on the next crazy adventure. I think its about time we shared an experience of how we have done this, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Longer than we expected but none the less, here we are again with the second of a two part lecture on a letter written by Nichiren Daishonin to Shiiji Shiro in 1261. The letter is called A Ship to Cross the Sea of Suffering. This lecture is based on SGI President Ikedas lecture in SGI Newsletter 8518. It was a challenge to get this done and I suspect you may need to listen a couple of times to pick up all the points. Subjects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a ship to cross the water,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;five flavours,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;discarding earlier teachings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unfurling the sail, 3000 realms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;middle way,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leaving the dock of our karma,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tickets of faith,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the good ship SGI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shoutouts and a question about chanting for stuff! We play Howard Jones singing Building Our Own Future and courtesy of the Podsafe Music Network we play Let me know by the Fire Apes. Thank you for your constant encouragement, it means so much to us. Click on the link on the left hand side of the website if you want a shout out on the show. Take great care and have a fantastic week. Thank you for listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! This show was a challenge to bring you! In the first part of the show which we recorded last week we have William Woollard giving a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin's writing called, The Offering of the Mud Pie. Its a terrific lecture and we hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed recording it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good friend of the show sent us an email and Karen and Jason talk about their reactions and thoughts to it. During the editing, Jason wished he had said more about gratitude in his answer, but then that will be coming up in a lecture soon! Let us know what you think of this section, if its popular we might do some more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have music from the podsafe music network tonight. Firstly, we play David Ushers track, The Music, from his successful album Strange Birds. We close with a wonderful track from Adrina Thorpes album, Halflight and Shadows called Everything Changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to download the show and listen. Have a fantastic week and take great care of yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you for downloading this show and welcome to another episode of A Buddhist Podcast. On tonights show we have a lecture from Jason. The lecture is based on President Ikeda's third lecture on Nichiren Daishonins letter, On Practicing the Buddha's Teachings. Here is a snifter of some the subjects we cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting down to study with the Buddha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handing over responsibility to the youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing as the Buddha taught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing ourselves changes the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compassion amidst our struggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing the right thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A real king in the religious world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a very moving experience from Sharon in Hong Kong as well as shoutouts that criss cross the globe! Courtesy of the Podsafe Music Network, we play Some People Say from the Saucier album by Ed &amp;amp; Jojo aka the Supersuckers and quite possibly one of our most favourite tracks, Great Day by Jody Gnant!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to another episode of A Buddhist Podcast! We have been away travelling, but we are back with a lecture for you based on President Ikeda's lecture from SGI Newsletter NL7973XV.

&lt;p&gt;My first campaign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct teacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four powers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brave question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 years of preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakabuku and Shoju&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing correctly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual our music tonight comes from Podsafe Music Network at Musicalley.com. We play Round the Bend by Adrina Thorpe and Anywhere Under The Moon by the Dala Girls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we seem to be on a roll! Welcome to another episode of A Buddhist Podcast. We are delighted to present Chapter 2 from William Woollards new book, Buddhism and the Science of Happiness. Reading, recording and editing this chapter really gave me pause to think!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the wonderful podsafe music network at mevio.com we were able to bring you three fantastic tracks tonight. The first is from Yael Naim who sings New Soul. The second and third are from a great and talented duo called the Dala Girls from Toronto, Canada. We play two tracks from the Dala Girls, Levi Blues and Hockey Sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an experience from John Renner in the US and we read the World Tribunes obituary for David Kasahara who recently passed away. Our shoutouts criss cross the world and also Jason answers a question as to what the quotes are on the family alter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual look to the right hand side of our website for the shoutout link if you want to make use of it. Alternatively you can send us a note on the Android or Iphone app! Thank you so much for your continued support. Please take great care and have a fabulous week. Sometimes its hard, but chant and determine to win, there is always a way through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wir sind das Volk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be the change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heroine, Nichimyo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No laws can change the human heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice Buddhism to become a great human being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lotus Sutra is the broadband of Buddhism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Dragon Kings daughter can reveal Buddhahood - So Can We&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot allow people to suffer because of the terrible leaders we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our courage ripples out to encourage others&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another show! It has been a really long time, thank you for bearing with us. Jason has new work that requires a lot of hours and travel that we are still getting used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On tonights show we have a lecture on the letter that Nichiren Daishonin wrote to the Ikegami brothers in 1275, its called simply, &amp;ldquo;Letter to the Brothers&amp;rdquo;. Tonights lecture is based on President Ikeda&amp;rsquo;s lecture from SGI Newsletter 7832 and subjects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buddhism is about overcoming negativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking the talk, the first three presidents of the Soka Gakkai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dad, the priest, the wives and the brothers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faith is believing in peoples greatness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We lose because of fear and influence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We win because of wisdom and courage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three obstacles and four devils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will power is not enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United in purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master your mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change within creates change without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have wonderful experiences from Jay Osburn in Michigan (The artwork for this episode is of Charley) and Gerald White in Las Vegas in the US. We have shoutouts that really span the world and of course music. On tonights show we play&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Link to Nowisnow on ITunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/days-of-summer/id128862375?i=128862383"&gt;Days of Summer by Now is Now&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="stavia on Itunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/lucky-day/id152418234?i=152418243"&gt;Lucky Day by Stavia&lt;/a&gt;, both courtesy of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Link to the Podsafe Music Network" href="http://www.musicalley.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Podsafe Music Network on musicalley.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>A very merry christmas to you! This last weekend we recorded tonights lecture in the kitchen of the amazing Jackie Evans from Gower and Swansea West District in West Wales. We had a wonderful welcome and met some great people! On our return we finished the show and are delighted to bring you tonight, a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin's writing, Letter from Sado.
The lecture is quite long and was recorded very late at night, so you might want to listen to it in parts! Subjects include:

Time is the biggest contribution we can make

I solemnly swear that I want to do good

Temples were an investment

The loss of each individual life matters

Clinging on to life

An ungrudging spirit

Use problems to become happy

Earnest resolve

Refuting mistaken teachings

Doing the right thing

The heart of a lion king

We play two tracks from the Podsafe Music Network, Panacea by Bill and Merry Christmas Angel by the wonderful Vittoria Conn.
Thank you so much for your continued support of the show, we really are very grateful.
Have a truly wonderful new year!</description>

                    <description>Welcome to another episode of A Buddhist Podcast! On tonights show we have a lecture on the letter that Nichiren Daishonin wrote to Soya Kyoshin, its called The Essentials for Attaining Buddhahood. Subjects include:

Who was Soya Kyoshin?
Essentials are not Optional
Bodhisattva Superior Practices and the Latter day of the Law
Reality and wisdom
Don't bend the teachings to suit your karma
Misguided priests versus correct teacher
Challenging wrong doing
Standing firm with a teenage daughter
Bridging the gap between people and Buddhism
My mentor
And of course we have the shoutouts and also . . . we also have three brand new songs.

I think, we may be the first podcast to debut two new tracks by Howard Jones. "Soon you'll go" and "Love never wasted" are from Howard's new album, Ordinary Heroes, which is being released on November 3rd. For more information take a look at his website here. Thank you Howard for letting us play these tracks

We also debut a wonderful new song from Vittoria Conn, it's called "Where would you be" which will be appearing very soon! As soon as we have a location on ITunes or elsewhere we will post the link here.

If you are looking for the tshirts you can get them from our tshirt shop which is generously powered by the wonderfulPressoffers.co.uk. Thank you so much for listening tonight, have a fantastic week!</description>

                    <description>For those of you who are familiar with William Woollards excellent book, The Reluctant Buddhist, and have been listening along on the podcast, you will have noticed something. The experiences from Chapters 5 and 6 were missing. This is because William really wanted to have someone else read them, and that someone tonight is the wonderfully warm and loving person that is his wife, Sarah.

So reading The Story of Joanna from Chapter 6 and The Story of Sally from Chapter 5 of The Reluctant Buddhist is Sarah Woollard.

Then we have music from Heather Sullivan. She sings Stronger from the Podsafe Music Network.

We find out what happened to Jason this month, we have shout outs and we read a letter from an SGI member, Frank Amatefe in Ghana, Africa.

We finish with another track from the Podsafe Music Network by Angelique Kidjo called Gimme Shelter featuring Joss Stone.

We have some great shows lined up for you and are so excited about all the different developments that are happening. Look at for a new look to the website that is coming soon and also for a new colour of our t-shirts, Stone Blue! If you are looking for the tshirts you can get them from http://www.pressoffers.co.uk/abuddhistpodcast2 

Thank you so much for your constant support and encouragement. Have a truly wonderful week!</description>

                    <description>We can hardly believe that it is almost exactly half way through 2009! Wow! Tonight we bring you a lecture on the letter written by Nichiren Daishonin called, Hell is the Land of Tranquil Light. Some of the subject teasers for tonight include:
We need to reveal Buddhahood to overcome our karma
Lets try and remember the names of our mothers
The icy wind of thoughtless encouragement
The ten worlds exist in life and death
Giving 150% . . .in small bursts
Are you in a prison of someone elses making?
Changing circumstances won't change karma
Attaining Buddhahood just as you are
It is human to feel grief when someone dies
Gohonzon is the baseline of Buddhahood
Chant first, shout later.

We have music for you from the Podsafe Music Network. First up is Carbon Leaf with A Life Less Ordinary. We close the show with Shines Right Through Me by the amazing Great Big Sea! The links we have for the tracks will take you through to where you can buy them on iTunes and the links for the names will take you through to their own website.

Karen and I are busy posting off orders for our new Tshirts! If you have yours and you send us a photograph, we will consider putting it on the artwork for the show, so send them in to jason(at)thejarretts.com!
Thankyou for your comments and encouragement. Thank you for all the support you give us, we really do feel and appreciate it. Please take great care and have the most amazing and wonderful week!</description>

                    <description>Tonight we have a lecture on "Letter to Misawa". This lectures is about many things, but one thing is for sure it does address the three obstacles and four devils. Perhaps because it does so it might explain why it has taken 5 months to write 3 times, why cables went missing right before we started the show and a myriad of others obstacles emerged! Some of tonights themes include:


Practicing correctly involves transforming the negativity in the world around you
Three obstacles and four devils
What is the devil king of the 6th heaven anyway?
Nikko takes it to the man
Self reliant faith
The Gohonzon certifies that Buddhahood exists
Some experience of overcoming obstacles
What do you want to break through?
Why is the Soka Gakkai different?

Its a full show and along with the shout outs we play three tracks tonight from the Podsafe Music Network (http://www.mevio.com)
We play Code Monkey by Jonathan Coulton (http://music.podshow.com/music/listeners/artistdetails.php?BandHash=97007092b961d7e9a7d77c2614ee0086) who sings Code Monkey http://www.jonathancoulton.com/ 
http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=211036259&amp;s=143444

And we play two tracks from Adrina Thorpe (http://music.podshow.com/music/listeners/artistdetails.php?BandHash=a892daf89e5efee9bd4705bbf8c092fc) who sings  Coming Home and Fly Fly Fly
She is also on iTunes!

Well that is what the substance of tonights show is! William Woollard reads Chapter 3 from his extraordinary book, The Reluctant Buddhist!

We have shoutouts and the music tonight comes from Beth Thornley. Its not like us to only play one artist, but we liked both of the tracks! So from Beth Thornley we play Mr Lovely and Birmingham. As usual we are very grateful to the Podsafe Music Network for providing us with the ability to play this music on our show.

We are working on two new shows which will be appearing in the next few weeks! Thank you so much for listening to the show and for all your wonderful feedback. Have a great week and take care of yourselves and the people around you.</description>

                    <description>Tonight's show is a bit of an experiment! For some time now we have had a lot of requests from listeners to provide support for the level 2 study courses that are taking place in Europe at the moment. This study will culminate in an exam in mid November for those who want to take it. William Woollard has also had many requests for support in this activity, so we have got together to produce a special edition show!

The exam consists of 5 sections, A, B, C, D and E. Each section has a number of questions. In the exam you will be asked one question from each section. On this podcast, William has prepared an answer for every question. It is NOT a model answer but the kind of answer that William would make based upon the study material provided. Remember the questions require you to use the study material rather than your existing knowledge.

If you are not a member of SGI in Europe at the moment but you would like to follow along, you can hop over to this site and download the study material we are looking at! Remember you need to look for the Grade 2 material.

If you are doing the Grade 1 study course, you still might find value in listening to the show as both Grade 1 and Grade 2 share the same questions in Section E about the Priesthood.

In between all of this study material, we have still found time for some music. On tonight's show we play a wonderful track by Black Lab called Lonely Boy and for the second time on the show Great Day by the amazing Jody Gnant. Music courtesy of the Podsafe Music Network

Thank you for downloading the show! We have a great show coming up in 2 weeks so keep an eye out for it! Thank you as well for all your support.</description>

Kicking of the show is William Woollard who completes the second half of Chapter 1 from The Reluctant Buddhist. Karen reads a truly inspiring contribution from Cindy Woodland from Canada! We have more shoutouts that cross the globe and we attempt to answer a question about how we as parents interest our children in Buddhist Practice.

Tonight we play three tracks from the Podsafe Music Network, Anduze with Just Feel Good, Lee Coulter with I Would Love and Black Lab with Broken Heart!.

Keep a look out for a special show coming out next week. William Woollard has put together some great study material surrounding the Level 2 Study Exam that is taking place in Europe in November.

                    <description>Thanks to Jessica Miller who not only did the wonderful artwork for tonights show but also came up with the idea of asking Kevin Robinson to give tonights lecture. Kevin originally gave this lecture at the North London Area Course at Trets in September this year (2008). 
I travelled up to London and we recorded this lecture at Kevin's wonderful home. Its about Prayer and we hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed recording and putting it together!

Great shoutouts from the wonderful Karen and some wonderful music from Mark Erelli singing The Only Way and Bob Gentry singing Goldie Hawn! Both tracks are available from the Podsafe Music Network.

Again we had planned to play the second half of William Woollards Chapter 1 tonight. However, we wanted to include an interview that we are working on but we did not manage to get it done in time! Bear with us and we hope the next show will include the second half!

Thank you so much for listening and for your encouraging comments and emails. Enjoy the show and have a great week.</description>

                    <description>Tonights show is a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin's letter called 'Reply to Sairen-bo'.The theme is once more on the mentor disciple relationship . Themes include:

Trapped for 3 score years and 10
The disciple chooses the mentor
What is Buddhahood?
Devil kings and demons
I don't want to spend my life in the toilet of mankind
What qualifies the mentor?
Creating a whirlpool of joy.

In honour of 25 years playing music, we play, from the Podsafe Music Network, Howard Jones and his song Building our own Future. We are also lucky enough to have a great track from Peter Robinson called Roar of the Wind for the men of the South of England.

Originally we had planned to play the second half of William Woollards Chapter 1 tonight. However, we wanted to include an interview that we are working on but we did not manage to get it done in time! So the next show will include the second half!

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another show! In this show we look at the second half of On Attaining Buddhahood, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For what reason do we live out our lives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not two lands, pure and impure in themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn't the weather miserable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The schisms of ism's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polishing our mirror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revealing the gleaming motorcycle within&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chanting in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myoho-renge-kyo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Tree Sutra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering our minds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teachers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonights show also includes an obituary of &lt;a href="http://www.shinyatomi.com/"&gt;Shin Yatomi&lt;/a&gt; ), written by Donna Parten and read by Karen and Vittoria Conn. We would like to express our deepest condolences to his wife Carolyn and his family and to all who knew and loved him.&lt;br /&gt; Tonight we have music from The SGI-UK Glorious Life Choir who sing 'For the sake of Peace'. This is a great song written by Cory Josias, Veronica Turner, Malcolm Connell, Alex Golding and Howard Jones.

Update on Lizzie Obard from John Marder, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;quot;Lizzie woke up this afternoon. She has been looking at people and seems to hear things. The physio says she can move her limbs. She isn't fitting despite not being on the really heavy anti-convolsants. She&amp;#160; will continue to be sedated tonight and we think that tomorrow they will aim to bring her round properly and have her breathing herself. This is all such fantastic news and shows a massive turnaround since the awful things we were hearing on Friday. Of course there is still a long way to go in getting Lizzie better but what we have seen shows what all that Daimoku can do. Thank you so much to everybody and lets please keep that Daimoku rota roaring on for the fortnight and see fantastic proof. Thank you so much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;Jason and Karen&lt;br/&gt;</description>

                    <description>Karen has her own microphone! Questions on Men and Women, differences between Nichiren Daishonins Buddhism and other forms of Buddhism and is chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo a meditation? The  lecture/study talk is on the second page of Gongyo, the second part of Chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra. Getting harder not easier, this was a real challenge of confidence to see it through. We hope you enjoy it.
The show ends with &amp;quot;Panacea&amp;quot; from the Birthday Suit album by Bill from the Podsafe Music Network. If you like it, visit music.podshow.com. Podsafe Music Network is a great source of new music. Have a great week!</description>
