                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, June 13th, 2014 (Finale)</title>
                    <description>I hope they are watching. They'll see. This is my gift. My curse. And for a moment, I thought we were in trouble. I do wish we could chat longer, but... I'm having an old friend for dinner. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Now we are free. I will see you again, but not yet. Not yet. 

And like that... poof... they're gone. Good night, and good luck.

With Halo 5 still over a year away, Microsoft has put every consolation prize imaginable into one beautiful stopgap.

                    <description>The following is inspired by an actual conversation. "It can't be an X-Wing. Look at the nose, it's way too short." (But it clearly looks like the wings can go flap up into an X) "True, but look at the engines! There's only one engine on each side; the X-Wing has two each side!" (I mean, it's clearly not complete. Maybe they're adding more engines.) "But there's no room for more! Look how they're placed! It's not an X-Wing, but I bet it's from the same manufacturer." (The same... fictional manufacturer?) "Yeah, like, Star Wars Boeing."

                    <description>I used to think that I could not go on and life was nothing but a prehistoric song, but now I know the meaning of true love. I'm leaning on the T-Rex's arms.

If I can see it, then I can do it. If I just believe it, there's nothing to it.

I believe I can fly. I believe I can touch the sky. I think about it every night and day.
Spread my wings and eat people. I believe I can soar. I see me running through that science laboratory. I believe I can fly. I believe I can fly. I believe I can fly.

See I was on The Verge of breaking down. Sometimes silence can seem so loud. There are miracles in life I must achieve, but first I know it starts inside of me, oh.

If I can see it, then I can be it. If I just believe it, there's nothing to it. Hey, cause I believe in me, oh.

If I can see it, then I can do it. If I just believe it, there's nothing to it.

Hey, if I just spread my wings. I can fly. I can fly. I can fly, hey. If I just spread my wings. I can fly-eye-eye-eye. Hum, fly-eye-eye.And life was nothing but a prehistoric song.
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the T-Rex's arms.

If I can see it, then I can do it.

                    <description>"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time we look beyond DVD, beyond Blu-ray, and to a new physical format altogether. One that will meet our needs for years to come. The disc itself is wearing thin, no pun intended. Customers can't tell the difference between a CD and a Blu-ray at first glance. If the hold it the wrong, they can smudge or worse scratch the data away. Scratch. It. Away. And cloud? What's cloud? It's nothing tangible. My esteemed colleagues, what I hold today will last a lifetime. It's portable, you can hold it pretty much however you want, and it will stand the test of time."

"Excuse me, sir? That's a Super Nintendo cartridge."

"Exactly!"</description>

                    <description>"Anarchy! Anarchy! Anarchy!" screamed the voices in his head. The youthful trainer moves around erratically up, down, left, right. Going into his bag. Looking away from his bag. A rattata appears in a shrub near the Route 1 sign post. Out comes Squirtle, as if by instinct. "Democracy! Democracy! Tackle! Tackle!" The rattata is weak and prime for capture! "Anarhcy! Run away!" What?! The trainer thinks he might have a psychosis.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>In 1954 Godzilla made his feature-film debut. In 1962, he fought King Kong. In 1977 he took on The Avengers and Fantastic Four. In 1985, he sold Dr Pepper. In 1992 he played basketball with Charles Barkley. In 1998, he co-starred with Matthew Broderick in a romantic comedy by Roland Emmerich. And at some point in the timeline he took his son out for a loving stroll and taught him to use atomic breath.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Wednesday, May 14th, 2014 (iPhone 6 rumors)</title>
                    <description>But how will a new iPhone affect ABC's Selfie, you might ask? Wait, you're not asking that?

It's apparently inspired by My Fair Lady (much like how Clueless was inspired by Jane Austen's Emma). We don't know how to feel anymore. Dammit.</description>

                    <description>Alright we have over three million copies of 'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial' left in our warehouse. I think we need to accept the fact that the game just didn't play well. Screw it, let's just be honest with ourselves and say that the game sucked. It might even be one of the worst games I've ever played. You know what? It IS the the worst game I've ever played. I mean, how did we make something like that? It's atrocious! It's an embarrassment to Atari, Mr. Steven Spielberg, and all of your families! You should be ashamed! I'm sorry about that. I overreacted. Anyway, let's just fill a landfill in New Mexico with the rest of the copies and call it a night. Anyone want to get dinner?</description>

                    <media:description>Alright we have over three million copies of 'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial' left in our warehouse. I think we need to accept the fact that the game just didn't play well. Screw it, let's just be honest with ourselves and say that the game sucked. It might even be one of the worst games I've ever played. You know what? It IS the the worst game I've ever played. I mean, how did we make something like that? It's atrocious! It's an embarrassment to Atari, Mr. Steven Spielberg, and all of your families! You should be ashamed! I'm sorry about that. I overreacted. Anyway, let's just fill a landfill in New Mexico with the rest of the copies and call it a night. Anyone want to get dinner?</media:description>

                    <description>Elon Musk is looking to change transportation for everyone.
Wait, that's the description? That's... boring
Do you have a better idea?
Yeah, dude, let's do something on his whole "fighting the system" thing. He's taking on Big Aerospace and Big Auto...
Don't call me dude. I'm not your dude.
OK first off, you ARE a dude. Second, this sounds like that South Park "dude / buddy / guy" thing. Not original.
Do you enjoy hearing yourself talk?
I enjoy the all the praise and celebration that happens every time I do talk, yes. I know you wouldn't understand.

                    <description>Did you say the wrong thing to your significant other again? Was it something about their weight or a new outfit? Had trouble lying about liking his friends? Introducing the Polaroid Relation Camera! Next time you say the wrong thing, simply pull out the camera and snap a quick pic. Immediately following the shutter closing, 'La Vie en Rose' by Louis Armstrong begins to play. Before you know it, the two of you won't even remember what you were fighting about as you get lost in the soothing melody of this romantic tune. Coming this summer for $1999.</description>

                    <description>After great success with the release of the Grimace pogo stick and the Hamburglar jumprope, we are sad to announce that the McNugget Pedometer will end its run next week. While the team behind the device was and still is very proud of the device, the number of devices sold has not met our expectations. Apparently both the desire to consume the device upon purchase, as well as the "rotting" smell that tends to appear after about two days of owning the device has led to both critics and consumers being less than pleased with our product. We apologize for letting you, the customer, down. We would also like to extend a sincere apology to Mr. Ronald McDonald. We never intended to harm the McDonald name. However, we think that our next product, Hamburger Hammocks, will be a big hit!</description>

Since the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, astronauts have been forced to deal with eating food that does a real number on their digestive systems. The launch of Metamucil One marks a major step forward in the NASA astronaut diet. Thank you for your patriotism.</description>

For years, we’ve pondered how to bring you all the bold, exciting flavors of a traditional Subway sandwich, but with zero calories. After many trials, we’re excited to unveil this culinary creation to our restaurants. We cannot wait for you to come in and try it yourself! Come hungry, leave happy, but still hungry because you’re not physically putting anything in your stomach.</description>

                    <description>Commander Frizzle. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to establish a wireless signal (802.11n) to the subject's esophagus. To accomplish this, we recommend initial entry by way of the nasal cavity, as the mouth will have too much turbulence. If you run into trouble near the pharynx, it's acceptable (though not preferred) to divert course and deploy in the larynx. Plan on flying within the proximity for at least two weeks until Colonel Osmosis Jones can take over.</description>

                    <description>Sit back, relax, and let your supportive and loving internet service provider, Comcast, take care of you. In a matter of moments, we will begin the acquisition of your eyeballs. Do not fear, the process is actually quite simple. You won't feel a thing. Just think of it more as a partnership between our innovative company and your beautiful eyes. It works out well for all parties involved; you will gain top-of-the-line 20/20 vision and we'll get to beam advertisements for Comcast properties straight into your brain.</description>

                    <description>Is that a bird? A plane? Oh wait, yeah, that’s just a bird. I thought it might be Sad-Man, but he still hasn’t gotten out of bed. Perhaps today he’ll finally fight some crime! Oh, it appears he’s now putting on an Elliot Smith song and also watching Requiem for a Dream at the same time. Perhaps when it’s over he’ll get to work saving humanity. Nope, he just starting crying again and while shouting expletives about some girl named Jessica. Tune in next time for more adventures from Sad-Man!!</description>

                    <description>Android TV is old news. 'Musk See TV' is in. Introducing Elon Musk's vision for the future of television. After installing your 'Musk,' simply sit down on your couch and let the box do the rest for you. ‘Musk See TV’ will beam directly into your eyes, allowing you to tilt your head back and rest it against the wall without missing a second of programming. The box also comes with a drool catcher allowing you to enter an almost comatose state without getting saliva on your shirt. Once the box decides that you have reached the maximum amount of entertainment your mind can handle, it releases you from its visual grasp and allows you to continue on with the rest of your bland existence. Be warned though…once you start using the box, there is no stopping.</description>

                    <description>No one will even come close to filling the hole David Letterman is leaving in late night television. However, CBS will now be tasked with finding his successor. In order to help alleviate some of that stress, we at The Verge, have some suggestions for hosts and shows: 'Dropping the Ball with Steve Ballmer,' 'The Jeff Bezos Variety Hour,' 'Chris Ziegler: Car and Pizza Talk Live from Chicago,' 'Shane Says with Michael Shane,' 'Third Eye Blind Live,' and 'Four Hours of Ross Miller Dancing.' </description>

We didn’t act like you’d expect Mozilla to act. We didn’t move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We’re sorry. We must do better."</description>

                    <description>We at Amazon are so pleased with Fire TV.

                    <description>Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair California, where we lay our scene, from ancient patent infringement to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two technologically advanced foes. A pair of star-cross'd board members take their life;  Whose misadventured piteous overthrows. Do with their death bury their companies' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' ongoing legal battles, which, but their employees' end, nought could remove, Is now the never-ending traffic of our lawsuit; the which if you with patient jurors attend, what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend or possibly ban sales of the other's products.</description>

                    <description>Dan Seifert has vowed to eat his Blackberry Bold if Blackberry isn't profitable by 2016. While this may seem like a surprising bet to make, it's far from his first one. Previously, Dan vowed to eat his left foot if Google ever did more than just create a search engine, eat his own parents if the government ever breached our privacy, and eat his childhood memories if Facebook beat Myspace.</description>

We take the top story of the day from The Verge and make a 90 second video explaining what the news is, what the backstory is, and why this is important to our viewers. What was that? Yes, of course there will be goofs in it. Who do you think I am?</description>

                    <description>Two strangers. One room. Well they're not complete strangers. Let's start again. Two guys who work together, but don't usually hang out outside of the office. One room. What happens when they are told to kiss for the first time on camera? Some say it's going to be magical, some say it's going to be weird. Either way, it'll go viral.</description>

                    <description>I'm beginning to suspect that the mole is closer to me than I originally believed. Is it Ross Miller? He's been acting unusually normal lately. That's not like him. Or could it be Chris Ziegler? He recently moved to New York from Chicago and we all know that moles love deep dish pizza. Am I the mole? Have I forgotten my assignment? Oh man. I guess I'm the mole. Well, I better start snooping. Who do I work for though?</description>

                    <description>How am I supposed to live without you? That was the question posed by legendary musician Michael Bolton. Now, over 30 years after he shouted those words, Michael Bolton is back, but this time he's headed to the app store. In 'Heart Catcher,' players must collect broken hearts as they fall from the clouds. Collect all the pieces of the broken heart and love will be restored. Will Michael reunite with his true love or will he forever be lost without her?</description>

                    <description>Hi, this is NBA legend Charles Barkley. By now, many of you have probably heard about Shaquille O'Neal's plan to release a sequel to 'Shaq Fu.' Well looks like the ball isn't just in your court, friend. I would like to announce that I, too, am working on a sequel to my classic game, 'Barkley Shut Up and Jam!' Next year, 'Barkley II: Why Isn't Anyone Jamming With Me?' will hit stores exclusively for Super Nintendo. A lot of people have asked me, "Charles? How come you are releasing this game all by yourself and on a console that was discontinued in the late 90's?" My response is usually, "How about you put that basketball where the court is?" So buy my game and shoot some hoops with me. Please.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Hi, this is NBA legend Charles Barkley. By now, many of you have probably heard about Shaquille O'Neal's plan to release a sequel to 'Shaq Fu.' Well looks like the ball isn't just in your court, friend. I would like to announce that I, too, am working on a sequel to my classic game, 'Barkley Shut Up and Jam!' Next year, 'Barkley II: Why Isn't Anyone Jamming With Me?' will hit stores exclusively for Super Nintendo. A lot of people have asked me, "Charles? How come you are releasing this game all by yourself and on a console that was discontinued in the late 90's?" My response is usually, "How about you put that basketball where the court is?" So buy my game and shoot some hoops with me. Please.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>The man awoke not knowing who he was or where he was currently sitting. A cameraman, along with his trusty C100, waits patiently for the man to ready himself. The man stumbles to his feet, unsure of himself, but feeling the urge to present himself to the lens. "Who am I?" the man asks. "Um, Evan? Are you ok?" asks the cameraman. "You ate that giant sub and then sat on the floor and fell asleep." The man, now realizing who he is and what his purpose is, exclaims, "Oh! That happened again? Sorry about that. We ready to shoot?" And so another episode of 90 Seconds began.</description>

                    <description>We know how excited everyone is about our new P3 adult lunchables, but the fun doesn't end there. Introducing the full lineup of Oscar Mayer manchild lunches! We took our classic Pizza Lunchables and created new Kale Pizza Lunchables. Next up, we have the Ham and American Sub Lunchable, but now we've added Grey Poupon mustard to it because that's something we think adults like. It's the same exact sandwich, but now it comes with a more mature spread. Lastly, we have our Chicken Strip Lunchables. We haven't actually changed these at all, but now the kit comes with a portable glass of Merlot. Simply put, you're going to love being an adult!</description>

                    <description>Okay, so here's the pitch. You'll be playing a lab technician for some super science-y place — lots of future stuff — and you'll accidentally be working late at night and fall into this cloning machine. And you'll come out as both you and then a dog version of you. But then the machine breaks down and government agents know you're the only key left so they're hunting you down. But! They're looking for you... and also a dog version of you. So you two argue it out — yes, of course the dog speaks English, it's a clone version of you — and you two decide to dress up the dog as a human and enroll it in college. But like, a sexy college full of beautiful people. So now you're in hiding at a nearby university while G-men with guns and sunglasses hunt you down. It'll be great! We start shooting in a month and the director was a camera operator who worked on the Fast and Furious series, which is great, because he knows his way around films and in fact we were thinking about calling this Fast and Furry-ous because, well duh, your name would be Kyle "Nine" Fast. Get it? K-9? Okay, so just sign here and let's make movie history!</description>

                    <description>Adam Driver in final talks to play the villain in the new 'Star Wars' movie! David Fincher in early talks to direct the new Steve Jobs biopic! Now, Dieter Bohn is in middle, somewhat solid, but not enough to confirm talks play an undisclosed character in a new movie from a soon-to-be-announced high profile director. The film, set for release in 2026, will find Bohn's character faced with a difficult decision, one that will alter his life forever. Get ready for the feel-good-suspense-romcom-dramedy of the 2020's!</description>

Now, Dieter Bohn is in middle, somewhat solid, but not enough to confirm talks play an undisclosed character in a new movie from a soon-to-be-announced high profile director. The film, set for release in 2026, will find Bohn's character faced with a difficult decision, one that will alter his life forever. Get ready for the feel-good-suspense-romcom-dramedy of the 2020's!</media:description>

                    <description>Adrianne Jeffries was not able to write a description for 90 Seconds on The Verge as she was too busy preparing all of her Valentine's Day plans. Don't worry, she totally had planned all of this a while ago, but now she just needs to oversee everything. For instance, her dinner plans include reservations at that restaurant. You know, that really good one. What's the name again? Either way, it's all going to be amazing.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>We apologize for any errors you may have witnessed Adrianne Jeffries encounter today. To be completely honest, it's the end of the week and we're tired. So things didn't go exactly as we planned. Is it really that big of a problem? Come on! Why do you have to be like that? Why can't you just accept us the way we are? Whatever. Enjoy this episode. We'll see you on Monday.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Thursday, February 6th, 2014</title>
                    <description>Adi? Are you there? This is your bionic tooth, Denise. I am really worried about how quickly you are eating those pretzels. I can sense that at some point in the VERY near future, you are going to choke. Though it may simply be your destiny to choke to death on pretzels, I really think if you slowed down while consuming that bag of Rold Gold, you would have a much better chance of not dying. Please think about it. Please.</description>

                    <description>Greetings Verge 2014 friends! This is Ross Miller and I am writing to you from the year 2042. I am happy to announce that The Verge is still around and thriving in my world. Some things have changes though. For one, in 2033, Joshua Topolsky had his brain transferred into a robotic exoskeleton, making him the first sentient robot editor-in-chief. After the fall of New York City due to overpopulation in 2025, we moved the Verge office to Mars where we have since filled 50% of our staff with extraterrestrial beings. They're really nice. Also, in case anyone is wondering, Nilay Patel has replaced his blood with whiskey.</description>

                    <description>Unfortunately before we were able to let David know that a CEO was already chosen, he sent out the following letter to what he thought were his new employees at Microsoft: Hello everyone. My name is David Pierce and I am your new boss. I don't want to change too many things around the office, but I thought I would use this moment to announce some exciting news. First off, everyone must call me by my birth name, Chuck Bucklenuck. Secondly, Casual Fridays will now be limited to only hawaiian shirts. Finally, I will be changing the name of our company to 'Macrosoft.' I just want to try new things, ok? Anywho, thanks again for giving me this high paying job!</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Tuesday, January 28th, 2014</title>
                    <description>On the series premiere of 'Doctor Who,' the Doctor and his companion Clara find themselves in a government run society where agencies tap into millions of citizens' phone records, computers, and even smartphone apps every day. 

When the TARDIS is damaged during a routine wiretap (one the government, Torchwood, and U.N.I.T. all claim was to protect the safety of its citizens), the Doctor is forced to fix his prized machine before it's too late and he's forever stuck in this police state. Peter Capaldi also makes his debut in an outfit that makes the Doctor look like a magician from the 1920's.</description>

                    <description>Entry #11842: It has been a full eight minutes since the great blackout of Google+ and Gmail. No one could have predicted the catastrophic results of such an incident. Our service may be down, but our spirits are high… for now. Some say they heard there might be some Google down south. I find that hard to believe and if so, they don’t have enough Google for everyone. Our research team has been working tirelessly to find a cure, but our resources are scarce. We may have to switch back to Yahoo! Mail. If that is the case, God help us all.</description>

                    <description>If you could build a time machine, would you do it? If you could travel through space and time, would you do it? If you could alter the past, would you do it? If you could go back to that deli you went to for lunch today and not get that turkey club because the meat tasted funny, would you do it? Wouldn't it just be easier to take some Tums and then remember not to order that sandwich? Doesn't this seem like a massive waste of money?</description>

                    <description>Hello? Is anybody out there? My name is Nathan Cykiert. I was filming a daily news show with my friend, Chris Ziegler. It's only 90 seconds long, but we still manage to cram the top stories of the day into it. Anyway, I think we made some sort of wrong turn because now we're a little lost. If anyone can hear me, could you direct us back to the Las Vegas Convention Center? That would be very helpful. Also, do you know where I could get a pastrami sandwich around here?</description>

                    <description>Are you there God? It's Me, 1080p. I've been pretty down lately. I mean, I used be hip. I used to popular. Ok, I'm being a little overdramatic. I'm sorry. It's just that no one is talking about me anymore. These days, people only care about 4K. Ugh, what kind of name is that anyway? 4K? It just doesn't flow off the tongue like 1080p. I sound so much more bold and magical! Anyway, I hope you're enjoying CES and I'll talk to you when you get back.</description>

                    <description>You hop on your dune buggy, start the engine, and head deep into the desert. Your skin dries and cracks as the sun's rays hit your face. As your mouth dries and your head feels funny, you begin to wonder if you're ever going to make it. Just as hope begins to dwindle, you see it. The bright lights, the disgusting amount of people, and the overabundance of 4K products. You park your buggy, brush the sand off your hoodie, and smile. You have arrived at CES 2014.</description>

Perhaps I can direct you to a specialist for that headache you are getting after staring at error screens on our website. No? You're all set? Well if you need anything, just ask for Clippy. Why am I a paperclip and not something medical related? I don't know. People loved me on Office, but I don't think it's translating well to this site.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Hello. It appears you're trying to enroll in our healthcare program. Would you like some help? Perhaps I can direct you to a specialist for that headache you are getting after staring at error screens on our website. No? You're all set? Well if you need anything, just ask for Clippy. Why am I a paperclip and not something medical related? I don't know. People loved me on Office, but I don't think it's translating well to this site.</itunes:summary>

The machines are simply too fast, too strong, and too Android-y. We may have lost the battle, but we shall not lose this war. We must always remember the words of our mighty captain.

                    <description>We are sad to announce that after filming of today's episode commenced, Nathan Cykiert was killed. He  was leaving the '90 Seconds on The Verge' studio when a black cat ran out from under a desk, scaring Nathan and causing him to lose his balance. He attempted to catch himself, but instead smashed into a mirror, shattering it. Glass was everywhere as people ran to help Nathan, but it was too late. He had already picked himself back up and was going to grab a broom to clean up the mess he made. As he opened the maintenance closet, natural causes kicked in and Nathan died.</description>

                    <description>"I am so excited about 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now the newly announced 'X-Men: Apocalypse' that I just had to take this time to announce the next films in the series. Coming in 2018, fans can see 'X-Men: Post Apocalyptic Cleanup Time.' This will of course be followed by back-to-back films in late 2019 and early 2020 called 'X-Men: Can't The Avengers Take This One?' and 'X-Men: If We Must.' Finally, in 2024, the X-Men film everyone is waiting for will hit theaters. Get ready for 'X-Men: Based on the Story Push By Sapphire.'" —@BryanSinger</description>

                    <media:description>"I am so excited about 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now the newly announced 'X-Men: Apocalypse' that I just had to take this time to announce the next films in the series. Coming in 2018, fans can see 'X-Men: Post Apocalyptic Cleanup Time.' This will of course be followed by back-to-back films in late 2019 and early 2020 called 'X-Men: Can't The Avengers Take This One?' and 'X-Men: If We Must.' Finally, in 2024, the X-Men film everyone is waiting for will hit theaters. Get ready for 'X-Men: Based on the Story Push By Sapphire.'" —@BryanSinger</media:description>

We feel that the defendant had his chance after him and Jessica finished watching '10 Things I Hate About You.' There was a moment where it totes seemed like the right time, but then the defendant was all like, "I don't know what to do. What if she says no? That would be so embarrassing." And Jessica was all, "I guess he isn't interested in being more than friends." The crime shall be punishable by a minimum of ten years of regret.</description>

                    <description>Hey, how are you doing? I just wanted to let you know that I had an amazing time with you today. I really feel like we had something. I mean the sparks were really flying! Do you believe in love at first sight? Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but I haven't felt like this in years. Hopefully we can do this again sometime very soon. — Nathan</description>

"You do?"
"We do. That is why we are willing to give you $80,000,000,000,000,000 plus this batch of delicious chocolate cookies my wife made. What do you say?"
"Mmmmm... I think I'll wait a bit to see if I can get more. Thanks though! Can I still take a cookie?"

                    <description>Come one, come all to the greatest spectacle you've ever laid eyes on! For behind that curtain is a world of mystery and magic, mysticism and wonder, oddity and intrigue. I know many of you have traveled a great distance to make it to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, but I do promise you the wait will be worth it. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girl, I present to you, one of the great enigmas of the modern world. For no advancement in technology will help us better understand what it is that lies before us. Without further ado, I give you a truly audacious reveal and one that will live in your hearts and minds for the rest of your lives. Please put your hands together and help me welcome... *cough* I'm sorry, but my throat is a little dry from talking. Let me grab a glass of water to sooth my parched mouth and then I shall return!</description>

No night was complete without running up to the neighborhood store and picking up a copy of 'Mulan' and some chocolate covered cookie dough. Blockbuster is survived by its streaming rental service. The company will be buried in the same cemetery as Hollywood Video.</description>

                    <description>The Fifth of November is an important day to remember, but not because of Guy Fawkes Day. This date holds a special place in my heart. I shall never forget that evening in November of 1999. The N64 controller was practically slipping from my hands from the constant flow of sweat seeping from my palms. This was hour eight of Mario Party and I had yet to beat my fellow players in the fishing game. The center of my palm turned bloody and raw from reeling in my line. Alas, this was the final mini game of the night. My eyes turned bloodshot as the sugar rush I had previously been feeling faded. However at the last minute, I managed to find my courage from deep within my being as I cast out my line towards the treasure chest. Reel. Reel. Reel. I clenched my teeth and held back tears as I pulled my prize in. 3...2...1. At the final second, I pulled my gold ashore and reveled in all its glory. I was a winner.</description>

                    <description>Coming next summer, from the studio that brought you 'The Avengers' and 'Thor: The Dark World' comes the most anticipated movie of the decade....

It's 'The Hunger Games' starring Jennefire Lawrence and Al Roker. After being sent to the Capitol to report on a nasty storm, Al Roker gets swept up into the world of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Critics can't stop talking about the film, saying, "I really just wanted to watch the original film, but downloaded this by accident," and asking "isn't that the weatherman from the Today show?"</description>

If he can get his work done in time, it will truly be a happy Halloween.</description>

Hopefully. </media:description>

Remember Listerine PocketPaks? No, it's not that thin. Actually, the Wheat Thin example might have been a bit of an overstatement, but it's still pretty gosh darn thin. Let's just go with the pencil example.</description>

                    <description>Hoping to become the superhero we all need, Elon Musk has acquired a number of James Bond's gadgets, but he customized them with his own flavor. First up was the garotte watch. Musk purchased it for $1,200, but put another $18,000 in it so that the watch could shoot flames. Next were the dagger shoes. The shoes are traditional black leather and cost roughly $800, but Musk spent another $50,000 to make them shoot flames, plus another $30,000 on insurance. Lastly, Musk bought the original Golden Gun for $80,000, but unfortunately broke it while trying to make the gun shoot flames.</description>

                    <description>No description was written as the entire Verge staff left to go get pad thai after referencing it in today's episode. A description was then supposed to be written after said pad thai was eaten, but during dinner, an argument erupted over Star Trek Into Darkness. In the end, hurtful words were said and friendships were broken. Also, a table and some chairs were damaged in the altercation. We'll be back Monday with more 90 Seconds.</description>

                    <description>I'm going to create a restaurant called 'TGI THURSDAY' because people really don't appreciate this day as much as they should. Think about it — it's the day before the day before the weekend. You can plan out what crazy adventures you're about to get yourself into or dream about the dreams you'll be having on your couch while you watch a marathon of 'The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete'. Thursday marks the accomplishment of the near completion of the work week and dammit it deserves an reward! Also, I'd love to serve my kickin' sweet and sour chicken wings.</description>

                    <description>If you plant a seed, you can grow a tree.

If you grow a tree, you can collect apples.

If you collect apples, you can make pie.

If you make pie, you can create a business.

If you create a business, you can work long hours.

If you work long hours, you can find yourself away from home.

If you are away from home, you can not clean the house.

If you don't clean the house, you can attract rodents.

If you attract rodents, you can find your house taken over by human-like mice.

If you find your house taken over by human-like mice, you can battle the mice army for control of your property.

If you battle the mouse army, you can die.

Planting seeds will lead to your inevitable death.</description>

If you find your house taken over by human-like mice, you can battle the mice army for control of your property.

If you battle the mouse army, you can die.

Planting seeds will lead to your inevitable death.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>She was very cautious as she headed to work. This was no typical Friday.

"Meow," said the black cat that crossed her path.

"I'm working here!" said the construction worker whose ladder she walked under.

"Get your mirror out of my apartment!" said the woman throwing her ex-boyfriend's stuff out the window.

"Check out my new umbrella," said the man opening up his umbrella in the lobby of her office.

She made it to her desk safely. A grin grew on her face as she reveled in her accomplishment. Just to be safe, she threw one handful of salt over her shoulder...it was pepper. She grabbed the wrong bag this morning.

"Uh oh..." said the woman.</description>

I guess I'd rather just have the ability to fall asleep quickly. Maybe that will finally stop my insomnia.</description>

                    <description>He arrived not knowing what flavor of frozen drink he wanted. Soon he will know. Because what begins at the convenience store shall end there. And what ends there, shall once more begin. This is what happens. Men become thirsty. Men get lost. Men order that strange blue flavor when what they really want is the cola and cherry combination. Men's taste buds... are reborn.</description>

                    <description>The boy came prepared, his pockets stuffed with quarters and that powder that rock climbers use to keep their palms dry. He approached the machine confidently, but with caution. "Step forward and face me," said the machine. The boy reached into his pocket, hand quivering, and grabbed his first coin. It felt smooth and dirty. This wasn't the quarter's first rodeo. The boy took one single deep breath, taking in the smell of cotton candy and forgotton dreams that lingered in the dark corners of Pinball Pete's. He exhaled slowly, but confidently. This was no longer a boy. This was a man. A man ready to finally beat a game that had destroyed many saturday afternoons when he probably should have been doing something more physically active. And so he dropped the quarter into the slot and the game began.</description>

                    <description>Never take your eye off the card. I want you to keep looking right here! Whether I do this — whether I do that — I want you to keep your attention focused, right here. Don't let me distract you, and don't be fooled by my associate to the right. I'm going to play this straight with you, you're going to see the card you've selected, right here, you're going to see it jump from one hand to the other, all within the blink of an eye. Are you ready? Shall we do this? One... two... three...

This is the scene where the guy who's gone up to the cabin with his four friends suddenly realizes that the horrible creature has taken them all, right? And then like six seconds later it throws open the front door and comes after him. C'mon... try to be a little more creative, would ya?"

                    <description>Having dinner with a stranger is awkward enough. Try doing it with three murdered partygoers in the drawing room. 

I studied the guest at the other end of the table. He wasn't big on eye contact. Still... there was something familiar about him. I just couldn't place it.

At least the soup was good.</description>

The latest crime was accompanied by yet another note. "By now you may have surmised the predicament you find yourselves in," the butler read. "This evening did not happen by chance, and you are not the strangers you might think."

I traded glances with the other guests. I knew what kind of people they were, but had I met them? Not that I could remember.

"There is a connection amongst all of you," he said. "Discovering it is your only hope of escaping this house alive."</description>

                    <description>There was panic.

But really, what would you expect when one of the guests was found murdered? The reaction was normal. The things we discovered soon after, however, were not. The fact that the doors were locked. That the cars had been sent away. That none of us remaining would be able to leave the residence for the evening. 

"It is raining quite hard outside," the butler said. That detail was of little significance, but the note in his hand was another matter. It was a new message from our mystery host.</description>

                    <description>We arrived at the house, the lot of us invited by a host that still hadn't seen fit to reveal his — or her — identity. A simple card, written in a careful hand, and delivered by personal messenger. That was the only communication any of us had received.

As we milled in the hall, I looked at the other guests. Each of them striking in their own way, with easy smiles and guarded eyes. The eyes of people with secrets. This was going to be a most intriguing evening.</description>

Little did we know that this would be the day of the zombie pigeon invasion.</description>

                    <description>Everything was red.

I opened my eyes slowly, wincing as the world slowly came into focus. The emergency lights were flashing; sparks sputtered from a broken panel to my right. Then I remembered. The impact.

I pulled myself up. Somewhere in the background the computer was warning about a hull breach, spouting the emergency quarantine protocol. It was a Delta Three priority — but to be honest I didn't really care at the moment.

Bang. At the door. Whatever had gotten onto the ship was outside, right now. At least the lockdown would buy me some time.

The computer chimed. "Override authentication accepted. Have a nice day."

I always hated machines.</description>

                    <description>This wasn't supposed to happen. 

Thump-thump.

According to the old timers, the station had been abandoned years ago. So what was the rhythmic signature I was seeing on the scan — the one echoing on the overheads?

Thump-thump.

There shouldn't have been enough fuel for the pod to separate from the station. Much less propel it on a course straight at our port side.

Thump-thump.

I hailed all frequencies. Ran the biometric sweep. Nothing. It had been so long since we'd slept I'd be inclined to think I was imagining things. If it wasn't for that constant, unrelenting heartbeat.

Thump-thump.

The pod grew closer, accelerating. There was no stopping it now.

Impact.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>This wasn't supposed to happen. 

Thump-thump.

According to the old timers, the station had been abandoned years ago. So what was the rhythmic signature I was seeing on the scan — the one echoing on the overheads?

Thump-thump.

There shouldn't have been enough fuel for the pod to separate from the station. Much less propel it on a course straight at our port side.

Thump-thump.

I hailed all frequencies. Ran the biometric sweep. Nothing. It had been so long since we'd slept I'd be inclined to think I was imagining things. If it wasn't for that constant, unrelenting heartbeat.

Thump-thump.

The pod grew closer, accelerating. There was no stopping it now.

                    <description>The initial scans weren't that promising — just an array of corridors and storage hangers, once busied with the citizenry but long since abandoned. It looked like the operation was going to be a bust after all, but then I noticed it: a blip. Nothing more than a shimmer, really; a tiny artifact in the digital latticework. It was minor enough that most wouldn't even notice it — and I imagine that was the idea. You're never going to cloak something from a phase scan completely. The trick's in masking what traces you do leave behind, making them seem as innocuous as possible. Whoever was behind this one was good. They were very, very good. But then again, so was I.

I dialed in the settings and the snow fell away. There, on the edges of the station was the last remaining escape pod. And there was something inside. Something alive.</description>

                    <description>The truth is, it never occurred to me that there were additional resources to call upon in the first place. The mining ships had gone adrift long ago, and the ever-orbiting lunar station was simply a relic... a reminder of times past, not something that could actually be our salvation. But surprises abound, even in the Outer Stretches. It turns out that the blinking distress signal wasn't just a one-way transmission. No, it was an uplink as well, and that meant one thing: contact.</description>

                    <description>"Mostly I saw myself looking back. A gelatinous version of me, anyway, full of rage and empty calories. I was hiding in the car as they marched by. He looked up at me, as if he knew. As if he had my memories and recognized the car. We looked eyes - or what I at least think were his eyes, it's kind of hard to tell, he was admittedly a bit deformed and didn't come out as 1-to-1 as I had maybe thought. He never let on to his troops. He just kept marching. As soon as the coast was clear, I turned on the ignition and sped away."</description>

We looked eyes - or what I at least think were his eyes, it's kind of hard to tell, he was admittedly a bit deformed and didn't come out as 1-to-1 as I had maybe thought. He never let on to his troops. He just kept marching. As soon as the coast was clear, I turned on the ignition and sped away."</media:description>

                    <description>Squeak, squeak.
The bell rings.
The crowd sings.
My human waves his hand in the air.
Squeak. Click. Click. Squeak.
A fish.
One fish.
My body is a barrel racing, breaking the thin line between my aquatic home and the fresh air of human.
Whooooooooooosh.
A hope, my equilibrium. A flip. I remember my mouth agape, grabbing the fish from my human's hand with the precision only months of repetition can accomplish.
Splash.
The crowd sings
The bell rings. 
One more time.</description>

                    <description>It was the kind of thing you'd hear at the short end of a long day, when the city was thick with the stench of broken promises. Out on the streets, a hundred faces all melted into one, and that's the way I liked it. It was safer that way. You let people in, you let people through... well, that's how people got hurt. That's how people got dead, and I'd had my fill of regret. I'd had my fill a long, long time ago.

                    <description>I can see the future. A land where taps have been exiled, swipes outlawed, and the best way to control is to simply see. Or to move one's hand in the air — a pantomime of interactivity — while the all-knowing, all-controlling Great Big Brain recognizes sheer human will. The gifts of days yet to come? The technological bounty of new millennia? Perhaps... or maybe it's just Thursday.</description>

The bird blinked. Twice. "Well. I am a talking owl."</description>

                    <description>"The Temple Run. To the unaware masses that I see every day on the bus, it's just a silly mobile game to pass time. I shudder every time I think about it. Temple Run had a much different meaning to me.

"My memory here gets a bit hazy. I know that the Big Face, in a rare moment or compassion, warning us of the dangers in his temple. (Now that I think about it, he was never being "compassionate." He was *boasting* — indulging in some psychopathic soliloquy like a Bond villain in the eleventh hour.) 

"My partner went in first — he with the special pendant of protection. I know that he chose to go up at the white laser, lost his protection in the password room, and ultimately succumbed to the spirit of a temple guard in the dark forest. 

"I don't remember questioning the phantasmagorical nature of any of it. Of a giant stone face who relished in the anguish of the young. Of a dark forest that grew in a temple only partially obscured. Of a lost trinket whose origins would place it somewhere in the Arctic. At that moment, nothing seemed weird. All I remember now is grabbing the trinket and running. Running fast, past the rubble and blood and sweat that signified failures of my predecessors. I just kept running..."</description>

                    <description>"The Jovial Man asks for our dreams, what we want to do should we ever escape this hell — knowing full well that the four of us may not survive long enough to miserably miss that dream (and knowing two of us definitely will miss that opportunity in about fifteen minutes' time).

"The Temple Games. Ahead of us were silly prefaces and falsified tales of lore by the Big Face. Long, elastic strings stretching out from an unforeseen pipe above, tethering us to a little square. Up we jump, higher than we ever have before. Up to that makeshift ceiling where we reach in, blindly, hoping for treats and no tricks of malfeasance. All we ever got was 60 seconds. Blind faith grabbing trinkets, back down into a bucket, back up again.

"One down, two to go. I am two games from knowing my short-term fate, and what felt like eons to knowing where my life would lead from there.

"Why is my partner in a boat... that has wheels?"</description>

                    <description>"'Tell them how they'll have to do it today...' The Big Face speaks but his bass words are muffled by the euphonic woodwinds and my own fears.

""If there is a bottom to the moat, I have never seen it. As hard as I try to peer, to gaze, to focus, all I can see is fog below. Dipped into the fog like donuts to steaming hot coffee, a row of rings - 'ancient rings,' the Big Face calls it - hanging by a vine.""

"'When Kirk gives the signal...' the five most horrifyingly scary words, six syllables. The Jovial Hosts asks Big Face if he's ready. 'Yessssssss,' he lazily draws out, in a manner that suggests his bloodlust would fit well only among the most sadistic of mortal souls.

"'On your mark, get set,...' I don't hear 'go,' but I do see the splashes. My companion goes first, followed soon by me. As I wait, though, I see a Silver Snake struggle, trapped in a harness of three rings, his arms sifting wildly through the mist. I never saw him make the other ring. In fact, I never saw him again in all the years since the event - though admittedly, I haven't been actively looking to recount my experience or seek painful reminders."</description>

                    <itunes:summary>"'Tell them how they'll have to do it today...' The Big Face speaks but his bass words are muffled by the euphonic woodwinds and my own fears.

""If there is a bottom to the moat, I have never seen it. As hard as I try to peer, to gaze, to focus, all I can see is fog below. Dipped into the fog like donuts to steaming hot coffee, a row of rings - 'ancient rings,' the Big Face calls it - hanging by a vine.""

"'When Kirk gives the signal...' the five most horrifyingly scary words, six syllables. The Jovial Hosts asks Big Face if he's ready. 'Yessssssss,' he lazily draws out, in a manner that suggests his bloodlust would fit well only among the most sadistic of mortal souls.

"'On your mark, get set,...' I don't hear 'go,' but I do see the splashes. My companion goes first, followed soon by me. As I wait, though, I see a Silver Snake struggle, trapped in a harness of three rings, his arms sifting wildly through the mist. I never saw him make the other ring. In fact, I never saw him again in all the years since the event - though admittedly, I haven't been actively looking to recount my experience or seek painful reminders."</itunes:summary>

                    <description>"They stood next to me and I to them. There were 12 of us in all, including myself and my trusted companion, each pair representing both a creature and a primary color. Our yellow iconography matching the very helmets that kept our heads safe and our vision focused to only what's in front of us. There was never any rhyme or reason to the selection, it was just something used to both identify and marginalize us. A reminder that we as corporeal vessels were replaceable.

"I remember waiting backstage. Asking, begging, pleading for anything but these shorts. 'They're a hindrance,' I retorted, when asked why I would instead prefer pants to baggy khaki shorts. Okay, maybe it wasn't a hindrance, but it was something to that effect - my memory, not too surprisingly, is more educated than my past self.

"Alas, the shorts were to stay, as were the helmets, as were the colorful shirts with gold insignia. The Big Face demanded it as such. Part of his big ritual, they said. Behind his ruby-red eyes was something that suggested he had been crossed this way before but there was nary a soul alive that say what happened. So we did as the Big Face decreed, lest we, too, find out what happened to the others who protested too loudly."

"A jovial man enters — He who is allowed to address the Big Face. 'Are you ready?' he asks. 'Let's rock,' the Big Face bellows. And so we began."</description>

                    <description>It's an unending battle, passed down from generation to generation. The only thing that truly changes is the name. The quickening? The reckoning? Does it matter?

                    <description>Lasers, you know? It's like every time you turn around, they're beaming your priceless cultural artifacts to the moon. Then as soon as you get them to stop, they're taking naked pictures of you and showing everyone at the TSA. What's next? Lasers that kick the girl next to you in class and then disappear, so you get blamed for it? Lasers that steal your keys, and beam them to space? And here we thought lasers were just good for being the best gun in Goldeneye for Nintendo 64. Ugh.</description>

"Uhhh, this your captain again. It appears that the aircraft itself is the one that's breaking the 'no smoking' rule. I apologize for the witch hunt. We will now be doing an emergency landing so that the aircraft can smoke in peace. Please make sure your seat belt is fastened and that all electronic devices are turned off. Especially those playing Chip Chain. I know it's addicting, but it can wait 10 minutes."</description>

After the Millneium Falcon attempts to cross the Great Barrier at the edge of the galaxy, C-3PO and R2-D2 develop "godlike" psychic powers which threaten the safety of the crew.

S01E02: The Carbonite Maneuver (Director: Zack Snyder)

The Millenium Falcon is menaced by a gigantic ship whose Bounty Hunter commander condemns the crew to being sealed by carbonite. Han employs an unorthodox strategy to save the ship.

S01E03: Operation: Exterminate! (Director: Zack Snyder)

The Millenium Falcon arrives at Skaro — the home of Han Solo's brother, Lan — and discovers that the entire planet has been infested with large cyborgs that have plunger-like things for weapons, because really at this point, why not make this a Doctor Who crossover, as well?</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy birthday to Tom Waits, a great American actor known for his role as Doc Heller in Mystery Men, Radio DJ Silva in &lt;i&gt;Bear Skin: An Urban Fairytale&lt;/i&gt;, and an uncredited drunken bar owner in the 1981 classic &lt;i&gt;Wolfen&lt;/i&gt;. He's also reportedly a musician, known famously for contributing to the Shrek II soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Just kidding, we love Tom Waits and &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; hope he has a sense of humor but whatever he probably will never see this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** It's also the 40th anniversary of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble"&gt;The Blue Marble&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a role we're pretty sure that Tom Waits made famous.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Quote Oscar Wilde, "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth." With that in mind, and in honor of the anniversary of his death a little over a century ago, we have decided to put a David Pierce mask on top of one of our interns. Let's see what happens.</description>

                    <description>It's tomorrow. You know, the day after yesterday. Billions of days after a yesterday far, far away, and at least a couple of days after the yesterday-that-shall-not-be-named. It's also the day before the day after tomorrow, which is millions of days before future tomorrow - a place we'd like to visit. But we can't visit, because we've passed it. We've flown by so many tomorrows that we've arrived at yesterday, and back again - the future of the past, of the future. And boy are our arms tired. So let's take a break and chat, today, for 90 seconds on the verge of eternity.</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We've made it, people. All the hard work has paid off. Blood, sweat, and tears for one hundred episodes of daily news, delivered by the dashing staff of The Verge, and it's brought us here. To syndication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about it for a minute. The Samsung vs. Apple case in reruns for the next ten years. The Huawei spy probe every night at 5:30, 6:00, and 6:30. IKEA's LED bulbs right between &lt;i&gt;The King of Queens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Everybody Loves Raymond&lt;/i&gt;. These will be our golden years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there will be compromises. Cable wants us to cut it down for length, so reruns will air under the title "83 Seconds on The Verge." And because of a minor typo in the contract, episodes will run in reverse chronological order, skipping Fridays altogether. But the spirit of the first run will still be there, and hey, now we can leave Nilay's rants unedited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't worry. We'll be back for more. The royalty checks and mass market distribution will only renew our dedication and strengthen our hunger for perfection. On to 101.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Monday, November 12, 2012</title>
                    <description>Hey it's me. Your computer. You seem so far away! You haven't used me in forever, tell me why you gotta stray. Don't you want to watch Sam Sheffer? Telling you the news?

Remember all the things we shared, like Apple's patent spats? BlackBerry announcements (in January), and Star Wars in a theater near you? I'd hate to see you get all heated, if suddenly they got deleted.

Want to keep me calm and stable? Perkier, more able? To keep me happy in every way, I need you to watch these 90 Seconds TODAY.</description>

                    <description>We filmed 90 Seconds on The Verge while filming On The Verge, which is about as close to video Vergeception as we're gonna get.

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Monday, November 5, 2012</title>
                    <description>Last year, I quit my job at AOL and Engadget to join a small internet publishing startup and help build what would become The Verge and Vox Media.

But then my aspirations grew into something more. Something special and spiritual in nature. Some would call it a higher power. Some might even call it a high. What was I saying? Man, I'm hungry.

My name is Ross Miller and I'm asking you to write me in as your next President of the United States of America.

Middle class? Gone. High class and low class, too. Or is it top and bottom classes? It doesn't matter. Who likes classes? Not students, that's for sure — or as I'd like to say, future Ross Miller voters. Which brings me to my point about eliminating school altogether... but that's for another time.

Foreign policy. I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. Hell, I've even seen nine versions of Blade Runner — and I've read the unabridged "Good and Bad Parts" version of S. Morgenstern's The Princess Bride. No one else can say those things. No one, that's who.

Global warming? Sounds awesome, this sweater is itchy. Gravity? If NASA can't upgrade it from theory to fact, how can we trust what it says about the moon?

Then there's net neutrality. Which is a thing, apparently.

Friends, we live in uncertain times. And only I can promise you complete uncertainty — but hey, at least that's a sure thing.

Adi Robertson can come. And Nilay Patel. And sure, Paul Miller, too. Hi.

My name is Ross Miller, and damnit, I approve this message and thirty thousand more. #RossMiller2012</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, November 2, 2012</title>
                    <description>Dear friends,

There's been a rumor going around for some time. One that we here at 90 Seconds thought if we ignored, it would just go away. "Why," we said to ourselves and no one else in particular, " would anyone ever think this falls within the realm of reality?" Still, we now have thought aloud to ourselves and absolutely no one else in particular, it's a persistent rumor. Still let's adress it now.

We do not film in front of a green screen. It's not a blue screen either. There is no elaborate tracking to keep a persistent illusion that the host is in a studio when in fact he's in a tiny box with a pastel-colored drape behind him. That's just silly — holodecks are way easier for production.

Thank you and have a nice day.</description>

                    <description>"Fantasy sports ball? Back in my day I used to hat trick all the hoops with my sportstick and one time I even tackled a guy and got an orange card for using my ankle in a fight. They threw me in the penalty corner for the fifth period and I had to miss the pseudofinal round of Pretzel Bowl XIVIV."

But seriously... you should check out Isaac's role as The Weather Man in SB Nation's Fantasy Football show Keepers — trust us, you physically can't miss him.</description>

                    <description>Noted Rush fan extraordinaire (and expert photographer) Michael Shane wanted to write the description for today, but then remembered he had tickets to see Geddy Lee wailing at the Barclays Center. It's a shame, really, but it's just as well — he probably would've just pasted the lyrics to "Subdivisions" twice over, and clearly the "90 Seconds..." descriptions are not the place for random prose and poetry.</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Not all horseface bipeds have murderous intent. There is a softer, gentler side to the group. Then again, sometimes that side is all a ruse, a way to catch humans off guard and strike when the moment arises. That's the thing with horsefaces: you can never be sure what they're feeling. They have no "tell," so to speak. Thus, never look a biped horseface in the mouth &amp;mdash; it won't do you any good.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride. Every horse thinks its own pack heaviest. For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for want of a horse the man was lost. This above all: beware the horseface killah.</description>

                    <description>"The North Wind and Marty Moe were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.

"Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then Marty Moe shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak.

"And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that Marty Moe was the stronger of the two. But none were a match for ol' Horseface Killah and his kin.

                    <description>Do you know the legend of Horseface Killah? Throughout history, he has taken many forms. In modern times, however, he is a biped creature with the power to shapeshift at will. There is only one constant: his head is that of a light brown mare. In art, he is typically depicted between 5'7" and 6'5" depending on the dramatic effect required. He rarely lets his presence known to his victim until the moment he's ready to strike, although witnesses report seeing him stalking for up to one-point-five minutes prior to attack, give or take, at most.</description>

Then they came for Vox Executive Producer Kyle Kramer, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't Kyle Kramer.

Then they came for the rest of Vox studio, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a studio. That's silly. A studio is a room, not a human.

Then they came for me,  and there was no one left to host the show.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Wednesday, October 10, 2012</title>
                    <description>Do you know what fear is? It isn't something to take lightly. Look up — what do you see? Nothing; the sky is dark. But it isn't empty, oh, no. Somewhere (far beyond what your feeble eyes can perceive) waits a dragon, its jagged legs slicing the vacuum of space. You have lived for decades on that blistered rock you call a home, the product of millions of years of evolution. It has existed for only a few years, sprung forth ex nihilo like Athena from Zeus' brow. And yet it is greater than you, and it will see things you will never see. And someday, soon, it is coming home. Know that, dear reader, and know fear — or wonder.

Yes, we also have tablets.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Tuesday, October 9, 2012</title>
                    <description>October 9th. Tenth month, ninth day. Ten times nine is 90. Ninety... seconds... on The Verge. It's episode 75, which is divisible by 3, 5, 15, and 25. You know what else is divisible by 3, 5, and 15 (but not, in the interest of transparency, by 25)? That'd be 90 — as in, 90 Seconds on The Verge. It's somehow all related, and yet, it's also not. The numbers add up, but in another way, this is all just scribbles of a mad man looking to write a description for an episode... an episode, of course, of 90 Seconds on The Verge.</description>

                    <description>Fun fact: in the Wikipedia article for "Mobile phone form factor," the third entry (behind brick and bar) is "taco" — as in, the Nokia N-Gage looks like a taco. Think about that for a second: the "taco" phone form factor has more prominence than flip, slide, swivel, and watch. This is the N-Gage's legacy.</description>

                    <description>Well, it took us four times as long as normal to find our way to the Verge Studios today (thanks a lot, iOS Maps), but we made it. And just in time, because it turns out there's lots to talk about. Like all the news you missed while you waited in line for an iPhone 5, or while you were on a plane that won't let you use your cell phone... for now. Or while you were jumping for joy because Verizon finally let Google's latest sweets out of its coffers, meaning our great national nightmare is finally over. We know you've gotta get down on Friday, so we're going to give you all the news in a minute and a half. It's 90 Seconds on The Verge, It's The Last Day of Summer So Go Be Outside Edition.</description>

                    <description>It's always disappointing that we don't have more options to show off the beating heart of The Verge. The support staff. The unsung heroes. The ones who dress up way better than anyone else despite never having to be on the front lines. This all feels like a shame — so for all those reasons, here's our wonderful product database manager William Savona filling in as today's host!</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Tuesday, September 18, 2012</title>
                    <description>It's arbitrary milestone day! 90 Seconds on The Verge hit the big six-zero, which by our calculations means we're about 90 minutes old. 90 minutes of 90 Seconds feels like something nice and even — plus we're now officially a feature-length film! Sure, it's a rather repetitive film that borrows rather obviously from a few other cinematic masterpieces (The Princess Bride, Star Wars), but hey, at least we hatched SB Nation's Dan Rubenstein out of an egg during our halcyon minutes.</description>

                    <description>A web video series?

"That's right. When I was your age, holographic projections were called web video. And this is a special web video series. It was the web video series my father used to play for me when I was sick, and I used to play it for your father. I'm gonna play it for you."

Has it got any sport in it?

"Are you kidding? Standing, talking, torture, revenge, bearded giants, chases, escapes, forced dialog, miracles..."

Doesn't sound too bad, I'll try to stay awake.

"Oh, well, thank you very much, very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. It's only 90 seconds anyway."</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, September 14th, 2012</title>
                    <description>Futurama, Season 03, Episode 12. "Insane in the Mainframe." Fry sits down at a table in the cafeteria of the HAL Institute for Criminally Insane Robots — uncomfortably between Abe Lincolnbot and a Pay 'n' Chew vending machine. At the head of the table, the Mad Hatterbot — with a 5/3 label on its hat that's clearly way more efficient than the Mad Hatter's "10/3 hat" from the original Alice in Wonderland. "Change places!" he screams over a cup of spilled oil and they do, all except Fry. The frustration and sense of hopelessness bubbling up — his fingernails going blunt digging into the plastic tray — before the Hatterbot repeats his decree and all machinery follows suit.

That's kind of what happened today, with me controlling the cameras and The Verge producer Creighton DeSimone hosting. "Change places!" Happy Friday.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Wednesday, September 12, 2012</title>
                    <description>From WVRG in New York, it's 90 Seconds on The Verge, distributed by Vox Media. I'm Ross Miller. Today on our program, we have the story of a certain large technology company who this week announced the latest updates to its handheld computer business. Act One, the iPhone Growth Spurt. In Act Two, the Less Connected, we'll focus on the iPod and how it's evolved over the hours today. Finally, Act Three, And Now For Something Completely Different, where we visit Sony and its completely unrelated announcement of new cameras. It's 90 Seconds on The Verge. I'm Ross Miller. And let's just get to it. Here's David Pierce.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Monday, September 10, 2012</title>
                    <description>Last week's gathering of The Verge staff from around the globe brought together many things. Ideas, friendships... diseases. Mostly the latter, in fact — think of it as a cross between Outbreak, Contagion, and "Genesis" from season seven of Star Trek: The Next Generation.

And as we each continue to fight our own battles for the betterment of our respective upper respiratory tracts, the show, as they say, must go on.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, September 7, 2012</title>
                    <description>What a crazy week, both for the industry at large and for The Verge on a personal level. Major turning points for numerous companies (Nokia, Amazon, Motorola). Major hints at the week's ahead (Apple, HTC). And for The Verge, a chance to fly in (almost) everyone on staff to laugh together, learn together, and of course, find new purpose in this silly "thing" we call life.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Thursday, September 6, 2012</title>
                    <description>It is a typical summer day in New York City. One man stops in a midtown Manhattan crosswalk, staring down an endless avenue. All around him, human beings lope along the sidewalks, passing in and out of each other's interpersonal orbits. They flow down the outstretched canyon of concrete and steel, a constantly evolving protoplasm of collective consciousness — and yet, individuality. The whole scene springs forth and hits him, a spontaneous choreograph sitting precariously amid infinite and uncaring entropy. In this moment, he is happy — more awake than the world around him. "What a beautiful, terrifying, spectacular thing," he thinks.

And yet, at the very moment he articulates this feeling in his mind, the magic vanishes. The scattered colors before him congeal into the familiar patterns of ergonomic contemporary life. He pulls out his smartphone, snaps an incredible high-resolution, optically-stabilized photo, and uploads it to Instagram. All is lost in translation.</description>

                    <description>We're at episode 51 of 90 Seconds on The Verge, and although we don't have 51 new smartphones to share with you — we do have five from today's events. Continuing our important guests trend for the week, we have Microsoft stalker Tom Warren fresh from London. He might be holed up in an unnamed location in New York, for fear of reprisals over his latest scoops, but we managed to smuggle him out in time to cover the day's news. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the English accent.</description>

                    <description>We're halfway to our centennial. Episode 50 of 90 Seconds on The Verge. This isn't the only milestone we'll be celebrating soon, but it definitely warranted flying in a few very important guests for an all-star week! (That's right, absolutely no other reason they're all here in New York but to stand in front of our cameras and look pretty.) We couldn't help but start with our Elder Statesman (and current Amsterdam resident) Thomas Ricker. Okay. Let's make history.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>We're halfway to our centennial. Episode 50 of 90 Seconds on The Verge. This isn't the only milestone we'll be celebrating soon, but it definitely warranted flying in a few very important guests for an all-star week! (That's right, absolutely no other reason they're all here in New York but to stand in front of our cameras and look pretty.) We couldn't help but start with our Elder Statesman (and current Amsterdam resident) Thomas Ricker. Okay. Let's make history.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, August 31, 2012</title>
                    <description>It's Friday, and that means not a whole lot of news happened today. But don't worry, because a lot of news about next week happened. 90 whole seconds of news. And we're going to talk about it. To a camera. While video of things related to that news also plays. There will be some upbeat music. Then maybe we'll try and wrap things up with a joke, but we're not going to try too hard. Hell, we might not even try at all. Try not to stress out so much.

This is 90 Second on The Verge.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Thursday, August 30, 2012</title>
                    <description>It's that time of year again — can you smell it in the air? It's laptop season! The world is gathered in Berlin for the glorious release of one hundred and forty million new laptops (all numbers approximate). We've welcomed Paul from off the internet, and shared with him all of this week's new wares. And oh, what wares! In addition to the slew of laptops, today brought word that Google and Apple are engaged in some very high-level discussions about patents. We also got a look at what Bezos and co. have been up to when they're not watching episodes of Parks and Rec on Amazon Instant. All that and more, from your internet-free pal Paul Miller. And all in 90 seconds! He's so efficient, that Paul.</description>

Oh sure, I write to often &amp;mdash; as I have been wont to do from the start, a letter that's always 90 seconds in length (or so my editor likes to let me pretend). And of course, the child has many daddies that are all there taking care of him. And even more so, having David Pierce as a surrogate daddy is all well and good... but I just miss the little guy so much. Maybe he'll fly in for a daytrip in Berlin. That'd be nice. He looks so good today without me there. I'm so proud. But oh, &lt;em&gt;oh&lt;/em&gt;, the longing.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>Happy Monday, readers — we're glad to see you've made it through this emotional weekend. It's hard to believe, but the long judicial ordeal that was Apple v. Samsung is over. Fortunately for Samsung, the gadget maker has IFA 2012 and a new Windows 8 tablet to distract from the pain of what can only be characterized as a thorough loss. Meanwhile, citizens of the world celebrated the life of Neil Armstrong, the first human being to walk on the moon. That and more in today's 90 Seconds on The Verge.</description>

                    <description>This week was either the calm before the storm, or the eye of the hurricane, or that moment when you're just about to jump out of the plane and you're only about 46 percent sure you packed your parachute right. Next week brings IFA, followed by events from Nokia, Amazon, and Motorola. Then, rumor has it we'll be seeing a new iPhone. But that's not to say this week wasn't packed with news. Even on this summery Friday, Samsung vs. Apple took a new international turn, Amazon gave Prime members to watch this weekend, and Microsoft teased its tablet caveman-style. So take a minute and a half to soak it all in during this week's final 90 Seconds on The Verge.</description>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Thursday, August 23, 2012</title>
                    <description>Big news, folks: we've decided to change the Verge logo. Picture it with us: a square made of squares, each a different color. Next to it, our name, with the letters combined in weird ways that are going to make kerning fanboys crazy... sorry, what? Microsoft already did that? Oh. Well, at least we've got Nilay Patel to fill us in on everything that happened today, from logos to apps and everything in between. While the Samsung vs. Apple jury deliberates, here's today's tech world in a minute and a half — it's 90 Seconds on The Verge.

Oh, and if Microsoft comes out with something called "90 Seconds on Microsoft," you be sure and let us know. Those guys steal all of our ideas.</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Dan! Hey, Dan! Hey, new guy! How are you doing? Enjoying your first week? We're glad to hear... what's that? Hazing? No, we don't do hazing. That's uncouth. We're a civilized organization. But hey, since you're here, could you just stand on the 'x' for us. Yep, that's great. Actually, a little bit to the left. Perfect. Now stand up straight. Smile a little more, it makes you sound better. Happier. Act like you want to be here. (&lt;i&gt;Hey Robbie, can we move that light a bit? There we go.&lt;/i&gt;) Okay, give us just one second... just focusing... okay, great! Alright, look at camera one and start with "Hey this is Dan..."&lt;/p&gt;

LTE service activated in the presence of the Queen. I've seen two major companies let a jury of nine civilians decide the fate of their intellectual property and millions — if not billions — of dollars in damages. I've watched magazines rise and fall as sands in the hourglass fall.</description>

                    <description>This episode is dedicated to James Edward Franco. Born April 19th, 1978, the multihyphenate first came to prominence with the 1999 cult classic Freaks and Geeks. He has since been credited over 75 roles as an actor while simultaneously trying his hand at writing and directing. Expressing a strong interest in continuing education, Franco has at various times enrolled at UCLA, Columbia University, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, Brooklyn College, North Carolina's Warren Wilson College, and Rhode Island School of Design. He recently re-teamed with Spider-Man director Sam Raimi for Oz: The Great and Powerful, which is due in theater next year.

Needless to say, Franco has led an incredibly interesting and accomplished life. None of this, however, makes up for that awful Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 video.</description>

                    <description>Little known fact about Josh Topolsky: he's really, really tall. Okay, that might not the best way of introducing an episode, but we thought the world at large would like to know that all tripods required extra platforms to film today's episode. And the camera operators, too. Very well known fact about Ross Miller: I'm clearly filling up random nonsense in these descriptions and this has been going on for some time now. The good news is, if you want actual news, knowledge, and entertainment, we have just the episode for you!</description>

                    <description>People of the world: this is not a GIF. But wait, don't leave! It's something more. It's something better. It's a long-form GIF with an audio component. One that's capable of high-quality visuals but loads more gradually, less choppy. A GIF you can jump around in. And it has a name that isn't hotly debated. Now, you may be worried about this Brave New World of "video" — that's what we call it, which is some foreign term for "GIF with enhancements." Thomas Houston has taught us so much.</description>

                    <description>Few people in this world know there is a dark, dark side to Ellis Hamburger. What began as any other pre-taping rehearsal soon took a bleak turn.
As with any of the prep work we do, host and writer lock themselves in a sound proof room and go through the topics and script, tweak to match the host's needs and personality. Everything was going so cheery until one segment caught his eye. One topic. One newsbrief that he just could not believe would pass before him.
Filled with what could only be described with pure, unadulterated rage and vitriol, Ellis flipped a table so hard that the legs pierced the ceiling, a position in which the unfortunate piece of furniture remains to this day. Needless to say, we cut the Story-That-Must-Not-Be-Named, but you can still hear all about Google and Frommer's, Sony's new "BOGO" initiative for the PS Vita, and the evolution of the Pebble smartwatch &amp;mdash; all in 90 seconds flat.</description>

While that assuredly says something to behavior patterns of these marine mammals, more importantly, it makes for a popular youtube video.

                    <description>Fun fact: in an effort to stay three steps ahead of the curve, we filmed an episode of 90 Seconds on The Verge in 96 frames per second. Symptoms of watching the rough cut included nausea, headaches, temporary loss of vision and / or hearing, obsessive twitching, more nausea, and the urge to look upon reality as an illusion and the display itself a glimpse into a more real parallel dimension. Needless to say, it was powerful stuff.

In the end, we cut the framerate to 24fps and used motion blur to fix some of the choppiness. We won't say which episode it was — if you can't figure it out yourself, it's probably for the best.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Fun fact: in an effort to stay three steps ahead of the curve, we filmed an episode of 90 Seconds on The Verge in 96 frames per second. Symptoms of watching the rough cut included nausea, headaches, temporary loss of vision and / or hearing, obsessive twitching, more nausea, and the urge to look upon reality as an illusion and the display itself a glimpse into a more real parallel dimension. Needless to say, it was powerful stuff.

In the end, we cut the framerate to 24fps and used motion blur to fix some of the choppiness. We won't say which episode it was — if you can't figure it out yourself, it's probably for the best.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Tuesday, August 7, 2012</title>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the future, our thick-rimmed heads-up displays will blast push notifications and fine-tuned sponsored ads at 4K resolution with a pixel density of &lt;i&gt;3,000ppi &lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash; but alas, only a 30Hz refresh rate. Compromises and all. The biggest tech-related epidemic facing our children will be running into trees while trying to watch YouTube videos on their HUDs, but fortunately the act of bumping and falling adds about 100 to your Nike+ Fuel Score. So that's a "win," as our future generations will never say. Yay, future!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Guys, remember that time when we landed on Mars? That was pretty awesome, right? You stayed up until 3 AM watching it, right? Since you did, and subsequently slept through this balmy Monday, we've tracked down all the news (on this world and every other) and boiled it down to just 90 seconds. You slept through a big day, too: the war between Apple and Google took a new turn, Wikipedia went down and took all the world's knowledge with it, and Samsung showed off the new Galaxy Note 10.1 (again), which will finally be available for purchase this month. Oh, and remember how we WENT TO MARS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories of the day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3222691/nasa-curiosity-rover-mars-science-laboratory"&gt;Curiosity: the latest on NASA's newest Mars rover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3223775/apple-youtube-ios6"&gt;Apple: YouTube app will not be included in iOS 6, Google working on standalone version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3223102/wikipedia-goes-down"&gt;Wikipedia's main page down, article pages loading incorrectly (update: restored)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

At least NASA is spreading the love &amp;mdash; and of course by love we mean cash money. Let Adi Robertson break it down for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories of the day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;We like to think of &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt; as the center of all universes, but even the Vox family is much bigger than that. This week, &lt;i&gt;Polygon&lt;/i&gt; is hanging out at the Vox New York studio, which gave us a chance to plead / beg / bribe &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/the-besties-podcast"&gt;Managing Editor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/"&gt;podcast superstar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JustinMcElroy"&gt;glorified booth babe&lt;/a&gt; Justin McElroy to lend his celebrity to our little show. Stay tuned for a very concentrated dose of sunshine and rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories of the day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Friday, July 27, 2012</title>
                    <description>The spectacle! The showmanship! The awe-inspiring display of fireworks! None of these words or phrases have ever been used to describe 90 Seconds on The Verge. But this episode does have Nilay Patel, who at various points in his career been known as spectacular, showy, and combustible. There isn't a better day to have him host, though, given all the Apple v. Samsung evidence that came out last night. It won't rile him up as much as, say, net neutrality, but it puts him in a good state of mind.</description>

&lt;p&gt;But in the event that I ever did tell you we might possibly at some point stop, let me reassure you that was a lie. We're still here, for now until the end of time. And Ellis Hamburger is making absolutely sure of that, one wink and nod at a time. Let him be your guide for today's day of Mountain Lion launch news &amp;mdash; which is just one of the many stories relevant to your interests (as the Stat Trackers That Be are fond of saying). It was, in fact, a day of dates: Mountain Lion today, new &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt; in September, Pebble smartwatch at some point later than that. Go, Ellis, go!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Panic, mostly. It's that feeling when you realize the biggest news of the day won't hit until 45 minutes after you're supposed to film today's &lt;i&gt;90 Seconds&lt;/i&gt;. So what are we to do but invent a time machine. (If time is limited, a simple window into the near future will suffice.) Of course we had to abide by the Time Traveler's Code of Ethics, specifically the clause about breaking embargoes on life-altering events, but at least it let us shoot an episode about Apple's quarterly earnings without asking anyone to stay late. And now that the present has sufficiently caught up with the then-future, well, here we go!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Monday, July 23, 2012</title>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant summer weekend here in New York City, it's blisteringly hot again. The news cycle wasted no time heating up, either, with Canon announcing its long-awaited mirrorless camera at the stroke of midnight. The EOS M stole the show today, but there's plenty more to see here: Reuters gave us a new rumor about the next iPhone, Madfinger gave piracy the finger and made its new game free on Android, and Twitter and NBC collaborated to put a social spin on this summer's Olympics (which start this week). So grab a seat &amp;mdash; preferably in a pool, or less than six inches away from an air conditioner &amp;mdash; and cool off with today's 90 Seconds on The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories of the day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3177289/canon-eos-m-specs-features-release-date-price"&gt;Canon EOS M: specs, features, release date, and price for the long-awaited mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3177117/iphone-5-19-pin-dock-connector"&gt;'iPhone 5' moving to 19-pin dock connector to make room for headphone jack, Reuters reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3177238/dead-trigger-free-android-piracy-rate"&gt;'Dead Trigger' now free on Android due to 'unbelievably high' piracy rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3177011/twitter-nbc-london-olympics-nbc-deal"&gt;Twitter to be 'official narrator' for London Olympics under NBC deal, says WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                    <media:title>90 Seconds on The Verge: Monday, July 23, 2012</media:title>
                    <media:description>&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant summer weekend here in New York City, it's blisteringly hot again. The news cycle wasted no time heating up, either, with Canon announcing its long-awaited mirrorless camera at the stroke of midnight. The EOS M stole the show today, but there's plenty more to see here: Reuters gave us a new rumor about the next iPhone, Madfinger gave piracy the finger and made its new game free on Android, and Twitter and NBC collaborated to put a social spin on this summer's Olympics (which start this week). So grab a seat &amp;mdash; preferably in a pool, or less than six inches away from an air conditioner &amp;mdash; and cool off with today's 90 Seconds on The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;On most Fridays, the tech news cycle tends to slow down a bit. We at the office can take turns relaxing and watching a marathon of the incredible &lt;i&gt;Spider-Man &lt;/i&gt;cartoon from 1967 (highly recommended, by the way). Not today. Google acquired Sparrow, DirecTV and Viacom made nice, and Canon looks poised to be on the cusp of entering the mirrorless camera market. All this and more as told by one of the latest additions &lt;i&gt;The Verge&lt;/i&gt; family, Adrianne Jeffries.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;A storm is brewing in New York City. It's &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/p/NOuYQYgpx4/"&gt;engulfed the heart of Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, and with it, The Verge's east coast offices and Vox studio. This is a catastrophe easily on par with the giant Stay Puff Marshmallow from &lt;i&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/i&gt;. We're afraid we'll never make it out alive. Our dying wish unto you and the world is to watch what may very well be the last 90 Seconds of The Verge. And if it is, hey, at least we're going out on top with Nilay Patel at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It's a little more meta than usual today &amp;mdash; probably because we're a little more sleep-deprived than usual. Which is to say, we haven't slept in days. The Verge office has some &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; good coffee, and for whatever reason Mariah Carey has become the backup musical selection when we run out of Carly Rae Jepsen remixes and covers. It's hard to explain, bear with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "technical error" has landed Microsoft back in hot water with the European Commission (again). Viacom puts &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; back online just in time for Jon Stewart to get angry over Viacom. And as sure as the sun, &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; adds a new dimension to the iPhone display rumors. Pun intended. We're sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;On the heels of another wonderful Bastille Day weekend, this Monday came in like a lion. A lion with a Computer Science degree from Stanford, who's now the CEO of Yahoo. So maybe this analogy doesn't quite hold up, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a newsworthy day. It was definitely bad news for Skype users and great news for Sprint customers, but the jury's still out on the new version of Microsoft Office and whether or not ex-Googler Marissa Meyer can right the ship as the new CEO of Yahoo. So kick back, relax, and let us tell you about all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, we're at episode 14. That's 1,260 seconds in theory and 1,275 seconds in practice (blame it on time dilation in the first two episodes) &amp;mdash; 1,289 if you count the extra one second YouTube adds to every video embed. And 1,289 is a prime number, which is incredible when you think about. It's a conspiracy to the first order, divisible only by itself and The Verge. That's some crazy luck &amp;mdash; and with it being Friday the 13th, the price of luck is unjustly inflated today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your mind blown yet? Are you frothing at the mouth with anger over this inanity? That's okay, we have Ellis Hamburger here to sooth the savage beast in us all. You're welcome, world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS, We're beta testing Ooyala's new video player &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/13/3156720/beta-testing-ooyalas-new-video-player"&gt;help us out&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It's not yet the end of the week but already the news cycle feels... relaxed. Maybe it's the weather, maybe it's a full day without &lt;a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.theverge.com/products/brands/microsoft/52"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; trash-talking a competitor... maybe it's all the full-length episodes Viacom took offline in the wake of its dispute with DirecTV. (As it turns out, 90 Seconds on The Verge is also not on DirecTV &amp;mdash; but if the company's looking for a way to refill those 26 channels, hey, give us a call.) So sit back, relax, and spend 90 of those seconds you wanted to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/223469666817945600"&gt;on the Vergecast today&lt;/a&gt; to hang out with us.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We know what you're thinking. 90 Seconds on The Verge is only 18 minutes old - why change up the format already? Well, it's not your typical host. Coming to you live (in all the ways that aren't live), we've got &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/8/3007525/paul-miller-offline"&gt;Paul "Mr. Offline" Miller&lt;/a&gt; giving you today's top stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's a lot to talk about here. New &lt;i&gt;Tiny Wings. &lt;/i&gt;New hints of Amazon's 4-to-5-inch smartphone. New barbs from Microsoft at Apple. New... indications that the Nexus 7 is shipping very, very soon. There's just so much new &amp;mdash; and better still, there's Paul Miller!&lt;/p&gt;
