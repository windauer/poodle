Over the years, he's worked in various capacities with Madonna, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and George Michael, among many others&amp;mdash;in the process becoming&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/aug/13/features.magazine47" target="_blank"&gt;perhaps the most fabulous bon vivant in the world&lt;/a&gt;. But underneath that drinking, cocaine-using and MDMA-taking persona lurked a man who was desperately seeking the sort of spiritual connection he'd first experienced as a youth. The founder and creative director of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.talenthouse.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Talenthouse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a&amp;nbsp;company which creates content with brand partners such as Rihanna, Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga and more&amp;mdash;Pizzey is passionate about bringing success as well as enlightenment to the masses. In this episode, he and I discuss quitting drugs&amp;nbsp;while continuing to&amp;nbsp;drink, what part the neocortex and limbic brain play in alcohol and drug use&amp;nbsp;and how to get the entire world to embrace the principles behind the 12 steps, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The co-writer of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dumb and Dumber&lt;/em&gt;, Bennett Yellin is far more than a guy who can make the masses giggle until they burst. The writer of a slew of other comedies, Yellin may have gotten on the map when &lt;em&gt;Dumb and Dumber&lt;/em&gt; became a sensation but he was actually bottoming out on crystal meth while his comedic talents were entertaining the masses. It wasn't until he got sober, cleaned up his past and started living life on a pink cloud that he got that career back on track. The long-awaited &lt;em&gt;Dumb and Dumber&lt;/em&gt; sequel is coming out this fall, while Yellin enjoys his 12th year of sobriety and anticipates "marching forth" (his sober anniversary is March 4th) next year. In this episode, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; discuss why it's not a good idea to date your drug dealer, what it's like to be a lazy meth head and being an Orthodox Jewish addict, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Carano has opened up about his battles with booze and anxiety before but in this episode, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; get into the minutia of recovery: how they feel about medication, relapse, swearing, going to Disneyland (as Carano had just gone there with Dr. Drew) and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Writer, comedian, podcaster, TV host and all-around delight Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is one of the greatest lessons out of there for those who like to booze to the point of unmanageability and don't see any problem with it. The author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sippy Cups Are Not For Chardonnay&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;em&gt;Naptime Is The New Happy Hour&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was the role model for partying moms everywhere&amp;mdash;until she realized drinking was more than a fun pastime for her. Now sober, the author of several more books, the star of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Parental Discretion With Stefanie Wilder-Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Nickelodeon and the co-host of the popular For Crying Out Loud podcast, Wilder-Taylor uses her oh so charming powers of persuasion to show moms (and others) that sobriety is just as cool, if not more so, than being the hip, partying mom. Here, she and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;discuss writing books, being outed as an alcoholic by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, how many times we've each been fired and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What I didn't know until he told me (during this interview!) is that, after 23 years sober, he made the choice to start smoking pot. This wasn't some sudden brainstorm of course but a decision he came to after a scooter accident left&amp;nbsp;him hooked on painkillers and he used medical marijuana to detox. Though this isn't a common path for anyone who had multiple decades of sobriety (or recommended!), Ebner explains in this interview how he's able to smoke pot non addictively&amp;mdash;and I have no reason to doubt him. Not only do he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; unpack that fascinating turn of events here but they also get into Narconon (the Scientology "addiction recovery" program), the ways his sober friends have reacted to his pot smoking, how they only see each other as dueling talking heads on shows like E's&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhGfhy7ELE8" target="_blank"&gt;Secret Societies of Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"&gt;(she's in this even though she's&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"&gt;not in this teaser) and the hell of writing books for a living.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedian Craig Gass is known for his ridiculously spot-on celebrity impressions (seriously, his Gene Simmons is so accurate that Gass actually accused Gene Simmons of being the fake on Howard Stern). In addition to numerous Stern appearances, Gass has been on &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City, King of Queens&lt;/em&gt; and numerous celebrity roasts. Growing up in all deaf family, Gass honed his skills because he learned to speak from watching TV. Later he became a big time party guy with a penchant for cocaine. Here, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; talk about those nights Gass turned down ladies at clubs so he could party in back rooms, how good it feels to be sober and paid for your craft and what people who are struggling with addiction can do, among many other topics. Plus: celebrity impressions galore!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The comedian ANT may have legally changed his name from Anthony but that is hardly the most unique fact about him. The veteran of &lt;em&gt;Last Comic Standing&lt;/em&gt; (six of the show's seven seasons) is also a TV show host who puts those milquetoast hosts to shame by delivering genuine, laugh-out-loud moments&amp;mdash;during his years hosting &lt;em&gt;Celebrity Fit Club&lt;/em&gt;, on all of his many TV appearances (on shows as varied as &lt;em&gt;Tyra Banks&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Best Week Ever&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt;) and on Howard Stern (where he's a frequent guest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his outspoken extroversion kept many from realizing that he had a horrific drug addiction which led to homelessness as well as to members of the Hell's Angels urging him to cut down on his meth use (you'll have to listen to the episode to get that whole story). Here, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; discuss the time he thought he was being intervened on so he fessed up about his addiction, the methods he uses for staying in the moment in sobriety and how his Greek Orthodox upbringing influences his spirituality today, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And she's been sober for over six years while also becoming a certified &lt;a href="http://imlaurahouse.wix.com/laurahousemeditation" target="_blank"&gt;meditation teacher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://laurahouse.com/100-days-of-high-raw/" target="_blank"&gt;raw food expert&lt;/a&gt;. Yep, her repertoire is vast: this is a girl who knows how to bring the funny to meditation. Other Laura House accomplishments include wowing the crowds at storytelling shows (including Anna David's &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/talesoflustandloves-podcast/id510248371" target="_blank"&gt;True Tales of Lust and Love&lt;/a&gt;, which she performed in more than any other writer or comedian), publishing essays in several anthologies (including the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;True Tales of Lust and Love&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/True-Tales-Lust-Love-David/dp/159376538X" target="_blank"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;) and being featured on Comedy Central. Here, she and David discuss sending a video of a drunken, slurry set to a big manager, various ways the alcoholic brain doesn't seem to work right and how to work through disappointment in sobriety, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedian Amber Tozer is so much more than a comedian. Sure, she's performed stand-up all over the world, been featured on &lt;em&gt;Last Comic Standing&lt;/em&gt; and stars in the hit web series nitTWITS but she's also written on the Emmy-award winning show &lt;em&gt;Mad&lt;/em&gt; and taken time off from comedy to work with autistic children. Want more? She had an advice columns on Laughspin, has written for HuffPo, has appeared on The Mental Illness Happy Hour and much more. Here, she and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;about how her moment of clarity involved driving on the Bay Bridge drunk and waking up the next morning fully accepting that she was an alcoholic and needed to do something about it. We also delve into what it was like to grow up with alcoholism (her father and grandgather on her mom's side), drinking before &lt;em&gt;Last Comic Standing&lt;/em&gt; and what she's learned in her roughly six years of sobriety, among other topics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Nightlife impressario Brent Bolthouse has ruled the LA social landscape for the past few decades, helping to put such classic clubs as the Roxbury, the Opium Den, the Viper Room and Joseph's on the map (the way it works is this: wherever Bolthouse backs, the coolest kids in town follow and lines out the door ensue). In 1999, he opened The Coffee House on Sunset Blvd., immediately attracting a celeb clientele (it was reportedly the first place Robert Downey, Jr. went post jail) but more importantly, creating a 24-hour-a-day gathering place for sober people when he started having open AA meetings in the back room. While The Coffee House closed in 2003, Bolthouse has gone on not only to open a slew of other successful clubs but also to play himself on &lt;em&gt;The Hills, Entourage &lt;/em&gt;and a number of other hit shows. And he's been clean since the age of 16, racking up an impressive 27 years of sobriety. His spirituality matters much more to him than all the celebs in his proximity (even the fact that Jay Z &lt;a href="http://rapgenius.com/Jay-z-i-just-wanna-love-u-give-it-2-me-lyrics#note-305763" target="_blank"&gt;immortalized Bolthouse's strict door policy in his hit song "I Just Wanna Love You,"&lt;/a&gt; when Bolthouse's partner Jenifer Rosario wouldn't let Jigga and his group past the velvet rope until he dropped some of the entourage). In this episode, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; discuss his first jobs (gas station attendant, hairdresser), last days using (meth was his drug of choice), being an "anti-social social person" and how he maintains a spiritual connection in the hubbub of Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He created and then sold the website TVgasm years ago (he still blogs, mostly about TV and food, on his own well-trafficked blog, BSideBlog). But here's the really interesting part about him&amp;mdash;and the part that earned him an episode of his own: for 30 years, he was 100% in the closet. As in: we were friends and I had no idea he was gay until he came out to me a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"&gt;In this episode, he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; talk about what it was like to live with a secret like that for your entire life&amp;mdash;the compartmentalization needed, the shame (and online porn) required to maintain the ruse you're somewhat convinced people suspect isn't true anyway. They get into all that as well as how the recovery movement in a way mimics the gay movement in terms of societal awareness and the attempts many people make toward removing the shame about something you can't control and isn't your fault. They also reminisce a bit about the days&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Remix" target="_blank"&gt;when they got paid decent money to sit on a TV set and discuss&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;for 20 minutes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mentioned also in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/tag/jimmy-pardo/" target="_blank"&gt;Jimmy Pardo episode&lt;/a&gt;!) And listen to his two podcasts, Watch What Crappens and The Banter Blender (Anna David has been&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://podcastone.com/pg/jsp/program/episode.jsp?programID=448&amp;amp;pid=240990" target="_blank"&gt;a guest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/banter-with-ben-and-lisa/88-twitter-etiquette-and-tv-theme-songs-guest-anna-david" target="_blank"&gt;on both&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

People came to find out about her after she and Alie Ward made a video of themselves concocting &amp;nbsp;ajoke cocktail called a McNuggetini and the video went viral; next they were being profiled in The New York Times and starring in the Food Newtwork's Drinks with Alie and Georgia. The Cooking Channel's CLassy Ladies with Alie &amp;amp; Georgia and their highly addicitve podcast Slumber Party with Alie and Georgia followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She's also struggled with eating disorders, esteem issues and all the other issues that come along, all too often, with just being a woman&amp;mdash;er, person&amp;mdash;in society today. Here, she and AfterParty's Anna David talk about wild youths, finding stability and what happens when best friends fight, among other topics. [Note: in this episode, they discuss the fact that Hardwick was doing hard drugs and able to stop without getting sober; this isn't to say that AfterParty recommends this path for people who are using hard drugs; addiction is self-diagnosed and many who use harder drugs aren't doing so recreationally.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Comedian &lt;a href="http://www.jessejoyce.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Joyce&lt;/a&gt; is a New York-based comedian who's appeared on &lt;em&gt;Comedy Underground with Dave Attell, @Midnight, Last Comic Standing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Eye&lt;/em&gt; (among many others), has written on numerous Comedy Central roasts and award shows and performed in over 15 countries. He's also sober after booze almost destroyed his health (and got him a DUI). The guy's big on giving back to the sober community, too, performing regularly in &lt;a href="http://www.alcoholawarenessprograms.com/Alcohol-Awareness/Jesse-Joyce.html" target="_blank"&gt;Alcohol Awareness programs&lt;/a&gt;. While he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterParty&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://annadavid.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anna David&lt;/a&gt; veer off into the nitty gritty of comedy (and whether living in LA or NY is better&amp;mdash;Joyce is Manhattan all the way), they also trace Joyce's first drink at 20 to his last one at 26, his family's history of alcoholism and how he manages to be a happy alcoholic, among other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The short version of the story is this: sidelined by an injury while playing professional football, Howes had no money, nowhere to live and no interest in doing anything but the sport that he could no longer do. So he took to his computer and managed to become a social media maven in just a few years, earning millions in the process and then coaching and inspiring many others to do the same. As it turns out, he was also dealing with having been sexually abused as a child&amp;mdash;an event he never shared with anyone until recently. Now he's doing what he does: telling others about it so that they can be released from their own shame and then become, as he would say, great. Here we talk about dreams, passion, finding inspiration and handling adversity, among many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But when he washed up on the &lt;em&gt;Celebrity Rehab&lt;/em&gt; shores, it became clear that he wasn't a bad guy, just a sick one suffering from addiction. Not only is he now sober but he also works full-time in recovery at &lt;a href="http://www.livingsober.com/blog/jason-wahler/" target="_blank"&gt;Northbound&lt;/a&gt;, a treatment center in Costa Mesa, California.

The host of MTV's &lt;em&gt;Headbangers Ball&lt;/em&gt; and former owner of the Cathouse club, Rachtman now hosts Racing Rocks on over 120 radio stations and also lives a life free of drugs and alcohol after a multi-year battle with the substances. (No, he wants to assure you, he's actually been absolutely sober for a lot of the "stupid shit" he's done over the past 20 years.) Here, we talk about what got him sober (a drug that starts with m, ends with h and has et in between), how he lives today and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mackenzie Phillips had, from the outside, the most glamorous childhood that could be imagined: the daughter of the Mamas and Papas lead singer John Phillips, she starred in &lt;em&gt;American Graffiti&lt;/em&gt; and on the hit TV show &lt;em&gt;One Day at a Time&lt;/em&gt; as a teenager, while also hitting every club on the Sunset Strip. But her career was stymied by addiction&amp;mdash;until 1992, when she went into treatment. After a bout of long-term sobriety, she relapsed and was eventually arrested with heroin in her while on her way to New York for a &lt;em&gt;One Day at a Time&lt;/em&gt; reunion on &lt;em&gt;The Rachel Ray Show&lt;/em&gt;. The release of her book, &lt;em&gt;High on Arrival&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;and the revelation in it that she'd had a 10-year consensual sexual relationship with her father&amp;mdash;sent the media (and her family) into a tizzy. Now sober again and arguably as enthusiastic about recovery as anyone in the world, Phillips is the Recovery Advocate for the Pasadena Recovery Center and a sought-after speaker on spiritual matters. You'll see why when you listen to this episode.&lt;/p&gt;

He and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterPartyChat&lt;/a&gt;'s Anna David met over a decade ago, before she was sober&amp;mdash;when he called the fact that she was doing cocaine "so very 80's." Here they discuss Michael's childhood in an English boarding school, his time doing drugs (with several shout outs to Quaaludes) and the fact that he's been sober since 1981. Also in there: singing! Reminiscing about the date they once had! And more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Actor and director Josh Leonard (though he'd introduce himself to you as Joshua) launched into the spotlight as one of the stars of &lt;em&gt;The Blair Witch Project&lt;/em&gt;. After a bit of a wayward youth (getting in trouble for having alcohol and &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;s at school, time spent in a boys home and legal emancipation) followed by a bit of a wayward next-phase-in-life (culminating in heroin addiction), Leonard was only a few months into sobriety when the indie movie he'd made in two weeks became the Next Big Thing. In the years since, he's done time on many a TV series (including &lt;em&gt;Hung&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The United States of Tara&lt;/em&gt;) before 2009's &lt;em&gt;Humpday&lt;/em&gt; put him back in the indie spotlight. Also a successful director, Leonard has done both music videos (Morcheeba, Fitz and the Tantrums) as well as feature films (2011's &lt;em&gt;The Lie&lt;/em&gt;). He's also maintained not only his sobriety but also his humility, which wasn't so easy in the beginning (stick around for the white limo story, which comes hear the end). Here he and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterPartyChat&lt;/a&gt;'s Anna David talk about how as kid, he used to try to work through recess to avoid getting his ass kicked, &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/a-letter-to-my-brother/" target="_blank"&gt;the letter he wrote that helped his brother get sober&lt;/a&gt; and whether crying out of gratitude is "girly" or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Author Carrie White has lived many lives. The first female hairdresser to the stars, White tended to the tresses of everyone from Ann Margaret and Elvis to Sharon Tate and Elizabeth Taylor. And she did it all on rollerskates (it was the 70s, people). But her high-flying life&amp;mdash;which included three husbands and five children&amp;mdash;was masking a crippling drug addiction which eventually left her curled up in the fetal position outside her dealer's door. Now sober for multiple decades, White built her hairdressing business back up and published a best-selling memoir, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Upper-Cut-Highlights-Hollywood-Life/dp/1439199094" target="_blank"&gt;Upper Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, about the entire thing. Here she talks to &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterPartyChat&lt;/a&gt;'s Anna David about bottoming out, coming back, and how getting sober but continuing to smoke is like switching seats on the Titanic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But many first came to know her when she was the house manager on &lt;em&gt;Sober House&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;a job she got after she went from being one of Dr. Drew's nightmare clients to one of his miracles. Here she and &lt;a href="http://afterpartychat.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AfterPartyChat&lt;/a&gt;'s Anna David talk about the drug dealer they used to share, how they first got sober together back in the early 2000s and whether or not Gimenez would use her real name if she was a drug dealer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
