No matter if truck loader, merch guy or sound engineer - they all work in the mysterious rock'n'roll business and have a story to tell. And you have time to listen while sitting in a bloody tour bus! </itunes:summary>

                    <description>I was in Deventer and talked to Allex, who was the monitor engineer at the Burgrweeshuis. He’s a volunteer and did a great job so I asked him to tell me his story. 
He’s studying electrical engineering and works as a sound engineer. With the combined knowledge of those different fields he also built some hand wired audio effects. Have a listen!</description>

                    <description>This is the first episode of 52roads. Please ignore my crapy english. I was really excited and nervous like hell! I promise to get better. The german episodes will be easier, I guess.

I met Marc during a tour weekend at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park. He was mixing Against Me! twice just before I was the next guy on the desk.
I talked to him about his job, how he became a sound engineer and tour manager and asked him about a special mic I found at the drums set of Against Me!'s drummer.</description>
