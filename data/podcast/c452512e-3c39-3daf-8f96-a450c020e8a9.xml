                    <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"&gt;Buckle up: Dimity and Sarah cover a lot of ground in this podcast, starting with a half-marathon race recap by SBS, and some thoughts from Dimity about her rapidly approaching Pikes Peak Ascent. The ladies are joined by &lt;a href="http://theturtlepath.blogspot.com/"&gt;Pam Smith&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a pathologist, mother of two, and kickass ultramarathoner. Pam has them hanging on every word as she tells how she went from being the fourth-to-last finisher in the 2012 &lt;a href="http://www.wser.org"&gt;Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to winning the prestigious ultra the very next year. (!!!) Yet it&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to hear Pam admit, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf7wZvraWV0"&gt;&amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s gotta be some peer pressure to do burpees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pam also tells the tale of how she and her&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"&gt;9-year-old daughter completed a 24-hour race around a 1-mile loop; with plenty of rest breaks and, &amp;ldquo;about 80% walking,&amp;rdquo; the youngster covered 34 miles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From there, it&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride in which the topics flit from the first-ever &lt;a href="http://anothermotherrunner.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=202852738b0b10dea0d335776&amp;amp;id=41d243455f"&gt;AMR running retreat &lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(next April in Little Rock, Arkansas) to our third book coming out next spring, plus the announcement of the AMR Running/Reading Club (AMRRR, pronounced, &amp;ldquo;AM-errrrrrr&amp;rdquo;). First book on the docket: Rachel Toor&amp;rsquo;s young adult novel&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://astore.amazon.com/booksbypodcastguests-20"&gt;On the Road to Find Out&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"&gt;&amp;nbsp;about a high school girl who takes up running and navigates the gauntlet of college admissions. Read it by September 8 to be able to submit questions that we&amp;rsquo;ll ask Rachel (another ultrarunner) on air. (Hope that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound too much like a homework assignment!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She&amp;rsquo;s also a mother runner who knocked 45 minutes off her marathon PR by making a few simple changes to her diet and training so this woman practices what she preaches. According to Cassie, our gut needs to be trained just like muscles and heart do, so she talks about how to be well fueled for a run and how to deal with GI issues during and after a race. Once this podcast hits, we predict a spike in sales of apple sauce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"&gt;Oh, and find out about Sarah&amp;rsquo;s new baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Greg talks about how much time is realistic to shave off a finish time from one half to the next (imparting good news for newbie runners!), as well as clueing listeners in to realistic 5K and 10K results as predictors for for half-marathon success. In his reassuring Southern twang, Greg emphasizes the importance of staying mentally, as well as physically, strong and alert during the entire 13.1-mile course. This podcast provides the details&amp;mdash;and motivation&amp;mdash;to aim for a 1:XX half-marathon finish!&lt;/p&gt;

The good doctor also talks about running during pregnancy. The show&amp;rsquo;s highlight, though, is Dimity over-sharing about her shaving habits. Talk about TMI!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
