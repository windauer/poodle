                    <title>The Verge Mobile Show 061 - September 3rd, 2013</title>
                    <description>It's a new month, the summer's over, and it's time to get back to the grind. Apparently, nearly every company in the mobile space is well aware of this and has decided to drop loads of news within the past week for us to digest. We've got a name for the next version of Android, Verizon bought itself out from its mommy, and Apple has finally confirmed that it will be announcing something next week. Not to mention that the IFA trade show officially starts in Berlin, Germany this week. Oh, and did we forget that Microsoft just bought Nokia's phone division for over $7 billion? Yeah, that happened too. Be sure to catch this week's show — it's shaping up to be a good one.</description>

                    <description>We're smack dab in the middle of a crazy week in mobile: Verizon's new Droids were just announced, Google has some Android news up its sleeve for Wednesday, Apple is set announce earnings today, and our co-host Dan Seifert is literally mobile. In the midst of this madness, we're committing to another Verge Mobile Show, though we're going to start a little later than usual, at 6PM ET / 11PM BST. Join three quarters of our team for a show replete with vegetable jokes and carrier rants, where we will look back, look forward, but most of all: look deep into your eyes through the magic of the web.</description>

In the midst of this madness, we're committing to another Verge Mobile Show, though we're going to start a little later than usual, at 6PM ET / 11PM BST. Join three quarters of our team for a show replete with vegetable jokes and carrier rants, where we will look back, look forward, but most of all: look deep into your eyes through the magic of the web.</itunes:summary>

                    <title>The Verge Mobile Show 056 - July 30th, 2013</title>
                    <description>The summer of never-ending mobile news is rolling along, and we've got yet another installment of The Verge Mobile Show coming your way today to discuss it all. We've got a new version of Android, the most interesting camera phone ever, and a smaller version of one of our favorite smartphones of the year to cover this week, so it is lining up to be a good show. Chris has decided to take a vacation this week (we're still trying to figure who gave him permission to do so), but Vlad, Dieter, and Dan (who is freshly back from a vacation of his own) will be holding down the fort this week. Tune in at 4:30PM ET / 21:30 BST to catch the action live.</description>

                    <description>Summer is nearly upon us. The kids are getting out of school, the ice cream man is making his rounds, and the air conditioners are being cranked at full blast. But just because vacation season is underway for most people, it doesn't mean that anyone is taking a break in our little mobile universe. We're a week out from Apple's big announcement of iOS 7, and the debate surrounding it is still going strong. Nokia recently teased us with an upcoming device announcement — could it be the long-awaited Windows Phone 'EOS' device with a real PureView camera? And Huawei just took the wraps off of its latest flagship handset. We'll be tackling all this and more in this week's episode of The Verge Mobile Show, so tune in around 4:30PM ET / 21:30 BST to catch it! </description>

                    <description>A full week has passed since the last time The Verge Mobile Show was recorded, which means it's high time we had another episode. A few things have happened in that time span: some email apps have launched, new phones have been teased, and CEOs have more or less been doing their thing. </description>

                    <description>Following last week's Verge Mobile Show hiatus, we came to understand that skipping a week can lead to some table-flipping. So this week, all that all the rage, vitriol, ennui, and resentment that had been pent-up in a distended mass in the bodies of every smartphone user needs to be vented like a spleen under the knife of a medieval surgeon. Vlad, Dan, and Dieter just happen to have some blades and maybe a few leeches lying around, so we'll do our level-best to ensure that the dark humours are bled out. We'll also cover a full two weeks of mobile news, including a big shake up from T-Mobile and (perhaps) equally big rumors of a shake up from Facebook.</description>

Vlad, Dan, and Dieter just happen to have some blades and maybe a few leeches lying around, so we'll do our level-best to ensure that the dark humours are bled out. We'll also cover a full two weeks of mobile news, including a big shake up from T-Mobile and (perhaps) equally big rumors of a shake up from Facebook.</media:description>

                    <description>It's Tuesday, March 19th, 2013, and that means it's time for another installment of The Verge Mobile Show. This is episode number 40, meaning that we are now officially old and over the hill. We may be older now, but fear not, we're not any wiser than we were when we started this thing. This week, between Samsung finally unveiling the Galaxy S4 to Andy Rubin passing the Android torch on, we've got plenty to discuss, so be sure to join us!</description>

                    <title>The Verge Mobile Show 039 - March 12th, 2013</title>
                    <description>With a one-week break under our collective belts, we're back with plenty to discuss for this edition of The Verge Mobile Show. We've reviewed both the HTC One and the Sony Xperia Z and as copious as those reviews were, there is much more to say. That's why special guest David Pierce will be joining us to drop knowledge bombs about HTC's latest offering. We're also mere days (or hours, or maybe even minutes, depending on how high you can count) away from Samusung's next big phone announcement — but leaks of the Galaxy S4 are already out and ready to be scrutinized. You might say that this week will be chock-full o' news, but then you'd be the kind of person who says "chock-full" and maybe you don't want to be that person.</description>

                    <description>Is there a better way to celebrate the release of a new, flagship smartphone than with the Verge Mobile Show? No, no there is not, and we'd really appreciate it if you'd stop with the vuvuzelas. Join us as we discuss the HTC One and whether it's enough to get the company out of its doldrums. That's not the only mobile news on tap, with Samsung waiting in the wings and MWC less than a week away. That means you should put on your party hats and break out the balloons, we're going to bust this industry open like a piñata. There will be cake. (The preceding sentence is a lie.)</description>

                    <description>It's the thick of winter, that grey time between CES and Mobile World Congress where mobile nerds scavenge for news to survive on. Temperatures reach Hoth-level depths, and blizzards threaten to wipe out all forms of wireless communication. But there are ways to survive, and weekend drives in six-figure electric vehicles complete with smartphone monitoring apps and 3G data connections do wonders to stimulate the soul. Therefore, we bring you this week's edition of The Verge Mobile Show, an oasis of mobile related chatter (and plenty of non-sequitur) in a time when things are bleak.</description>

                    <description>Another week of big smartphone news — especially in the Blackberry space — means that we have another Verge Mobile Show to bring you. Plus, in honor of RIM renaming itself BlackBerry (because that's what everybody calls it anyway), we're renaming The Verge Mobile Show. Tune in for "Three or four guys talk about smartphones, 'The Fast and the Furious,' and the nutritional value of various vegetables" (because that's what everybody calls it anyway). There's also a small chance we'll append various other descriptors to the title, including but not limited to "orange phones, carrier spectrum, and weather apps." You'll want to join us this week, because there's been major movement in pretty much every single topic mentioned above. Tune in!</description>

                    <title>The Verge Mobile Show 033 - January 22nd, 2013</title>
                    <description>It's been a slow week for mobile news. Perhaps it's the calm before the storm of Mobile World Congress. You can feel a sense of anticipation — a sense that a lot of news will soon be announced. Companies are keeping things tight, for the most part, but there is so much going on that they are bursting at the seams. And with this type of pressure, it's impossible to avoid leaks.

Just like in your plumbing, leaks can be messy, and while we don't necessarily have to break out the mop, we do feel compelled to speculate about certain photos, and what these photos allegedly say or don't say about an upcoming product. While speculation may or may not be a productive exercise, it does allow us a chance to dream. Will one of these companies finally get it right? Only time will tell.

                    <description>Our favorite mobile hosts have returned from Las Vegas heathy and intact. Well, not really healthy — everyone's a little sick and extremely exhausted. And not really intact, either — Dan somehow lost his beard, and we're not really sure where Chris is. Anyways, we've got quite a show in store for you. You can expect reactions to BlackBerry Z10 leaks and a feisty CEO's antics, as well a look ahead to Mobile World Congress.</description>

                    <description>You didn't think we'd leave you without a Verge Mobile Show for a whole week, did you? The four beards of mobile are coming together for a one-off special from the grounds of CES in Vegas. We've seen things, touched things, played with, hated, loved, and been indifferent about other things. Some of them have allegedly been seen conducting phone calls too. Just tune in at the allotted hour and enjoy the mayhem.</description>

                    <description>The Verge Mobile Show turns 30 this week, but it doesn't look a day over 29. Ok, it's been a little bit pixelated recently, but we'll blame that on Google. Speaking of Google: Dieter, Chris, and Dan review Google Maps for iOS and the end of Exchange ActiveSync for Google services. How will these latest developments affect your mobile life? And is Microsoft getting nothing but coal from Google in it's stocking this year?

Also on the agenda: The latest Android hardware including the HTC M7, the Sony Yuga, and the Galaxy Grand.</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Drink up. This one's on us. Don't worry, we have to work tomorrow too. Relax. Let your guard down. Forget your inhibitions. It's time to say what you really want to say... about mobile. Are you really happy with your current phone? Or are you thinking about playing the field?

On this week's Verge Mobile Show Dieter, Dan, and an uncharacteristically high definition Chris share the reasons why if you're buying a new phone that's not the iPhone, you should really wait a couple weeks.</itunes:summary>

                    <description>The Verge Mobile Show turns 18 today, and with the recent release of the iPhone 5 and major announcements from HTC and RIM there's plenty of reasons to rock out. Speaking of rocking out, RIM released an "interesting" new music video. Is it so bad it's good? or just so bad it's actually just really bad? Dieter calls in from the Blackberry Jam conference in San Diego with his latest first-hand report.</description>

                    <description>After an amazing yet bizarro face-to-face experience, our mobile masters are once again banished to the far corners of the earth. As it turns out, a single city can only handle such a high concentration of mobile passion for so long. The World needs balance, so we oblige. On This week's Mobile Show, rookie Dan Seifert takes over the big rectangle while Dieter is off having some quality time with Zuck. Dan, Chris and Vlad review the potential of Nokia and Windows phone 8, the state of LTE in Europe and the U.S., and rumors and predictions for the iPhone 5 launch.</description>

And the rumor mill? As rampant as ever, of course. On this week's episode of The Verge Mobile Show, mobile's biggest nerds put their heads together to make sense of it all. What's Vlad's take on Everything Everywhere and the advent of LTE in Europe? What single feature convinced Chris to carry the Galaxy Nexus? Why is Dieter a secret BlackBerry 10 fanboy?
