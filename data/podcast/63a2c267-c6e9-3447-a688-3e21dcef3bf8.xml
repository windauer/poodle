Wouldn’t it be great if our ‘good intentions’ worked the way that we think they should?  Not even enthusiasm guarantees positive results. There’s often a wide gap between our intentions and our actions.  We fail to take the action necessary to be in alignment with our good intentions. This can be very frustrating.  

Good intentions don’t magically lead to good results. They are a start; however, they are unfortunately not enough. This is just the truth!  We all can use a little accountability in our life to help us stay focused so we can achieve all our goals in the timeframes we desire.

            <title>You are Only as Successful As Your Beliefs</title>
            <description>Are your beliefs supporting your success?  The most definitive way to know whether your beliefs are leading to success or disaster is to examine what you say to yourself.  Do you typically think to yourself that you will be successful or that there’s no use in trying, because it will never work.  The nature of your belief system – positive or negative – will be the single greatest determining factor in your success, so you had better start thinking success.  

When the negative talk starts swirling in your head, just cancel it out – sweep it out – delete it.  Focus on the positive (and what you really want) and remember that your success is completely dependent upon you and you alone.  Although you can allow talk from those around you to negatively affect your progress, no one can prevent you from achieving your goals.  The determining factor is always and only your ability to hold true to your belief in yourself.  

There is always a way, so take a “no-excuses” approach to achieving your goals and you will achieve them.  The way isn’t necessarily apparent, and if you feel like you’ve hit a roadblock - get creative.  You’d be surprised how you can come up with some creative and effective solutions when you think outside the box.  The idea is to maintain an element of creativity when coming up with solutions, so you are constantly expanding your belief system.

            <title>Is Lack of Motivation Stopping You From Getting Things Done?</title>
            <description>If you’re sitting at your desk with a “To Do List” a mile long, but you can’t find the motivation to tackle it, keep listening.  

How is it that some days it feels as if you have enough motivation to conquer the world, yet other days, the smallest task seems to drain the life out of you?  The answer is simple: motivation is fueled by your level of desire and commitment, and when your desire and commitment falls, so does your motivation.

Have you ever been so engrossed by something you loved every second of it and lost track of all time?  Your desire and commitment was so high, that time became non-existent, when in reality, several hours had passed.

So how do you deal with lack of motivation for tasks that you dislike, yet must be done?

The good news is that your lack of motivation can be resolved with only a shift in thinking.  

Stay focused on the results!  How does your choice to procrastinate help or hurt your ability to achieve your goals?  Asking this question will help bring clarity and reconnect you with your desire for achieving your goals, motivating you out of your slump.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">If you’re sitting at your desk with a “To Do List” a mile long, but you can’t find the motivation to tackle it, keep listening.  

How is it that some days it feels as if you have enough motivation to conquer the world, yet other days, the smallest task seems to drain the life out of you?  The answer is simple: motivation is fueled by your level of desire and commitment, and when your desire and commitment falls, so does your motivation.

Have you ever been so engrossed by something you loved every second of it and lost track of all time?  Your desire and commitment was so high, that time became non-existent, when in reality, several hours had passed.

So how do you deal with lack of motivation for tasks that you dislike, yet must be done?

The good news is that your lack of motivation can be resolved with only a shift in thinking.  

Stay focused on the results!  How does your choice to procrastinate help or hurt your ability to achieve your goals?  Asking this question will help bring clarity and reconnect you with your desire for achieving your goals, motivating you out of your slump.

Aim for what you want each and every day!

            <title>4 Tips for Choosing the Right Virtual Assistant</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Tips for Choosing the Right Virtual Assistant.

Choosing the right virtual assistant isn’t always an easy task.  It’s easy to get caught in the confusion of choosing the right provider when the sheer volume of available VA’s can be overwhelming.  These 4 Tips for Choosing the Right Virtual Assistant will guide you in the right direction when making your final decision.  Remember, you shouldn’t base your decision solely on price, education or even an impressive client roster.  Base your final decision on the individual you believe is best qualified to complete the job to your specifications without breaking the bank.  

Important aspects of choosing the right virtual assistant:
1.	Familiarize yourself with hiring venues
2.	Be clear out the details
3.	Set a realistic budget
4.	Check references and testimonials 

If you get value from these Podcasts, please take a minute to leave me a short review.

            <title>Effective Goal Setting Guidelines</title>
            <description>When you think of goal setting, we can start with a school of thought that says every goal a person sets should be a S.M.A.R.T. goal.  SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Tangible or Timely.  Your goals must have a specific target date for achievement, including a month, day, and year.  It is surprising to me how many people don’t set a target date for goals.  Some might say a year but most don’t set a month, day and a year for their desired goal achievement. 

•	I take issue with the words realistic and attainable. I believe goals should be “stretch goals,” goals that are achievable, and also require that the person stretch their limits. This extra push provides inspiration and motivation. Even if you fall short of achieving a stretch goal, you’ve still most likely exceeded your “realistic” goal.

•	The word attainable bothers me for similar reasons. Obviously, you want your goal to be within reach, but that same “stretch” should be added for additional motivation and inspiration.

•	The emotional element to goal achievement is very important. Think about how you would think and feel once you have achieved the goal. This adds the emotional element that helps inspire you even more.

In theory, working toward your goals is not complicated. 

Most days, most of the things you do, should move you toward your goals.

            <title>4 Ways to Increase the Productivity of your Business</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Ways to Increase the Productivity of your Business.
 
Every business owner is on the lookout for effective ways to increase productivity for their team.  The reality is that business owners and employees are ineffective and unproductive probably more often than they think.  The key is to reduce lost hours and wasted manpower.  Here are some ways you can take an active approach to increasing the efficiency and productivity of your business.
 
Productivity Tip #1: Lead by example.  If you are a business owner, you must absolutely be held to the highest standard.  If you work directly with an assistant or team of employees, you should always lead by example. 
 
If you2019re a habitual procrastinator or have trouble focusing on productivity, you would serve yourself and your business well by hiring an accountability coach.  An accountability coach will show you several effective ways to increase productivity in your business - and hold you accountable for your actions, as well as your results.  When you are asked to explain to your accountability coach why you didn2019t achieve the task at hand because you chose to watch T.V, it won2019t feel comfortable to be put on the hot seat by your coach.
 
Productivity Tip #2: Work each day with a To-Do List.  Creating a to-do list is one of the most efficient ways to increase the productivity of your business.  Crafting a detailed to-do list for you and your team will help them comprehend exactly what is expected of them each day.  This will motivate them to complete the tasks they2019ve been given with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness.  If your assistant or team is known for procrastinating, this is an especially effective tool for encouraging them to stay focused.  When you don2019t leave wiggle room for lollygagging, you2019ll have one heck of a productive team. Customize each To-Do List to each team member, so that each team member can be held directly accountable for their actions. 
 
Productivity Tip #3: Delegate appropriately.  If you cannot delegate, you cannot increase productivity.  Period.  The key to increasing productivity is realizing where your time is best spent.  Where your assistant2019s or team2019s time is spent matters as well.  When you can delegate the right tasks to the right person, your business will operate without a hitch.  However, hang on to tasks you should have let go of long ago, and you stagnate your success.  When you need a task complete, look to the personality and experience of your team in order to decide which employee would be best suited for the task.
 
Productivity Tip #4: Build a bigger team!  It2019s a simple concept, really.  The more team members you have producing, the more work you2019ll generate, and hopefully, the more money you2019ll bring in for your business.  Hiring additional team members is one of the most effective ways to increase productivity for your business.  For lower priority or common tasks you should be able to find someone at a reasonable rate.  However, for senior or high-priority positions, you2019ll obviously need to hire experienced professionals. 
 
As a basic productivity rule, you should NEVER be answering your phone, doing bookkeeping or sending invoices.  You should be spending your time devoted to driving income, while your team members tend to the basic tasks.
 
As you can see, there are several ways to increase the productivity of your business.  These tips are simple, yet effective ways of instilling the principles of productivity in your team.
 
Action Step:
What will your next steps be so you can increase productivity and achieve your goals?  Create your game plan to help put you in the highest probability position for goal achievement. Take these four tips and turn them into four separate weekly goals to be achieved within the next month.  Write down specific actions you can take to achieve each weekly goal and put them in your calendar so they cannot be ignored.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Today we are going to talk about 4 Ways to Increase the Productivity of your Business.
 
Every business owner is on the lookout for effective ways to increase productivity for their team.  The reality is that business owners and employees are ineffective and unproductive probably more often than they think.  The key is to reduce lost hours and wasted manpower.  Here are some ways you can take an active approach to increasing the efficiency and productivity of your business.
 
Productivity Tip #1: Lead by example.  If you are a business owner, you must absolutely be held to the highest standard.  If you work directly with an assistant or team of employees, you should always lead by example. 
 
If you2019re a habitual procrastinator or have trouble focusing on productivity, you would serve yourself and your business well by hiring an accountability coach.  An accountability coach will show you several effective ways to increase productivity in your business - and hold you accountable for your actions, as well as your results.  When you are asked to explain to your accountability coach why you didn2019t achieve the task at hand because you chose to watch T.V, it won2019t feel comfortable to be put on the hot seat by your coach.
 
Productivity Tip #2: Work each day with a To-Do List.  Creating a to-do list is one of the most efficient ways to increase the productivity of your business.  Crafting a detailed to-do list for you and your team will help them comprehend exactly what is expected of them each day.  This will motivate them to complete the tasks they2019ve been given with the greatest efficiency and effectiveness.  If your assistant or team is known for procrastinating, this is an especially effective tool for encouraging them to stay focused.  When you don2019t leave wiggle room for lollygagging, you2019ll have one heck of a productive team. Customize each To-Do List to each team member, so that each team member can be held directly accountable for their actions. 
 
Productivity Tip #3: Delegate appropriately.  If you cannot delegate, you cannot increase productivity.  Period.  The key to increasing productivity is realizing where your time is best spent.  Where your assistant2019s or team2019s time is spent matters as well.  When you can delegate the right tasks to the right person, your business will operate without a hitch.  However, hang on to tasks you should have let go of long ago, and you stagnate your success.  When you need a task complete, look to the personality and experience of your team in order to decide which employee would be best suited for the task.
 
Productivity Tip #4: Build a bigger team!  It2019s a simple concept, really.  The more team members you have producing, the more work you2019ll generate, and hopefully, the more money you2019ll bring in for your business.  Hiring additional team members is one of the most effective ways to increase productivity for your business.  For lower priority or common tasks you should be able to find someone at a reasonable rate.  However, for senior or high-priority positions, you2019ll obviously need to hire experienced professionals. 
 
As a basic productivity rule, you should NEVER be answering your phone, doing bookkeeping or sending invoices.  You should be spending your time devoted to driving income, while your team members tend to the basic tasks.
 
As you can see, there are several ways to increase the productivity of your business.  These tips are simple, yet effective ways of instilling the principles of productivity in your team.

Take these four tips and turn them into four separate weekly goals to be achieved within the next month.  Write down specific actions you can take to achieve each weekly goal and put them in your calendar so they cannot be ignored.

            <title>Eliminate or at least Reduce Time Wasters and Distractions</title>
            <description>Eliminate or at least Reduce Time Wasters and Distractions in Your Life – 

Anyone who has a demanding career or runs their own business has to practice excellent time management, effective delegation and learning to say the word, “No.” It’s just not possible to maintain the simple life while achieving a high level of success.  And with today’s technology, it’s harder to hide when you need a break.  Your email inbox is dinging, your cell phone is ringing and your spouse is trying to call you on the car phone because your cell line is busy.  It is at this point that you have to filter the input so you can begin to regain control over your life.  As good as you think you may be with your time management; there are always “time-wasters” that can be eliminated from your daily life.  

The goal is to slow down and be focused on the highest pay-off activities that will produce the results you desire in the timeframe you want – personally and professionally.  The goal is not to figure out how to move faster.  It’s impossible to create more hours in the day and it’s simply not healthy to run at full tilt constantly.  

Eliminate the time-wasters in your life to improve your quality of life and your overall success.

Aim for what you want each and every day!

            <itunes:summary>Eliminate or at least Reduce Time Wasters and Distractions in Your Life – 

Anyone who has a demanding career or runs their own business has to practice excellent time management, effective delegation and learning to say the word, “No.” It’s just not possible to maintain the simple life while achieving a high level of success.  And with today’s technology, it’s harder to hide when you need a break.  Your email inbox is dinging, your cell phone is ringing and your spouse is trying to call you on the car phone because your cell line is busy.  It is at this point that you have to filter the input so you can begin to regain control over your life.  As good as you think you may be with your time management; there are always “time-wasters” that can be eliminated from your daily life.  

The goal is to slow down and be focused on the highest pay-off activities that will produce the results you desire in the timeframe you want – personally and professionally.  The goal is not to figure out how to move faster.  It’s impossible to create more hours in the day and it’s simply not healthy to run at full tilt constantly.  

Eliminate the time-wasters in your life to improve your quality of life and your overall success.

Aim for what you want each and every day!

            <title>3 Tips for Building a Team that Builds Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 3 Tips for Building a Team that Builds Success.

If you want to learn how to build a team that builds success, you will want to take a look at the big picture.  Take any successful entrepreneur, and behind him or her, you will find a well-suited team of supportive, knowledgeable, and energetic members all dedicated to increasing the success of the business.

Tip #1 for building a team that builds success.  If you2019re trying to understand how to build a team that builds success, you should first pinpoint the mission of the business.  Only when you have a clear understanding, as a leader, of the mission of the business, can you build the right team.  When you can clearly identify and emotionally connect with the mission, you are able to identify the right people who are best-suited to support the success of the business.

Depending on the mission statement of the business, you may need to focus on building a team of creatives, analytics, intellectuals, or spiritualists.  For example, a PR (public relations) firm wouldn2019t necessarily build a team of spiritualists; that personality would be better suited for a business that is motivational or inspirationally based.  A PR firm would more likely hire creatives and intellectuals.  Another example of personality matching would be an accounting firm; they would look to building a team of analytical members, not necessarily creatives or spirituals. 

Always start with the mission of the business, and then build your team.  Let2019s say you need an assistant to travel with you to help you with live events such as seminars and guest appearances.  An important personality factor would be to ensure the team member has the following qualities:
2022	reliable and punctual
2022	great organizer
2022	keeps you calm under times of stress
2022	takes care of the small details so you don2019t have to
2022	loves traveling
2022	love meeting new people
2022	has a personable, magnetic personality 

Tip #2 for building a team that builds success.  Think about the areas of your business where you struggle and could obviously use the help.  Make a list of those tasks you would like or need help with and then look for those strengths in potential candidates.

Additionally, take into consideration the kind of personality you tend to gravitate towards.  Do you enjoy being with people who are: Funny?  Serious?  Energetic?  Go-Getter?  Talker or silent-type?  Make a list of the kind of personality you tend to enjoy the most and then look for those additional traits in candidates.  

Unfortunately, interviews are not the ideal situations to explore personality traits, since potential candidate are generally nervous, but you could ask them to complete a personality profile as part of the application process.  There are several sources for free or low-cost personality screens, but the Myers-Briggs Personality (MBP) Test is best suited for career related insight.

Are you worried about how a potential candidate will fit in with an existing team?  While this is a viable consideration, it should not make or break your decision.  You, better than anyone, knows what your business needs to succeed.  The bottom line is that your team needs to learn how to work as team - and you should support them in achieving that goal.  If by chance you have a team with conflict, do not let it go unnoticed.  Address it immediately by listening to the concerns of the team and then offering constructive solutions.  

Tip #3 for building a team that builds success.  When building a team that builds success, you should have a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each individual member - including your own!  

You may have to do some experimenting to find the right match, but if you pay attention, you will build a team that supports you - and each other.  For example, say a team member is great behind the scenes, but chokes in public settings.  They may be better suited in the office, responsible for administrative tasks such as bookkeeping, emails and answering phones.  At the same time, if you have a team member that gets bored easily, appoint them to be your assistant.  Take them with you on the road, give them a variety of duties that change from day to day, and put them on the spot with last minute errands.  That will keep them on their toes, and their boredom at bay.  

You2019ll find that your business runs far more efficiently when you have properly assigned your team members to tasks that suit their personality and feed their interests.  Boredom and complacency is one of the fastest ways to kill the success of your business.  

As a business owner, it is important to be observant of the strengths and weaknesses of your team.  This is why it2019s vital to keep a running strength and weakness list for you and your team.  Revisit the list at least once per quarter and update it as needed.  Consistently refine processes and procedures that employ the strengths of you and your team, while minimizing the weaknesses.  The more consistent you are in this endeavor the more efficient and effective your business will grow.

            <description>Become a Master of Change

Let’s talk about 4 tips on how YOU can become a master of change and put yourself in a higher probability position to achieve your goals.

1. Inaction and Resistance Carries Bigger Consequences - Learn to be open to creating new and exciting adventures that change will bring.

2. Focus on the Desired End Result - Focus on where you want to be when the change is complete.  The mind has an uncanny way of being a goal-achieving machine and will create your reality based on the thoughts you are focused upon.  

3. Rationalize Your Fear - Fear is a natural response, but try to identify what it is you are afraid of.  Fear is usually the result of our mind creating hypothetical dramas that have no base in reality.   

4. Break it into Manageable Pieces - For major changes, break it down into smaller manageable pieces.  It's much easier to identify a solution when you can apply a strategy to deal with each step. 

Apply these 4 tips to help you become a master of change.

4. Break it into Manageable Pieces - For major changes, break it down into smaller manageable pieces.  It's much easier to identify a solution when you can apply a strategy to deal with each step. 

Apply these 4 tips to help you become a master of change.

            <title>“I Don’t Have Enough People To See”</title>
            <description>Have you ever thought or said to yourself, “I Don’t Have Enough People To See”…because if I did, I would be making a lot more money? 

When I have people say this to me, I ask them to do a simple exercise. For example, when Joe said to me, I don’t have enough people to see. I asked him to make a list of everyone he has met or knows. This means everyone from your dentist to your doctor, to your ophthalmologist, to parents you have met through your children being in school, church members – EVERYONE.  He did that one night and came back with just under 300 names.  Now, I am not saying this is common but the point is that you know people that you just haven’t thought about knowing that you could see.

Sit down and make your list and see how many people you know who could refer you to other people that you could potentially do business with. I think you will be amazed at how many end up on your list.

            <title>3 Tough Situations and How to Deal with Them</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 3 Tough Situations and How to Deal with Them and the Benefits of Telling the Truth.

The importance of telling the truth in business is paramount.  Clients pay for your products or services because they are looking for significant and necessary results in their lives, not to waste their money on empty promises.  In business, it2019s important to keep in mind that clients are depending on you, and that starts with telling the truth in business. 

You may be in business to make money, but your clients buy to get results your products and services provide.  Listen in on three tough situations you2019re likely to encounter in business and how to best deal with them. 

I cannot stress the importance of telling the truth in business enough.  The benefits of telling the truth will earn the loyalty of clients and garner the respect of colleagues.  When you tell the truth and conduct your business ethically, you won2019t live in fear or guilt; nor will you have to keep track of when you lie and when you tell the truth.  It is not always easy; however, it is a better choice that is easier to live with for most people.

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful 2013 personally and professionally.

            <title>Are You a Procrastinator?  Stop it!</title>
            <description>There’s nothing wrong with taking a break, but you know procrastination when you see it.  Here’s how to recognize the signs of procrastination and stop the cycle of excuses and delays so you can achieve more success in life and in business.

If you have ever been a leader, manager, or business owner with employees, you’ve experienced what it’s like delegating an important task under deadline.  From experience, you’ve probably learned who you can trust to complete the task well, and on time, when others fall short.

Have you ever delegated a time-sensitive task to an employee only to find them making excuses, waiting until the last minute, or wasting time when they should be working on your project?

It probably got you fired up.

So here’s a question for you: If you don’t tolerate procrastination from others, why would you ever tolerate procrastination from yourself?

            <title>The Art of Delegation for Business Owners</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about The Art of Delegation for Business Owners.  Delegation for business owners is a must-do for success!  When you can hand over your administrative tasks and projects off to an able assistant or employee, you can focus on more important tasks that only you can do to grow your business and increase revenue.  The art of delegation is an essential part of establishing a growing business.  

Delegation allows you to eliminate the low-priority tasks so you can free up time to focus on the high-payoff producing tasks.  Clearly, this can allow you to focus on increasing your revenue, and it can also free up time to center your energy towards expanding your business.  When your business continues to grow, eventually reaching another plateau, you may find it necessary to hire more assistants or outsource more tasks. 

Implementing the art of delegation to your current business model can lead to an increase in business and an immense decrease in stress for you.  Delegation for business owners is the single most efficient way to run your business without having to spread yourself thin.  You don2019t need to hire an army worth of employees or contractors, just delegate the tasks that are hindering you from increasing your revenue!  Do what you do best and let someone else do the rest.

            <title>Persistence: The Commonality of Champions</title>
            <description>If you look upon history, you’ll find that the notable quality that exists in all champions is persistence.

The path you walk will not always be easy, but you have to continue to persist.  Even in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds, you must keep putting one foot in front of the other, because there are lessons to be learned along the way, all of which will support your success.

Whenever you confront an obstacle or roadblock, step back and emotionally detach yourself from the situation.  It’s much easier to think of ways to go around, under or over the obstacle when you let go of the frustration.  This may take some practice, but try this exercise: imagine a friend is the one facing the challenge(s), and you are simply providing ideas how to help them overcome the obstacle.  When you are solution-oriented, you focus on the possibilities, not the impossibilities.

In truth, nothing is impossible, and change is inevitable.  Knowing this, you can take persistent steps in faith, with the wisdom that nothing stays the same, and at some time in the future your current obstacles will dissolve.

            <description>How badly do you want to achieve your goals and dreams? 
The only thing that separates you from your future and your current reality is choice.  Do you choose the life you currently have, or do you choose the life you want to have?  The choice is yours.  Your dreams are real and your goals are possible.  Commit to them and they will become a reality.

Start this moment by deciding what it is you really want in your life.  Write it on a piece of paper (remember to include exact dates of when you want to achieve your goals by – that is month, day and year) and know it is possible, if you really want it.  Begin making only those choices that support your goals and take action!  Nothing will come of nothing - you must take action to get from where you are to where you want to be.  Keep in mind that what got you to where you are today probably isn’t going to get you to where you want to be so you will probably have to make new and different choices going forward. 

How badly do you want to achieve your goals and dreams?

            <title>4 Tips for Building Self Esteem for Business Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Tips for Building Self Esteem for Business Success.

If you’ve struggled with self-esteem throughout your life, it may be a bit challenging to start creating confidence now in your business, but I assure you, even you can build self-esteem and succeed in your endeavors!  Let’s talk about 4 Tips for Building Self Esteem for Business Success.

You can improve self-esteem in business by maintaining a professional appearance, working on the way you present yourself and gaining experience.  Chances are, you may feel a little nervous each time you make a sales pitch or meet a potential client in person for the first time.  The important thing to remember is not to let the nervousness stop you.  Just for the moment, forget about the sale and focus on your talent.  When you can remember that you can do it, and probably do it well, the anxiety of “making the sale” will not even be in your mind.  

With time and experience, your confidence and self-esteem will continue to grow until speaking with clients feels as natural as a conversation with a friend.  The sooner you can embrace your confidence, the sooner your self-esteem will carry you to business success.

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.  Go to http://www.accountabilitycoach.com/landing/ and get 3 FREE gifts including a special report on 10 Power Tips for Getting Focused, Organized, and Achieving Your Goals Now.   Join the Silver Inner Circle (IT’S FREE) and receive 10% off on all products and services in addition to having access to many assessments and complimentary resources so you can begin achieving your goals in the timeframe you want, so you can have the life you desire.  Get started today by going to http://www.accountabilitycoach.com/coaching-store/inner-circle-store/ and Join the FREE Silver Inner Circle.

            <description>Fear is Not an Excuse!
Fear is never an excuse for not taking action.  You are exactly where you are right now because you have been too fearful to step outside your comfort zone.  To get to where you want to be - you have to feel the fear and do it anyway.  After you take action, you will wonder what you were so afraid of in the first place. The fear is only temporary, while the benefits of taking action last forever. 

So step outside your comfort zone and start taking action on those things you were afraid to do in the past.  The time is now and you are looking forward into your future.  Don’t let fear be your excuse any longer.  Welcome it and achieve your goals sooner.

            <title>Do You Truly Want to Achieve Your Goals Badly Enough?</title>
            <description>What’s the difference between someone who achieves their goals and someone who just dreams about them?  The starting point is always their level of desire, and how bad they want it.  Try to remember a time when you heard how someone defied all the odds and achieved something that seemed impossible.  You might have been stunned by their sheer determination to achieve their goal.  What gave them their determination?  They wanted it bad enough.  Their desire led to a choice which set their desire into motion.  They learned to make only those choices that supported their goals.  And if they can do it, you can too.  Achieving your goals doesn’t have anything to do with where you’ve been; you can always get to where you want to be - if you want it bad enough.

Try this exercise.  Think about something you really want.  Maybe you want a better job, more money, or to be more fit.  Whatever it is, make sure it’s something you really want.  Close your eyes for a moment and imagine how you would feel already having achieved it.  Feels great, doesn’t it?  

You have to want your dream life bad enough to make a choice.  That choice is to live a life that makes you feel great.

            <title>Is your Business Really Focused on Client Satisfaction?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Is your Business Really Focused on Client Satisfaction?  Is your Business Really Client-Centered?

There are many factors that go into building a successful business.  However, one of the most important, yet one of the most ignored, is focusing on creating client satisfaction.  Create a client-centered business and you’ll ensure that your business gets only rave reviews, while setting it up for success. 

Are your clients’ interests at the core of your business?  If not, your business will remain at a standstill for years to come.  Many business owners have the perception that they run a client-centered business, but in reality, they have gotten into a bad habit of putting their own personal interests in front of their clients’.  Yes, it is true that you should have a personal interest and passion for your business, but your interest is not what drives sales.  Meeting your clients’ needs and delivering stellar client service is what drives sales and generates revenue.

Smart business owners know that running a client-centered business is necessary in order to stay ahead of the competition.  After all, when you focus your efforts on client satisfaction, your clients will become your biggest free marketing tool.  Not only will they become lifetime clients, but they will also refer you to friends, family members, and colleagues any chance they get.  Word of mouth, any successful business owner will tell you, is the most powerful marketing tool available.

If you’re focused on client satisfaction, then all of your clients will likely become lifetime clients and become a free source of marketing when they refer their friends, family, coworkers, and everyone they know to you.  Continue to be open to making changes that can enhance being client-centered and you will improve the opportunity to be successful. When you run a client centered business, you will run a business set up for success.

            <itunes:summary>Today we are going to talk about Is your Business Really Focused on Client Satisfaction?  Is your Business Really Client-Centered?

There are many factors that go into building a successful business.  However, one of the most important, yet one of the most ignored, is focusing on creating client satisfaction.  Create a client-centered business and you’ll ensure that your business gets only rave reviews, while setting it up for success. 

Are your clients’ interests at the core of your business?  If not, your business will remain at a standstill for years to come.  Many business owners have the perception that they run a client-centered business, but in reality, they have gotten into a bad habit of putting their own personal interests in front of their clients’.  Yes, it is true that you should have a personal interest and passion for your business, but your interest is not what drives sales.  Meeting your clients’ needs and delivering stellar client service is what drives sales and generates revenue.

Smart business owners know that running a client-centered business is necessary in order to stay ahead of the competition.  After all, when you focus your efforts on client satisfaction, your clients will become your biggest free marketing tool.  Not only will they become lifetime clients, but they will also refer you to friends, family members, and colleagues any chance they get.  Word of mouth, any successful business owner will tell you, is the most powerful marketing tool available.

If you’re focused on client satisfaction, then all of your clients will likely become lifetime clients and become a free source of marketing when they refer their friends, family, coworkers, and everyone they know to you.  Continue to be open to making changes that can enhance being client-centered and you will improve the opportunity to be successful. When you run a client centered business, you will run a business set up for success.

            <title>Confidence – Use it to Your Advantage</title>
            <description>Confidence will improve both your personal and professional life.  Some people seem as if they have all the confidence in the world, while the rest of us are left to figure out how to muster it, and if we have any reason to be confident at all.   Having a clear understanding of the actual talents you possess will help you understand the value you bring to every situation.   Confidence will improve your self-esteem, your performance and trust in yourself to do even more. 

If you want to increase your confidence but are not sure how to do it, explore these simple steps and you'll be on your way to more confidence and a better life.
•	Identify Your Talents (Natural and Learned)
•	Identify Your Weaknesses
•	Commit to Continual Learning
•	Learn to Trust Yourself Through Successful Action

A word of caution; do not up “sell” if you cannot deliver.  Over promising and under delivering will damage your credibility and reputation.  It's OK to stretch yourself a little, but be honest in all situations.  The truth is powerful. 

Stretch yourself, rise to each occasion, and finish strong.  Go get 'em!

            <title>How to Get Things Done with a Master Task List</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about How to Get Things Done with a Master Task List.

Focusing on many responsibilities is a vital part of successfully running your business successfully.  But how do you know which tasks need to be completed immediately and which tasks can wait?  You have so many things you need to do that it can be very overwhelming.  If you focus on the less important tasks, while the most important go unnoticed or forgotten about, you could be sabotaging your overall success.  Fortunately, you can get a grip on your essential tasks by learning how to get things done with a master task list.  We will discuss some valuable insight on how to use a master task list to increase your success. 

What is a Master Task List?
How do you use a Master Task List 

Understanding how to use a master task list can only be done by truly understanding why you need to create one.  A master task list has one purpose: to help you complete the key tasks vital to running your business at its optimal efficiency and effectiveness. 

The goal is to accomplish the tasks on your list as soon as you can, so you can clear your head of the distractions.  To aid in that, place the tasks from your master task list into a calendar where you can map out time limits for each task.

Remember to delegate the unimportant or low-priority tasks to an assistant or employee.  You, as the business owner, should only be focusing on the most vital tasks that are best suited to be handled by you.  Everything else is trivial, temporary, or low-priority, and can likely be delegated to an assistant.

            <description>Are you the driver or passenger in your life?  Don’t think for a second that sitting in the passenger seat is going to get you where you want to be.  If you want to be successful, you have to make plans, take action and commit to achieving your goals.  Surrendering the wheel to the “luck of life” will not give you peace of mind, but it will mean you’re in for a rough ride.  When you give up control, you are at the mercy of whatever life throws at you, and you will most likely get everything you do not want.  Success only comes from those who drive their own life.  Don’t just take things for granted.  Create a game plan and focus on what you can control.  YOU and your actions!

Consider the results if you do or don’t take action.

When you give up control, you are at the mercy of whatever life throws at you, and you will most likely get everything you do not want.  Success only comes from those who drive their own life.  Don’t just take things for granted.  Create a game plan and focus on what you can control.  YOU and your actions!

Consider the results if you do or don’t take action.

            <title>Think Big and Grow Your Business</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Think Big and Grow Your Business.

Contrary to common belief, most successful entrepreneurs aren’t born into money or possess above average IQ’s.  Most of them are self-made and many of them do not even have college degrees.  It doesn’t take genius to become successful; it only takes the proper mindset, desire, and commitment.  

How do you gain the proper mindset?  By learning to think outside of the box.

If you quit tending to your business, would it run on its own?  The likely (and logical) answer is no.  

If your business cannot run without you - you’ve got to start thinking outside the box!  One of the quickest ways to grow your business is to gain leverage.  You do that by creating a business that does not solely rely on you.  

Frankly, building passive income isn’t as difficult as many people make it out to be.  It comes down to being able to think outside the box and expand your mindset to accommodate a successful reality. The goal is to create a source of residual recurring income in the least time investment possible. 

Another key to growing your business is to delegate the time-consuming, non-income driving tasks to someone else.  

Making the transition from where you are to where you want to be starts with thinking outside the box.  Remember, the key is to leverage your business so it is not dependent on your daily attention.  Create residual income streams and delegate non-income driving tasks to a virtual assistant or employee.  Follow these tips and your business will grow beyond your wildest dreams.

            <title>Can I Succeed Telling the Truth?</title>
            <description>Not only can you succeed by telling the truth, you can thrive telling the truth. The reason is that you will attract clients with lots of money who can handle the truth, and prefer the truth.

The question on the table is whether you really can succeed if you tell the truth. The answer is yes, absolutely you can. It can actually give you a competitive advantage in a market glutted by people full of hot air. Most people fear nobody wants to hear the truth, but of course they do! And the ones who want to hear the truth will be your best and most lucrative clients. Most successful people respond to bare-bald-buck-naked facts, because most successful people got that way by remaining grounded in reality. 

Jack Welch, arguably the greatest CEO of our times, held the philosophy, “Tell me the truth, and tell me early.” If something happened and you knew and didn’t tell him about it, you were fired. But if you came to him early and told him, “You know what? This whole project is screwed up, and I don’t know what to do about it,” you’d go a long way with Jack Welch.

Truthfulness and believability always have appeal. If your claims aren’t inflated, if you trust your clients and sincerely believe they deserve the truth and can handle reality, they will trust you in return. As Emerson said, “Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great.” The truth has power. If you tell the truth, you begin to play in a new league; you walk away from the games of salesmanship and into the realm of reality as a Trusted Advisor.

Tell the truth and get and keep great clients.

If your claims aren’t inflated, if you trust your clients and sincerely believe they deserve the truth and can handle reality, they will trust you in return. As Emerson said, “Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great.” The truth has power. If you tell the truth, you begin to play in a new league; you walk away from the games of salesmanship and into the realm of reality as a Trusted Advisor.

Tell the truth and get and keep great clients.

            <title>Are you an Effective Leader?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Are you an Effective Leader?

Understandably, most businesses are focused on nurturing the relationships with their clients, but running a successful business is also dependent on effective management and leadership skills.  If your employees aren’t functioning to the best of their abilities, your business won’t be either.  So, ask yourself, are you an effective team leader? 

Do you lead by example?

Are you compassionate and patient, yet firm?  

Are you an approachable leader?  

Do your actions build team loyalty? 

Being an effective leader takes time and lots of personal development.  Honestly, some people will never be effective leaders because it doesn’t suit their personality.  However, as an entrepreneur and business owner, it is vital that you become the best leader you can be so your business, and your team, can grow personally and professionally.  Ultimately, how far you want to take your success depends on you.  When you commit to evolving into the best person you can be, your success follows suit - and so does your team.

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

            <title>4 Tips for Understanding How Fitness Impacts your Business</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Tips for Understanding How Fitness Impacts your Business.

Business owners tend to become all-consumed in their business, allowing their physical fitness fall to the bottom of their priority list.  While a common occurrence, this habit may sabotage the success of your business - and your health.  Being an entrepreneur takes lots of energy, more than many other careers, and being healthy and physically fit is vital to maintaining the valuable source of energy you need to keep up with your business.  

If you’re not fit, neither is your business!
Do you understand how fitness impacts your business?  If you’re not fit, neither is your business.  

As an entrepreneur, you’re always on the go.  This likely means you don’t have the chance to sit down and enjoy a proper meal as much as you’d like.  While refueling on empty calories may seem necessary and harmless, feasting on the wrong foods can actually cause your already low energy to plummet.  

Let’s be honest, most entrepreneurs seem to drink more caffeine and energy drinks than they should.  If you fall into that group, put down the caffeine down.  Instead of downing an energy drink, reach for a cup of water 

As an entrepreneur, you more than likely lead a hectic lifestyle.  Attending meetings, managing your business, and constantly being on the run require you to be in tiptop physical shape.  Refuel your body with nutritious food so that it can in turn provide you with the energy for leading such jam-packed days.  The bottom line is that if you’re not fit, neither is your business.

            <description>Persistence is to success as excuses are to failure.  Never, never give up - there is always a way.

If you want more, you WILL find a way, because there always IS a way.  With persistence and consistent action you will make it happen.  If you don't believe me, keep listening.

The road to success isn’t always easy - but it isn’t always hard.  There may be times when you have to talk yourself through periods of self-doubt, and there will definitely be times when you defy the odds.  Never, never give up because there is always a way to achieve your goals and experience the life you truly desire.  Stay focused on the goals and track your progress.

Every action of every day between now and your goal achievement counts.  Take action, bring your best, find solutions to your obstacles, and say “Next!” to your rejections.  Feel good about how far you’ve come and be persistent until you achieve your goals!

            <title>5 Benefits for Taking Action to Increase Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 5 Benefits for Taking Action to Increase Success.

New business owners are especially prone to delay taking action in their business, because the unknown outcome can be pretty intimidating.  However, even seasoned entrepreneurs will put off taking action, simply due to the fact they lack the free time to juggle another endeavor.  

So what to do when you know that taking action would benefit your business, but you can’t seem to implement much needed change?  Ask yourself these questions:

1.	Do I want to increase my income (grow my business)?
2.	Do I want to grow my client base?
3.	Do I want to create more free time?

If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, then taking action now is the best thing you can do for you – and your business.  Just for a moment, let’s go back to the reason(s) you became an entrepreneur?  Although there may be many reasons, they are all probably related to the following benefits:

•	More free time
•	Work from home
•	The freedom to make money doing what you enjoy
•	Independence, flexibility, and freedom with schedule
•	Unlimited earning potential
•	Didn’t want to work for anyone

Sound familiar?  

“If comfort is your goal, success in NOT in your future.” – Bill Bachrach, CSP, CPAE

“If you are bored with life, if you don’t get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you don’t have enough goals.” – Lou Holtz

Whether you are new to the entrepreneur arena or a seasoned business owner, it’s important to think creatively.  Taking action from a fresh perspective not only encourages your success, but the success of your business as well.

            <title>Getting People "in the Mood"</title>
            <description>Do people buy and make decisions on logic or emotion?

Understanding your clients' emotions--and knowing how they drive key decisions--is critical to building successful high-trust relationships with them.

Most accomplished professionals already know how great a role emotion plays in people's decisions.  And people are emotional, especially about their decisions and their money.

What would happen if you could predictably create that mood?
Here are five simple steps for using questions to shape the mood of any conversation or meeting.

1.  Decide what emotional mood you want to create.  Do you want curiosity, excitement, concern, connection, or what?

2. Experience that emotion yourself.  Get yourself "in the mood" before you try to bring your clients there.

3. Think of a time or circumstance that creates that emotion for your client.  

4. Ask a question.  Be sure it's a question you know will elicit that positive emotion: 

5. Be congruent!  Don't just "act" as if you feel a certain way.  If you want to create excitement, then be excited.

Your whole objective in influencing people's emotions is to create an enjoyable experience for them.	How can you apply this concept in your life to achieve even better results?

            <title>Grow your Business by Thinking Big: Mindset Is Important</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Grow your Business by Thinking Big: Mindset Makes all the Difference.

Whether or not you realize it, your earnings will always be in line with your mindset.  Think big and you will get much bigger results; think small and…well, you can guess what that brings.  The key to growing your business is thinking big!

What happens when you think small?

What happens when you think big?

Wealthy people think differently, and that’s no secret, but, what may not be so obvious is how their mindset directly affects their ability to continually grow.  

Adjusting your Mindset

If you want big results, you have to learn to think big.  By becoming a go getter and ignoring your inhibitions you’ll become more confident and therefore be able to accomplish business growth.  You’ve got to push the limits, step outside your comfort zone, and reach farther.  Here’s how you start:

There’s certainly nothing wrong with the thinking small, if you’ve been happy with everything you’ve settled for so far.  You will rarely get what you want and you will certainly not get what you deserve when you think small.  You absolutely deserve much more than what you’ve been getting.  Thinking big is about realizing your potential and getting what you deserve instead of limiting yourself.  There is nothing stopping you from growing your business and thinking big - the ability to change lies within you.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Today we are going to talk about Grow your Business by Thinking Big: Mindset Makes all the Difference.

Whether or not you realize it, your earnings will always be in line with your mindset.  Think big and you will get much bigger results; think small and…well, you can guess what that brings.  The key to growing your business is thinking big!

What happens when you think small?

What happens when you think big?

Wealthy people think differently, and that’s no secret, but, what may not be so obvious is how their mindset directly affects their ability to continually grow.  

Adjusting your Mindset

If you want big results, you have to learn to think big.  By becoming a go getter and ignoring your inhibitions you’ll become more confident and therefore be able to accomplish business growth.  You’ve got to push the limits, step outside your comfort zone, and reach farther.  Here’s how you start:

There’s certainly nothing wrong with the thinking small, if you’ve been happy with everything you’ve settled for so far.  You will rarely get what you want and you will certainly not get what you deserve when you think small.  You absolutely deserve much more than what you’ve been getting.  Thinking big is about realizing your potential and getting what you deserve instead of limiting yourself.  There is nothing stopping you from growing your business and thinking big - the ability to change lies within you.

            <title>Persistence:  The Commonality of Champions</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Persistence:  The Commonality of Champions

Look upon history, and you’ll find that the notable quality that exists in all champions is persistence.

The path you walk will not always be easy, but you have to continue to persist.  Even in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds, you must keep putting one foot in front of the other, because there are lessons to be learned along the way, all of which will support your success.

When you are solution-oriented, you focus on the possibilities, not the impossibilities. In truth, nothing is impossible, and change is inevitable.  Knowing this, you can take persistent steps in faith, with the wisdom that nothing stays the same, and at some time in the future your current obstacles will dissolve.

The most important thing to remember about persistence is to trust your own intuition.  Don’t listen to the critics and silence the self-doubt.  If you have a feeling that something is going to work, even if everyone says it won’t, persist in your goal until you achieve it.  There is core genius in you - and that is the stuff that champions are born from.

            <title>Use a Prioritized Action List to Keep You Focused</title>
            <description>Most people I coach don’t initially have a Master Task List, Prioritized Action List, or one place where they keep all the activities required to achieve their goals.  How do you know what to do every day if you don’t have a list?  How do you know you are on track to achieving your goals if you don’t have a list?  How do you remember what to do if you don’t have a list?

I call it a Prioritized Action List (PAL) for a reason – all the activities should be prioritized and all in one place.  
  
Most people have sticky notes and pieces of paper everywhere and don’t have one single place to put everything they need to do to give themselves the highest probability of achieving their goals. They are afraid they will forget something, they are afraid they won’t remember something. These things in their head keep them up at night and a little on edge because they want to remember everything they need to do to get their job done well and make the kind of money they deserve.  If you are like most people I coach, you will feel more in control and more focused, not to mention more productive when you have a Prioritized Action List and consistently utilize it.  When you follow the activities on your list, you know you are having an impact on achievement of your goals. That’s a great feeling! You should have it more often don’t you think?  Begin using a PAL today and see how it can help you be even more successful.

            <title>Effective Time Management in Key to Your Success</title>
            <description>I can’t tell you how many people I begin working with who don’t effectively utilize their calendar. When I ask to review what is on their calendar it is many times empty. I ask them what are the chances you are actually doing the most important activities to help you achieve your goals when there is nothing on your calendar. They honestly tell me not good. They wonder what to do or they muddle through activities and then wonder why they don’t hit their goals. Sound like anyone you might know?

One way is to use a Master Task List or Prioritized Action Plan to have all your activities in one place – not on stickie notes here and there or pieces of paper laying all around you or floating around in your head. Everything goes in one place and you review it frequently. This helps keep you focused on what you have to do and in a priority order.

You will be amazed at how much more productive you are and how much more focused you are and how much more on track to achieving your goals you are.

            <title>How to Get the Most Out of Life and Live With No Regrets</title>
            <description> 
Today we are going to talk about How to Get the Most Out of Life and Live With No Regrets

Are you living life to the fullest?  If life ended tomorrow, would you feel as though you have absolutely lived it to the tilt, with no regrets?  If you are like most of us, you still have that “someday” list of dreams that haven’t yet come true tucked away in a drawer.

Sadly, life doesn’t have to be that way, but very few people get the most out of life before it’s over.  There are, however, a select few that seem to have the philosophy of life figured out and live every day without regret.  You know, the kind of people that seem at peace, move at a comfortable pace, and don’t seem to be distracted by the small stuff.  They accept others without judgment and walk with an open heart while the rest of us get caught up in the rush of daily life, with no real connection to ourselves or anyone else.  We’re so busy, we don’t even have time to think about what’s missing, let alone trying to figure out how to get the most out of life.

But what if the solution to living with no regrets was as simple as a single question?

Let’s talk about some ways you can begin to change your life and to get the most out it!

Regrets are a waste of time – you can’t change the past.  As one of my clients says: “Put your big girl panties on and deal with it.”  Create your game plan to achieve your goals this year so you can enjoy what is truly important to you in life.   Start today!

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

They accept others without judgment and walk with an open heart while the rest of us get caught up in the rush of daily life, with no real connection to ourselves or anyone else.  We’re so busy, we don’t even have time to think about what’s missing, let alone trying to figure out how to get the most out of life.

But what if the solution to living with no regrets was as simple as a single question?

Let’s talk about some ways you can begin to change your life and to get the most out it!

Regrets are a waste of time – you can’t change the past.  As one of my clients says: “Put your big girl panties on and deal with it.”  Create your game plan to achieve your goals this year so you can enjoy what is truly important to you in life.   Start today!

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

Today we are going to talk about How to Get the Most Out of Life and Live With No Regrets

Are you living life to the fullest?  If life ended tomorrow, would you feel as though you have absolutely lived it to the tilt, with no regrets?  If you are like most of us, you still have that “someday” list of dreams that haven’t yet come true tucked away in a drawer.

Sadly, life doesn’t have to be that way, but very few people get the most out of life before it’s over.  There are, however, a select few that seem to have the philosophy of life figured out and live every day without regret.  You know, the kind of people that seem at peace, move at a comfortable pace, and don’t seem to be distracted by the small stuff.  They accept others without judgment and walk with an open heart while the rest of us get caught up in the rush of daily life, with no real connection to ourselves or anyone else.  We’re so busy, we don’t even have time to think about what’s missing, let alone trying to figure out how to get the most out of life.

            <title>Kick Your “Time-Wasters” Habits</title>
            <description>As good as you think you may be with your time management; there are always “time-wasters” that can be eliminated from your daily life.  
All the miscellaneous stuff that consumes your time with little or no return eventually must be eliminated from your schedule.   

When you think about it, what do all the time wasting activities you do every day cost you?

I suggest you try NOT CHECKING EMAIL FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. 
SCHEDULE TIME to handle your emails. It could be two times a day – at 11:00am and then at 4:00pm. You can set the autoresponder to tell people that you check it 2 times a day or not. Some people like to do this so people know when to expect a response back and some don’t care if they do this.

This one simple concept, of NOT checking email first thing in the morning, can help you stop wasting time in one area and focus on the activities you need to do in order to achieve your goals.  Don’t take my word for it, try it like my other coaching clients have and see what impact it has in your life.

            <title>Are You A Procrastinator?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Are You a Procrastinator?

There’s nothing wrong with taking a break, but you know procrastination when you see it.  Here’s how to recognize the signs of procrastination and stop the cycle of excuses and delays so you can achieve more success in life and in business.

Have you ever delegated a time-sensitive task to an employee only to find them making excuses, waiting until the last minute, or wasting time when they should be working on your project?

It probably got you fired up.

So here’s a question for you: If you don’t tolerate procrastination from others, why would you ever tolerate procrastination from yourself?

Will you choose to begin reducing procrastinating in your life so you can enjoy even greater successes or will you continue to let procrastination hold you back from reaching your true potential?  What has to happen next for you to stop letting procrastination be your excuse?

            <title>Top 3 Traits of Successful Leaders</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Top 3 Traits of Successful Leaders.

Do you ever wonder why certain businesses fail while similar businesses thrive in the same economic climate?  There are several commonalities shared between strategic and successful business owners.  The Top 3 Traits of Successful Leaders are centered on the internal operation of their business, analyzing current business practices and carving out an untapped niche in the market.  We are going to talk about the top qualities of successful leaders and learn how their businesses thrive, along with some action steps to helping you implement the concepts. 

It is true when they say that owning your own business is one of the toughest personal growth periods of your life.  You will not only become a business owner, you will become a leader, visionary, and savvy business strategist.  While these simultaneous roles are challenging, they will hopefully provide the springboard to a better you, a more successful you - and a successful business.

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

            <title>Take Action Now and Achieve Your Goals Sooner</title>
            <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you could have everything you want magically appear with the snap of a finger.  The only secret to achieving your goals comes down to one main thing -- taking action.  One of the benefits of taking action is that your movement is the very thing that bridges the gap between imagining a dream and manifesting it.  Action = Results!

The benefits of taking action far outweigh living a life that is using only a fraction of your potential and living with regret.  You can go from living a life you feel controlled in, to living a life you feel in control of.  

At this very moment, you have 3 choices in life.

Which do you choose?

The only secret to achieving your goals comes down to one main thing -- taking action.  One of the benefits of taking action is that your movement is the very thing that bridges the gap between imagining a dream and manifesting it.  Action = Results!

            <title>Real Life Isn’t Boring!  How to Live Life with No Regrets</title>
            <description>Life goes by so quickly – don’t miss out on the extraordinary opportunities you have to live life without regret!  Ask yourself this question, if you left this world tomorrow, would you feel as if you lived life to the fullest extent?

Most of us were taught that being an adult is about being responsible, and life is not about having fun.  You’re supposed to have all your fun when you’re a child, then “grow up” and live responsibly in the real world.  

I challenge you to break that false perception and create a new rule of your own.
If you could live life exactly as you wanted, what would you change?  Without even realizing it, you could probably come up with at least three things that would involve less work and more fun.  Go ahead, make your list right now.

            <title>3 Benefits of Increasing Success with Authenticity</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 3 Benefits of Increasing Success with Authenticity.

You’re likely familiar with the most common ways to increase your success, such as setting goals, staying focused, and becoming more efficient and productive, but did you know that authenticity can also increase your success?

You may believe that the best recipe for increasing success is to think and act like the rest, but in reality, blending in with the rest of the pack will only hinder your success.  As an entrepreneur, it is vital that you find your own unique voice and message, so that you are anything but just another business owner lost in the pack.

Success lies in distinguishing yourself from your competitors.  What do you bring to the table that your competitors don’t have?  

Take these steps to integrate authenticity into your business for improved performance and revenue.

            <description>We all know and I think we all would agree that communication is everything in business and in all of our relationships.  In order to enjoy an agreeable business and personal discussion, the communication level has to be excellent.  How does one communicate effectively?  Simply put, say what you mean, say it clearly, and say it with respect.  

Ask a lot of questions.  You can’t propose or present something without knowing where someone is or where they want to be to know if what you have to offer is a fit or not.

            <title>Top 6 Strategies for Dealing with Difficult Situations</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Top 6 Strategies for Dealing with Difficult Situations. 

Entrepreneurs are often juggling multiple stressful situations and if you let stress take over your life, you’re going to burn out and lose passion for your business.  Overcoming difficult issues with ease is an art that can be learned, simply by identifying effective strategies for dealing with difficult situations.  Once you learn the basics, you can implement them, in any difficult situation, to help you reach your desired end result. 

We are going to talk about 6 strategies to help you deal with difficult situations.

You can overcome difficult strategies with ease just by making a few changes to the way you handle tasks.  Once you identify strategies for dealing with difficult situations and implement them, you’ll be prepared to handle just about any tough situation that’s thrown your way.  It’s about focusing on the end result, breaking each task down into manageable steps, and altering the way you work to reach maximum productivity.

Remember, when you’re feeling overwhelmed, that is a sign to stop and evaluate the situation.  Tough situations are best dealt with calm and objectiveness.  If you are too emotionally involved, upset or angry, it may be best to let it go for the time being.  Take time to think and reflect upon your desired outcome and form your conversation around that goal.  If you are ready to address it in 15 minutes, great.  If you need 24 hours, that’s okay too.  The important thing to remember is to follow the six strategies to help you achieve your end result - however, long it takes.

            <title>Delegate! Delegate! Delegate!</title>
            <description>So many people I work with hold on to way too many activities that stop them from doing their highest pay-off activities that will put them in the highest probability position to achieve their goals.  

They continue to do work that they have always done because they have always done it, instead of delegating these tasks to someone else. This wastes a lot of time. Sometimes someone else can even do a better job at a task then you have done.  Start by making a list of everything someone else can do as you actually do things that don’t have to be done by you.  When I ask my clients, could someone else do the thing on their list we are talking about, they reluctantly tell you that yes someone else could do it.  

Even if you don’t currently have someone to delegate to you will begin to see how much you can delegate and how many things can really be given to someone else to do.

You may have two different people to delegate to because one person isn’t enough or can’t do all the different things that you currently are doing.  For example, you might need an assistant and a client service person or a marketing person and these might need to be two different people. 

Prioritize the list and give each item one at a time so not to overwhelm someone or give them too much if they already have a full time job. 

Think delegate when you are doing everything that you do and it will make you more productive and help you generate more revenue and even have more time off to do what you want to do.

            <title>Download Free Chapter of New Book, Live Life With No Regrets</title>
            <description>Today you are receiving something very special.  You will be given information at the end of this podcast to download a chapter of my brand new book, Live Life with No Regrets; How the Choices We Make Impact ourLlives. There is no charge to you when you do this.  I hope you get value from reading just one chapter.

Imagine reflecting on your past, from any point in your long, happy life, and having no regrets.  How did you get here?  How would you like to free yourself of past regrets and live a life where you have no regrets ever again? What would have to happen from this point going forward for you to live a life of no regrets?  

That’s why I wrote this book.  To help you choose to create the future you really want. Regrets are a waste of time anyway, as you can’t change the past.  So, let go of the past and decide to choose to live your life in a way where you will have no regrets from this day forward.  

Living a life with no regrets doesn’t mean perfection.  It means you know how to make the right choice every time, a choice that you will not regret. You think about the impact and outcome of a decision and know you can comfortably live with the choice you make. We don’t know the future. We only can make decisions based on what we do know at the present time.

Is a successful and happy life with few or no regrets a choice…?  Is success a choice or a chance collision of various uncontrollable factors? 

In studying self-improvement, we learn that we can’t change others, nor can we single-handedly change the world.  However, we do have the power to change our own lives. We are living a life we chose, based on the decisions we made in the past and will make into the future.

This is the single most important message in self-improvement.  You do not have to settle for what you think is life’s “role” for you.  You are not doomed to live a life you are unhappy living.  You are not obligated to do what others think you should do.  Any and all of these self-limiting beliefs can be overcome.  

You have the power to look for another job and make a positive change in your career.  You have the power to seek out higher education to follow a different career path.  You have the ability to define success for yourself and the capacity to achieve that pinnacle of success by working smart and exercising perseverance.  Success is a choice that comes from being intentional about living your life with the highest probability of achieving your goals so you can enjoy what is most important to you.  Success comes from choosing to live your life with purpose.  This is how you live a life with no regrets. 

You make your own choices. The choices you make will impact your life – positively or negatively, depending on the path you choose.  Choose to live your life with no regrets from this day forward.  You choose how and where to live.  If you are unhappy with any part of your life, choose to change it – and start today. 

If what you are currently doing doesn’t serve you, you can choose to change it right now.  When we change how we look at things, the things we look at change. 

You can choose to start by taking “baby” steps.  Start by having a day without regrets.  How about a business trip where you don’t have any regrets?  What would a vacation without regrets look like and feel like?  What would have to happen to have an argument or “touchy” conversation with your spouse or child without regrets?   How would you have a conversation with a client you don’t enjoy and not have any regrets?  How would you communicate with employees who may not be working to your expectations and not have any regrets?  Could you have a day of making everyday business decisions and personal choices without any regrets? 

What would a day without regrets look like and feel like? What would a week of no regrets look like and feel like? What would a month of no regrets look like and feel like?  Keep reading...

            <itunes:summary>Today you are receiving something very special.  You will be given information at the end of this podcast to download a chapter of my brand new book, Live Life with No Regrets; How the Choices We Make Impact ourLlives. There is no charge to you when you do this.  I hope you get value from reading just one chapter.

Imagine reflecting on your past, from any point in your long, happy life, and having no regrets.  How did you get here?  How would you like to free yourself of past regrets and live a life where you have no regrets ever again? What would have to happen from this point going forward for you to live a life of no regrets?  

That’s why I wrote this book.  To help you choose to create the future you really want. Regrets are a waste of time anyway, as you can’t change the past.  So, let go of the past and decide to choose to live your life in a way where you will have no regrets from this day forward.  

Living a life with no regrets doesn’t mean perfection.  It means you know how to make the right choice every time, a choice that you will not regret. You think about the impact and outcome of a decision and know you can comfortably live with the choice you make. We don’t know the future. We only can make decisions based on what we do know at the present time.

Is a successful and happy life with few or no regrets a choice…?  Is success a choice or a chance collision of various uncontrollable factors? 

In studying self-improvement, we learn that we can’t change others, nor can we single-handedly change the world.  However, we do have the power to change our own lives. We are living a life we chose, based on the decisions we made in the past and will make into the future.

This is the single most important message in self-improvement.  You do not have to settle for what you think is life’s “role” for you.  You are not doomed to live a life you are unhappy living.  You are not obligated to do what others think you should do.  Any and all of these self-limiting beliefs can be overcome.  

You have the power to look for another job and make a positive change in your career.  You have the power to seek out higher education to follow a different career path.  You have the ability to define success for yourself and the capacity to achieve that pinnacle of success by working smart and exercising perseverance.  Success is a choice that comes from being intentional about living your life with the highest probability of achieving your goals so you can enjoy what is most important to you.  Success comes from choosing to live your life with purpose.  This is how you live a life with no regrets. 

You make your own choices. The choices you make will impact your life – positively or negatively, depending on the path you choose.  Choose to live your life with no regrets from this day forward.  You choose how and where to live.  If you are unhappy with any part of your life, choose to change it – and start today. 

If what you are currently doing doesn’t serve you, you can choose to change it right now.  When we change how we look at things, the things we look at change. 

You can choose to start by taking “baby” steps.  Start by having a day without regrets.  How about a business trip where you don’t have any regrets?  What would a vacation without regrets look like and feel like?  What would have to happen to have an argument or “touchy” conversation with your spouse or child without regrets?   How would you have a conversation with a client you don’t enjoy and not have any regrets?  How would you communicate with employees who may not be working to your expectations and not have any regrets?  Could you have a day of making everyday business decisions and personal choices without any regrets? 

What would a day without regrets look like and feel like? What would a week of no regrets look like and feel like? What would a month of no regrets look like and feel like?  Keep reading...

            <title>Utilize a Proven System for Goal Achievement</title>
            <description>This is the best advice I can give you to help you achieve your goals in the timeframe you desire.
This is the most effective way to help make it easier to achieve your goals that I know of.

Have written goals (long range and short term).

Have a Prioritized Action List where everything you need to do is on this one list and in one place. The list is obviously in priority order – hence the name. 

Have a tracking spreadsheet of some kind where you track the activities you need to do in order to achieve your goals. You will have a goal for each activity that you think you need to do to achieve your goals. 

You will track your daily results against the activity you said you needed to do.

You will calendar your activities that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your goals. Follow your calendar. Stay focused. 

By using your goals document, master task list and activity tracking spreadsheet with your calendar, you be amazed at what you can achieve.

I work with people who make anywhere from $100,000 to $2Mil in personal income and they leverage these tools to help them be even more successful. Imagine how much more productive and focused you can be in you would use simple tools to help you.

You can work smarter and not harder. Part of working smarter is doing it right the first time.

My advice is to create these tools for you and begin today so you can achieve your goals and enjoy what is truly important to you in life.

            <title>Create a Goals List to Help You Achieve Your Goals</title>
            <description>If you don’t know where you ultimately want to be in life, how can you create a game plan to get you there?

Create a Long-Term Goal List – personal and professional – with specific goal dates for each is a good place to start.   

Once you have your long-term goal list, create a Yearly Goal List.  This Yearly goal list is  
a subset of your long-term goals. Whatever they are, remember to include specific dates down to the month, day and year.  

Now create a quarterly Goal List. Again these are a subset of your yearly goals and have specific dates for achieving them. Put them in priority order.

Create a Weekly Activity List. These are all the activities you need to do to be on track to achieving your goals in the timeframe you desire.  Review the list daily and make adjustments as necessary.  These are the things that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your long-range personal and business goals.  So what are you waiting for, create your list or brush off the one you started the first of the year and update it. Get busy so you can enjoy the kind of life you truly want and deserve.

Create a Long-Term Goal List – personal and professional – with specific goal dates for each is a good place to start.   

Once you have your long-term goal list, create a Yearly Goal List.  This Yearly goal list is  
a subset of your long-term goals. Whatever they are, remember to include specific dates down to the month, day and year.  

Now create a quarterly Goal List. Again these are a subset of your yearly goals and have specific dates for achieving them. Put them in priority order.

Create a Weekly Activity List. These are all the activities you need to do to be on track to achieving your goals in the timeframe you desire.  Review the list daily and make adjustments as necessary.  These are the things that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your long-range personal and business goals.  So what are you waiting for, create your list or brush off the one you started the first of the year and update it. Get busy so you can enjoy the kind of life you truly want and deserve.

            <title>Stop Wasting Time and Stay Laser Focused</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Stop Wasting Time and Stay Laser Focused.

Most entrepreneurs have a difficult time understanding exactly how to stop wasting time.  When you’re self employed, it’s easy to take a “short break” to surf the internet, check email, return a call, talk to a peer who stops by your office, or read blogs, but those “short breaks” can easily turn into hours of wasted time each day.  This includes unnecessary chats with colleagues, long lunches, or non-focused or misguided meetings that do not accomplish goals and resolve issues.

The success of your business venture depends on your ability to buckle down and learn how to stay focused.  We are going to talk about 3 essential steps to help you stop wasting time, stay focused and have productive work days so you can be on the path of achieving your goals. Enjoy the podcast.

            <title>Wheel of Life – Put your life into perspective</title>
            <description>Wouldn’t it be great to have even more balance in your life? Would you like to have that feeling of work / life balance more often?  

When someone begins with any of my programs, one of the first things they do is their Wheel of Life. This exercise helps them focus on goals in 8 areas of their life.  I believe in having a balanced and successful life.  Here’s how you would get started on making progress to creating even more balance in your life.  Go to www.AccountabilityCoach.com and complete the Wheel of Life exercise. You will find this exercise under the FREE Silver Membership section along with a number of other FREE resources and tools.

 This exercise will help you write down all your personal and professional goals, starting with your long-range goals and working your way back to what you have to do today to achieve these goals.

The Wheel of Life covers 8 areas of our life.
1.	Money
2.	Career
3.	Friends/Family
4.	Fun/Recreation
5.	Personal Growth/Spiritual Develoment
6.	Romance/Significant Other
7.	Physical Environment/Home
8.	Fitness/Health

You begin by rating your level of satisfaction, right now, with where you are today and NOT where you want to be.  After you rate each area and put a dot on the wheel where you rate yourself in each of the 8 areas, you then connect the dots.

            <title>5 Top Success Principles</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Top 5 Success Principles.

If you think creating a successful business may just be the most challenging goal you’ve ever taken on, you are probably correct.  Building a successful business is not a walk in the park, but it is certainly a realizable and achievable goal. 

It doesn’t always require a lot of money (although that would clearly be an asset) and frankly, it doesn’t even require that you have more talent than the “average Joe.”  However, building a successful business does require a strategic business owner who follows the principles of success to build a castle where there was once only sand.  Let’s talk about the Top 5 Success Principles that will teach you how to create a successful business in realistic and achievable steps. 

You can build a successful business by following these five success principles.  Many business owners tend to make a situation more complicated than it needs to be; they think achieving success is only attainable for the rich and famous or for those who have been dealt a lucky hand.  However, it’s been proven many times over that an “average Joe” can transform into a wealthy business owner if they are dedicated to success and learn how to think strategically for the sake of their business. 

The most important factor when achieving success is having a game plan.  Without it you are merely going to be “winging it,” and that will make the journey more complicated that it needs to be.

            <title>The ‘stuff’ in your head is distracting you!</title>
            <description>The ‘stuff’ in your head is distracting you from achieving your goals!

Do you have things continually going on in your head about all the things you have to do today, tomorrow, next week, etc.?  Those are distractions!  When you effectively use your calendar and master task list or your goals sheet (whichever you want to call it) on a consistent basis you don’t have to have all these things going on in your head thinking you have to remember them and being afraid you are going to forget to do something.  

Do some of these things you have in your head keep you up at night?  When you take them out of your head and put them on your Master Task List or Prioritized Action List and then on your calendar, you can sleep better every night.  

You will be more in control and you will feel a sense of relief. Don’t believe me, try this for yourself and you will be like the many people I coach who have that sigh of relief when they get all these distractions out of their head and in the proper place. 

Stop distracting yourself with all your thoughts.   Implement effective time management and use your master task list to your advantage and stop letting all that ‘stuff’ in your head distracts you from what you are capable of achieving.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">The ‘stuff’ in your head is distracting you from achieving your goals!

Do you have things continually going on in your head about all the things you have to do today, tomorrow, next week, etc.?  Those are distractions!  When you effectively use your calendar and master task list or your goals sheet (whichever you want to call it) on a consistent basis you don’t have to have all these things going on in your head thinking you have to remember them and being afraid you are going to forget to do something.  

Do some of these things you have in your head keep you up at night?  When you take them out of your head and put them on your Master Task List or Prioritized Action List and then on your calendar, you can sleep better every night.  

You will be more in control and you will feel a sense of relief. Don’t believe me, try this for yourself and you will be like the many people I coach who have that sigh of relief when they get all these distractions out of their head and in the proper place. 

Stop distracting yourself with all your thoughts.   Implement effective time management and use your master task list to your advantage and stop letting all that ‘stuff’ in your head distracts you from what you are capable of achieving.

            <title>Use the 80/20 Rule to Grow Your Business</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Use the 80/20 Rule to Grow Your Business.

If your business is not growing, you need to get a handle on the way you’re running it.  Many business owners tend to spend a great amount of time performing unnecessary tasks that contribute little to the growth of your business.  The 80/20 rule, otherwise known as the Pareto Principle, teaches that only 20% of your actions should lead to 80% of your results.  Get a handle on your business by putting the 80/20 rule into effect and identifying high payoff tasks. 

The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle) Explained 

What the Pareto Principle Means for Your Business 

Identify the High Payoff Tasks 

The Other Side of the Pareto Principle 

If your business is struggling, you can use the 80/20 rule to identify high payoff tasks.  If you are currently working ten hours or more each day, put the 80/20 rule into action to finally take back control of your life.  By doing so, you’ll be able to move past the fruitless tasks that make up 80% of your business and take up most of your time.

            <title>Stop Procrastinating and Just Freakin' Do It</title>
            <description>Procrastination, also known as dilly-dallying, dragging your feet, and excuse making is something we have all experienced at one time or another.  

Why do people procrastinate?  

So how to stop procrastinating?

Just FREAKIN’ DO IT!

What is stopping you? What are you really afraid of? 
What’s the worst that can happen if you just do it?

I’ve talked with so many people about just doing what they weren’t doing and they realized that they were really afraid of the unknown and that when they actually did what they were afraid of it wasn’t so bad after all and they actually received positive feedback and the next time they were procrastinating, they just sucked it up, but their big girl or big boy pants on and did it. 

One example that seems to come up often is asking for referrals. Asking people they know. We cop out for some reason and just don’t want to do it.  When they came up with a script and committed to the action, they executed it, and had success in every case. 

Speaking of peace of mind, when you think back to all the times you put something off because you thought it was going to cause you great discomfort – was it really as bad as you thought it would be?  It probably wasn’t, but you worried about it – put it off – worried about it some more – put it off longer…

It doesn’t have to be that way.  Just DO IT!

            <title>How to Produce Big Results</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about How to Produce Big Results.

If you’ve failed at producing big results in your business, it’s time to let the failures go and move on.  As an entrepreneur, you do not have time to sit around with regret; you’ve got to get moving!  

If you want to produce big results, you first need to understand how to get big results.  Big results are brought upon by the confidence to take action - again and again.  When it comes down to it, who’s going to believe in your business when you don’t seem to believe in it yourself?  If you have at any time questioned your ability to create the kind of life you have always wanted, a change in mindset would work wonders for your personal and professional life.  

Learn how to Use the 4-D Master Task List / Prioritized Action List

Learn from other Successful Entrepreneurs 

Learn to Take Risks 

Remember, it is always and only about taking action that puts you on the straightest path to achieving your goals.  The only person responsible for creating that path is you.  You must learn it is only habit that separates you from the most successful entrepreneurs in the world.  They have learned how to optimize their time and results to get there faster.  The straighter the line, the quicker you produce big results.

            <title>Increase The Power of Your Focus and Achieve Your Goals</title>
            <description>Living your life without practicing The Power of Focus, is like trying to hit the bull’s eye of a target you can’t see.  You can spend hours launching arrows, only to miss the target entirely.  You become exhausted and frustrated when your repeated efforts don’t show the results you are trying to achieve.  This is what it feels like to operate without The Power of Focus.

To get to where you want to be, you must hold clear in your mind what you most want.  Your subconscious mind is a powerful, goal-achieving machine, but it can’t lead you to your desired goal, if you don’t provide it with a specific target.  If it doesn’t have a clear and specific target, it can’t get you there.  

The Power of Focus is the practice of focusing on the ‘right’ tasks at hand, while minimizing distractions that take your focus away from your goals.  It will improve time management, professional and personal performance, task efficiency, overall life balance, and provide your mind the information it needs to get you to the bull’s eye.

A client of mine set a goal she was afraid to set because she had never been successful at achieving it before. We brainstormed a list of what we thought were the ‘right’ activities she needed to do in order to achieve this particular goal.  She got focused on these activities, did them, and exceeded her goal!  The same thing can happen for you when you focus on the ‘right’ activities.

If it doesn’t have a clear and specific target, it can’t get you there.  

The Power of Focus is the practice of focusing on the ‘right’ tasks at hand, while minimizing distractions that take your focus away from your goals.  It will improve time management, professional and personal performance, task efficiency, overall life balance, and provide your mind the information it needs to get you to the bull’s eye.

A client of mine set a goal she was afraid to set because she had never been successful at achieving it before. We brainstormed a list of what we thought were the ‘right’ activities she needed to do in order to achieve this particular goal.  She got focused on these activities, did them, and exceeded her goal!  The same thing can happen for you when you focus on the ‘right’ activities.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Living your life without practicing The Power of Focus, is like trying to hit the bull’s eye of a target you can’t see.  You can spend hours launching arrows, only to miss the target entirely.  You become exhausted and frustrated when your repeated efforts don’t show the results you are trying to achieve.  This is what it feels like to operate without The Power of Focus.

            <title>4 Tips to Communicate Effectively with Clients</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Tips to Communicate Effectively with Clients.

While many business owners believe they communicate effectively with clients, the reality is that few professionals know how to communicate effectively with clients to get the desired results.

While there is no secret formula to practicing effective communication with clients, there are some tips to help you convey professionalism, integrity, and confidence.  Just working at consistently enhancing communication is going above and beyond what most do, and therefore, will have a positive outcome.  These four tips will help you become a guru in client communication. 

Being a business owner goes far beyond the books and sales.  You must be a forward-thinking problem solver who is continually evolving into a better business owner and person.  Essentially, you become a leader the moment you start your own business and can never relinquish the title for as long as you own your business.  Throughout the life of your business, it will be a continual refinement of processes and communication; adapting your approach to suit the needs of your clients.

            <title>What is Strategic Thinking &amp; How to Apply it to Your Busines</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about What is Strategic Thinking and How to Apply it to Your Business.

The theory of strategic thinking has been gaining steam in the business world.  While it follows the same outline as strategic planning, it differs in that it allows more flexibility, greater creativity, and more collaboration among multiple levels of management.  

Essentially, strategic thinking is a method outlining the following:
•	Understanding the implications of strategic actions
•	Holding the past, present and future in mind in order to make effective decisions
•	Focusing on the goal of the action with the intent of achieving it
•	Combining critical and creative thinking to all decisions
•	“Intelligent optimism,” the ability to respond to good opportunities

Each of these steps is categorized into the 7 following areas. Let’s discuss them now.

Now let’s talk about five steps to implementing Strategic Thinking in your business.

Strategic Thinking is not a new way of thinking; many successful large organizations have used these practices to establish a clear and precise path on which to carry out their vision.  It is essentially a critical thinking process in which all business details are written down in black and white, so that all team members work cooperatively to drive success in the most direct path with the least resistance.  Applying Strategic Thinking practices to your small business will accelerate your success by allowing a crystal clear focus to drive daily tasks - for you and your team.

            <title>Are your limiting beliefs helping you or hurting you?</title>
            <description>We all have limiting beliefs that we don’t even realize we have.
I was talking with a client one day about referrals.  Referrals in most businesses are very important. It is typically much easier to get a new client when they are being referred to us than if you are just doing regular marketing and there isn’t a referral. 
He was telling me he wanted to get more referrals…
He only always gets 2 referrals every time he asks.
I asked him what he expected to receive and he said 2.  Hummmmmm.
I asked him if he expected to receive more did he think he could get more.  Hmmmmmm
He said YES.
Do he picked a bigger number and started expecting more and guess what… he received more.

Expect to receive referrals from everyone you ask.  Show up like this is what you expect.  People who ask - receive.  I have known people who have received 90 and 175 referrals from one existing ideal client source.  The source can be an existing client, a prospect, a friend, acquaintance, or strategic alliance / center of influence.  A person I know received in excess of 200 referrals from one strategic alliance source.  

Another person received directories of groups where their client was a member, with names of ideal client profile candidates highlighted and pertinent information about each one.  I call these occurrences, the mother load.  It may not happen often but it can happen to you if you believe it can.  It can come to you in big numbers from all different sources.  Expect it to happen and it probably will.

Put yourself in the position to have the highest probability of achieving your goals and make it as easy as possible for people to provide you with what you want.

            <title>4 Benefits of Embracing Change</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Benefits of Embracing Change

You don’t need anyone to tell you that the world is undergoing many changes right now, that’s pretty obvious.  What may not be so obvious is your ability to adapt to the changes that are necessary for your business to survive and thrive in the changing market.  How do you set yourself up for success when global changes are affecting the future of your business?  You find out where the change is headed and adapt to meet the demand.

Embracing change is important for everyone to embrace.  The ability to adapt to change, and even welcome it, is absolutely essential to the success of your business and life.  What happens when you fight change?  That’s pretty simple; instead of embracing change and adapting to it, you spent hours of energy fighting it – only to have to surrender to it in the end.  The fight didn’t make it any easier, nor did it prevent the change from occurring.  So why waste all the time and emotional energy to fight something that is inevitable?

Let’s take a look at 4 things that can happen when you embrace change.

Change can sometimes be scary, but it really is the key to ultimate success both in life and in business.  What are you really afraid of anyway?  It may not always feel comfortable, but the more willing you are to embrace change, the less painful it usually is and the more success you will experience.  There is no single key to overcoming the anxiety you may feel when embracing change.  The important thing to remember is that there are very exciting results waiting for you on the other side, you just need to embrace change with a welcome mat.

            <itunes:summary>Today we are going to talk about 4 Benefits of Embracing Change

You don’t need anyone to tell you that the world is undergoing many changes right now, that’s pretty obvious.  What may not be so obvious is your ability to adapt to the changes that are necessary for your business to survive and thrive in the changing market.  How do you set yourself up for success when global changes are affecting the future of your business?  You find out where the change is headed and adapt to meet the demand.

Embracing change is important for everyone to embrace.  The ability to adapt to change, and even welcome it, is absolutely essential to the success of your business and life.  What happens when you fight change?  That’s pretty simple; instead of embracing change and adapting to it, you spent hours of energy fighting it – only to have to surrender to it in the end.  The fight didn’t make it any easier, nor did it prevent the change from occurring.  So why waste all the time and emotional energy to fight something that is inevitable?

Let’s take a look at 4 things that can happen when you embrace change.

Change can sometimes be scary, but it really is the key to ultimate success both in life and in business.  What are you really afraid of anyway?  It may not always feel comfortable, but the more willing you are to embrace change, the less painful it usually is and the more success you will experience.  There is no single key to overcoming the anxiety you may feel when embracing change.  The important thing to remember is that there are very exciting results waiting for you on the other side, you just need to embrace change with a welcome mat.  In the words of one of my clients, “Put your big girl/boy pants on, and suck it up and deal with it.”

            <title>Leverage Time and Calendar Management to Get the BEST RESULT</title>
            <description>We all have 168 hours in the week and it’s all about how effectively we use the time we have. 

Here are a few things to ponder:

Calendar Activities to Get the BEST RESULT 
When is the best time to do the various activities you have to get the best results?
So many people say to themselves that this is the best time for me….. Well, is it the best time to produce the best results?  That is what you are looking for. You may like to do a certain activity at some time but that may not produce the best result.  You may have to go through trial and error initially but it will pay off big when you are doing your high pay-off activities at the right time to produce the BEST RESULT.  You can learn this by tracking what you do and when you do it. 

Calendaring may take some getting used to, but it really does make your life simpler by maximizing time and performance.  You will feel in control of your life and enjoy it even more.  With improved efficiency and great time management you will get more done in a shorter amount of time - all with less stress.

            <title>5 Tips for Mastering your Beliefs</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Are you Headed for Success or Disaster?  5 Tips for Mastering your Beliefs

If there is one thing that holds the most power over your success, you can bet that it comes down to your beliefs.  Before you even have the opportunity to consciously process the reason behind your actions, and the results those actions put in play, your beliefs are at work determining whether you are headed toward success or disaster.

There are literally tens of thousands of actions you take daily (some consciously, most unconsciously), but do you know how those actions are affecting your success?  You can probably think of at least one action that you have taken in the past that didn’t necessarily deliver the results you desired.  With conscious awareness, you have the ability to examine and identify what went wrong, and what you could change to bring about a different result next time.  This is an example of conscious awareness.  

But what about all those times you make unconscious decisions that bring about undesired results.  How do you stop them from occurring?  Here is your opportunity to learn how to master your beliefs and head for success.

When you expand your belief system, you expand your success.  In addition, when you learn to make decisions based on your awareness of wealth and success, your beliefs will shape your success in the way you want it.

            <title>Leverage resources and tools to help you achieve your goals</title>
            <description>Many people are leveraging social media to help them obtain referrals and increase their business.  I’ve talked to many people utilizing these resources to do more business. If you like the idea, you may want to include this into your business to see how it can help you do more business and make more money.  

Here’s an example:  
An Advisor who is on LinkedIn, found out that a client of his with whom he was having an upcoming meeting with was also on LinkedIn.  He noticed that this client had a LinkedIn community of approximately 30 or so people. The client came in to meet with the Advisor for their regular meeting.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Advisor was prepared to ask for referrals to see who else they knew who he might be able to help.  He showed the client the LinkedIn community list he took off the internet and asked him who on the list of 30 people in his community would be appropriate to refer to him.  

To net it out, he got about 9 referrals from the list of 30 names from this one idea. 

There are many other social media websites (ex. Plaxo, Facebook, Youtube, Ecademy, Twitter, etc) that you can utilize to take advantage of this simple strategy to obtain even more referrals and get more clients so you can help them if they need your product or service. We always want to make it as easy as possible to help people refer people to us who may need our products or services.  

You can leverage this powerful resource to your advantage and increase the number of referrals and overall business you receive so you can grow your business even faster. You can leverage this resource to do research that can help put you in a higher probability position to achieve your goals.

            <title>6 Tips for Gaining Confidence</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 6 Tips for Gaining Confidence

Becoming an entrepreneur can be one of the most unnerving ventures in your entire life.  Just when you thought you knew it all, you find out you’re just a student trying to make the grade.  So what do you do when your confidence takes a hit?  We discuss 6 tips for helping you gain confidence.

Continue to accomplish little successes along the way and know that your confidence grows with each step forward.  It may help you to keep a log of what works and doesn’t work, so you can go back and review it before taking future steps.  If something didn’t work, tweak it with a set of creative eyes and try it again.  Eventually the pieces will fall into place and you’ll become better at succeeding on the first attempt.  Before you know it, you’ll be beaming confidence and that will come across in everything you do – especially your business.

            <title>Easily and Quickly Attract Ideal Clients to Achieve Goals</title>
            <description>I believe it takes the same amount of energy to obtain an ideal client as it does anyone who is breathing and not ideal. If you are going to invest time and marketing money into getting clients, why not get the kind of clients you want. You will probably need fewer of them anyway then if you just look for ‘clients’ (anyone to fill a slot). 

Before you talk to your existing clients and strategic alliances about referrals, you need to create an Ideal Client Profile. This description should be detailed and specific. Take advantage of the FREE online exercise to help you create your Ideal Client Profile at http://www.accountabilitycoach.com/.  

Think about who your best clients are right now, and consider what makes them so great. What attitudes and attributes do they have that you enjoy them so much?

The clearer you are on what you want you will begin to attract them to you.  You will be better at asking for what you want.  You can join groups where you know these people are instead of just accepting anyone and needing even more clients to achieve your goals. 

Not make a list of your clients, peers, friends, and strategic alliances/centers of influence and potential strategic alliances/centers of influence (think outside the box) who you think have clients who fit your profile or they would know people who would fit your profile.

Figure out exactly what you want, state it clearly, and allow the people you know to help you find them and attract them to you. Reap the rewards!

            <title>Is Lack of Motivation Stopping You From Getting Things Done?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about, Is Lack of Motivation Stopping You From Getting Things Done?

If you’re sitting at your desk with a “To Do List” a mile long, but you can’t find the motivation to tackle it, keep reading.  By the end of this article, you will hopefully reclaim your motivation and enthusiasm.

How is it that some days it feels as if you have enough motivation to conquer the world, yet other days, the smallest task seems to drain the life out of you?  The answer is simple: motivation is fueled by your level of desire and commitment, and when your desire and commitment falls, so does your motivation.

Have you ever been so engrossed by something you loved every second of it and lost track of all time?  Your desire and commitment was so high, that time became non-existent, when in reality, several hours had passed.

So how do you deal with lack of motivation for tasks that you dislike, yet must be done?

The good news is that your lack of motivation can be resolved with only a shift in thinking.  We will talk about three specific tips and action steps for helping you.

Regardless of the money invested or personal passion for the business, if you don’t hold yourself accountable for the success of your business, there’s only a slim chance you will ever reach the level of success you have in mind. 

While there are several components to building a successful business, many entrepreneurs fail to realize that accountability is the driving force behind success or failure.  It is essentially a “no-excuses” approach to everything business.  Ask any successful business owner and they’ll confirm the only reason things happened was because they understand they were the only person who could make or break the business.

How does accountability make a positive impact on the success of your business?  We will talk about the top 4 distinguishing factors of business owners who use accountability to get results.

It’s up to you to take the actions required to achieve your goals.  Successful business owners are disciplined for a reason - it’s because their diligence produces results.  You must consistently become your own motivator and cheerleader, although it can be challenging at times to be so.

The truth is for most, when left to our own devices we let too many distractions keep us from the activities we know we need to do and yet don’t do them for whatever it is that’s stopping us.  These groups (or coaching) will provide you with support when you need to push through fear or doubt and take action to get the results you desire.

            <description>Today we are going to talk about 5 Tips for Creating Balance in Your Life.

Is your life truly in balance?  Don’t be so quick to answer yes.  Leading a balanced life doesn’t mean living 50/50 between your personal and business lives.  It’s about having enough time to do what really matters to you, whether that’s turning a nice profit in business or spending quality time with your family. 

If you feel as if you life is completely out of alignment, we will discuss 5 tips for creating balance in your life. 

Creating balance in life won’t happen overnight; it may take weeks or months.  The important thing is to be sure your goals are really what you want.  It doesn’t matter what someone else wants for you - it only matters what you truly want.  Always start from within and work outward - not the other way around.  

To help you get started, complete your personal Wheel of Life and Quality of Life Enhancer ™ exercise you will find on my website (www.AccountabilityCoach.com).  These resources are complimentary.  Get an actual reality check on your current situation and then create a game plan for where you want to be and by when.  Balance in your life will bring even more happiness to you.  Start today.

            <title>Eliminate Distractions and Increase Success</title>
            <description>We're all guilty of allowing the little things to distract us from what we should be doing.  Instead of working, we chat with our friends or co-workers, check the latest chain email in our inbox, surf the internet, and do everything we can to avoid working on the things the produce the best results.  In order to get where you want to be, you have to do the work required to achieve your goals and experience ultimate success.

Take a moment and ask yourself where you truly want to be?  Now tell me how many things you did today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday that directly contributed to the future results you want.  And then tell me how many things you did today that did not contribute to your success.  Those things probably distracted you from what you knew you should have been doing.

Distractions are called distractions for a reason.  They are distracting you from doing what you need to do in order to get you where you ultimately want to be.

Reduce and eliminate distractions so you are in a better position to achieve your goals.

            <title>Do You Know Where Your Focus Is Taking You?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Do You Know Where Your Focus Is Taking You?

As an entrepreneur, you know the importance of focus and how it directly affects your success, for better or worse.  This is most evident when applied to your goals; the more focused you are, the more precise your actions can be, getting you closer to your goals - faster.  But did you know there are different levels of focus?  The level which you are focused on will determine where you’re going.  So the question is - do you know where your focus is taking you?

We’re going to explore the different levels of focus.

Before you apply this information to your life, take some time to write down your goals.  Start with your life focus and then work backwards, including each level of focus until you reach the daily focus.  You want to start with your life focus so you can start with the big picture.

            <itunes:summary>Today we are going to talk about Do You Know Where Your Focus Is Taking You?

As an entrepreneur, you know the importance of focus and how it directly affects your success, for better or worse.  This is most evident when applied to your goals; the more focused you are, the more precise your actions can be, getting you closer to your goals - faster.  But did you know there are different levels of focus?  The level which you are focused on will determine where you’re going.  So the question is - do you know where your focus is taking you?

We’re going to explore the different levels of focus.

Before you apply this information to your life, take some time to write down your goals.  Start with your life focus and then work backwards, including each level of focus until you reach the daily focus.  You want to start with your life focus so you can start with the big picture.  From there, you can break down your focus into yearly, monthly and then daily goals.  Each night before you go to bed, write down your daily focus for the following day.  You may want to buy a small notebook or keep a lined tablet in your daily planner, so you always have it on you, even if you’re on the road.

            <title>Create Systems and Processes for Maximum Effectiveness</title>
            <description>So many small companies and even large ones fail to create systems and processes for every job and this is a costly mistake, in my opinion. 

It does take time up front but saves a lot of time in the long run.  If you have team members who are on vacation, get sick, or quit or get terminated, you have to start all over with training a new person. If there are procedures manuals with all the systems and processes for that job, you spend little to no time training the new person.  This alone will save you an enormous amount of time, and a lot of aggravation.

The procedures manual should have everything documented so that if a monkey can read and type, a monkey could do the job without knowing anything about the industry or the job. It should be very specific so that nobody has to ask any questions and can perform the job as you would like it done.

Many organizations don’t invest the time and energy in to creating these and pay time and time again for not doing it.  

My advice is to have everyone in your organization, create a certain number of processes for their job each week (say 1-2) until everything is documented.

            <title>Real Life Isn’t Boring! How to Live Life with No Regrets</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Real Life Isn’t Boring! How to Live Life with No Regrets.

Life goes by so quickly – don’t miss out on the extraordinary opportunities you have to live life without regret!  Ask yourself this question, if you left this world tomorrow, would you feel as if you lived life to the fullest extent?

While you can’t turn back the clock and change past events, would you – if you had the power – change the way things are now?  

Then let me ask you, what is real life supposed to be about?

I challenge you to break that false perception and create a new rule of your own.

If you could live life exactly as you wanted, what would you change?  If you could change three things in your life – right now – what would they be?  

Do not waste one more day of your precious life.  Take stock of the life you live now and the life you would like to live, and start moving in that direction.  

Utilize the Quality of Life Enhancer™ online free exercise to help you create your list.  You can find this online tool at www.AccountabilityCoach.com (under the complimentary silver membership section).  Share it with your family and others who you think will benefit from this exercise.  Create the kind of life you truly want and one with no or fewer regrets.

            <title>Being Client Centered - It's All About Them</title>
            <description>How to Make Your Business Truly All-About-Them – Client Centered

When asked, most people will tell you that they think there are client-centered and their business is really about their clients.

I work with so many entrepreneurs who say they are client-centered and they believe they communicate in an it’s all about them fashion.  We all feel this way but are we actually communicating this way?

Here are a few tips to help enhance your communication so it is really all about them.

The language used in marketing materials, including the website, is just as important as personal conversations and emails.  Review all marketing materials to see where all-about-them language can be substituted to take your business to the next level.

            <title>Stop Procrastinating in 4 Easy Steps</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about how to Stop Procrastinating in 4 Easy Steps.

Procrastination, also known as dilly-dallying, dragging your feet, and excuse making is something we have all experienced at one time or another.  The learned bad habits of our teens and early adult life (all those times we put off doing our homework and college term papers) can continue to haunt us well into our professional years.

Actually, there is no such thing as healthy procrastination.  To understand, let’s get to the root of the issue.

We talk about why people procrastinate to begin with.

So how do we stop procrastinating?

            <itunes:summary>Today we are going to talk about how to Stop Procrastinating in 4 Easy Steps.

Procrastination, also known as dilly-dallying, dragging your feet, and excuse making is something we have all experienced at one time or another.  The learned bad habits of our teens and early adult life (all those times we put off doing our homework and college term papers) can continue to haunt us well into our professional years.

Actually, there is no such thing as healthy procrastination.  To understand, let’s get to the root of the issue.

We talk about why people procrastinate to begin with.

So how do we stop procrastinating?

            <title>Are You Committed To Your Success?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Are You Committed To Your Success?

Sure, many entrepreneurs say they are committed to their success, but are they really?

When it comes to commitment to your success, there has to be a “no excuses - no exception” rule to back it up.  This rule is especially true for entrepreneurs, simply because there is no one to point the finger at should things not work out as planned.  As an entrepreneur, you are the one holding the key to your success and no one, but you, can be held accountable.

Once you make a commitment to something, there absolutely has to be a “no excuses - no exception” rule, because that is the only rule that separates the failures from the successes.  
Imagine what would happen if you were to commit to your success only 99% of the time:

See how much of a difference there is between 99% and 100% commitment?  Although 1% doesn’t sound like much, reaching 100% commitment at every opportunity is not always easy.  The only way to truly hold a reputation for commitment is by consistently demonstrating 100% to each and every task.  Once genuine commitment is displayed, your success is inevitable.

There are two rules when it comes to your success, and a sure-fire way to catapult your success, but they only work when you are 100% committed! We discuss these two rules.

You must embrace commitment to your goals along with never ending improvement if you wish to reach true success.

            <title>6 Management Strategies for Organizational Change Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 6 Management Strategies for Organizational Change Success.

Human beings tend to resist anything they view as stressful, and let’s face it, organizational changes are about as stressful as it can get!

For most of us, familiarity with our surroundings, our relationships and our working environment allows us to reside safely inside our comfort zone. And comfort equals security.

But when our comfort zone is detonated by changes in management or organizational systems, we implode, seeking the shelter of our innate desire to resist, at all costs.

Changes that occur outside of our control force us to adapt to new rules, new systems and new policies which can, at the outset, make us feel uncomfortable and insecure.

We discuss the 6 Management Strategies to Avert Resistance.

Organizational changes within a business often prove to be a suitable testing ground for leadership qualities; from the employees all the way through to top level management.  

Those who possess the qualities that define a good leader often emerge during the stressful environment that usually accompanies change. This creates an ideal opportunity for potential leaders to display those qualities and be recognized accordingly.  

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

            <title>10 Tactics for Making the Right Business Decisions</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 10 Tactics for Making the Right Business Decisions.

Leadership is not a popularity contest. In business as in life, it’s not always the good ‘guy’ who wins, it’s the ‘guy’ who makes the good decisions.

Business leaders are forced to make choices every day. Some of those decisions will prove to be highly successful and innovative; some will dissipate into thin air; some may cause dissention in the ranks, while others may have staff believing they have a chimpanzee in the CEO’s office.

In the current dynamic and rapidly evolving business world, decisions often have to be made rapidly and without the benefit of a strategic agenda for managing change.

What we discuss applies to every form of business, from small and mid-size companies to large corporations.

In most cases, the decision makers don’t have the luxury of a “wait and see” policy. In that time, multi-million dollar opportunities have been and gone.

A survey of corporate executives by a faculty of the Harvard Business School found that an enormous shift has occurred in the policy making decisions of those responsible for signing off on the expansion and profit potential of corporate America.

The research findings suggested that 10 points are necessary to provide the required maneuverability and flexibility required to keep pace in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

We will discuss the 10 skills that are required for helping to make the right business decisions. 
Based on the information in this podcast, ask yourself: How will you apply, improve, or change your business tactics in order to put yourself in the highest probability position to achieve your goals?  Update your game plan and implement these new decisions for increased success.

A survey of corporate executives by a faculty of the Harvard Business School found that an enormous shift has occurred in the policy making decisions of those responsible for signing off on the expansion and profit potential of corporate America.

The research findings suggested that 10 points are necessary to provide the required maneuverability and flexibility required to keep pace in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

We will discuss the 10 skills that are required for helping to make the right business decisions.

            <title>Choose Wisely: Choose Life</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Choose Wisely: Choose Life.

The choices you make every minute of every day influence the life you live and the person you are. Make them wisely.

I can choose to eat the bowl of ice cream, knowing I’ll have to spend an extra 30 minutes or more on the treadmill tomorrow, or I can choose to forego the ice cream and feel sorry for myself for at least the next hour or so.

Heck! I choose to eat the ice cream anyway, knowing that I may as well have rubbed the entire bowl straight on my belly, but also accepting the fact that the price I will pay for 2 minutes of glorious ice cream today is 30 minutes or more of hard push on the treadmill tomorrow.

Nevertheless, I made the choice and I take full responsibility for making a choice that may not have necessarily been the right one.

That’s what making choices is all about – taking full responsibility for our actions.

As Ann Weber, a psychologist from North Carolina says, “Choice is uncomfortable, because it makes us feel responsible. The advantage of indecision is being blameless, but the disadvantage is a life out of control.” 

We talk about 4 personality types who avoid decision making. Do you fall into one of these categories?

Consider this: life doesn’t just happen. The life we choose to lead is dictated by the choices we’ve made in the past, those we make today and those we’ll make in the future.

            <title>7 Ideas to Engage and Motivate Your Staff</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 7 Ideas to Engage and Motivate Your Staff.

Luckily, the success of your organization isn’t dependent on the singular input of employees like Sarah, but what needs to happen to generate a positive and motivational environment for all your employees, Sarah included?

As a business leader, the most important lesson you can learn about motivating staff is that what motivates you may not necessarily motivate Sarah or any of the other employees you are responsible for.

Motivation means different things to different people. As a business manager, it is an integral part of your role to observe and learn what inspires and motivates each and every member of your staff.

Next we are going to discuss 7 ideas on how to engage and motivate your staff

Add any of these ideas into your business to help increase the motivation of your staff so you can experience even better results from them. They will appreciate you thinking enough of them and their abilities to implement these in your organization.

            <title>How Strong Is Your Belief?</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about How Strong Is Your Belief?

What you believe about the world at large and how you fit into the general scheme of things will determine who you are and how you relate to the world you live in.

What we believe about ourselves is encapsulated in the voice we hear in our head. And what that voice tells us is so powerful it will manifest itself in every action we take, every word we say, and every thought we think.

We are who we believe ourselves to be.

Nobody else but you has access to the turntable of your mind. And only you have the power to change the recording.

We talk about 10 guidelines to change that old record on the player that goes around in your head, and replace it with a melody you can play for the rest of your life.

To believe is to give meaning to your life. To believe in yourself harnesses all your strengths, unlocks your potential and creates a world of endless possibilities.

We are going to discuss 5 Strategies to help you with Personal Change.

Don’t waste time and energy fighting the inevitable. Learn to see change as a new adventure on the road through life and embrace the future!

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

Our beliefs about ourselves, those around us and the world at large affect who we are and how we behave. Beliefs are merely thoughts that with a little encouragement and repetition from our over-active minds transform into facts. Or so we are led to believe. 

Once we have formed a self-limiting belief, we continue to pursue evidence to prove that our belief is real. These beliefs are backed up by our self-talk, providing further evidence to back up our negative thoughts.

So, how do we break the vicious cycle of self-limiting beliefs and create more positive outcomes?

We discuss a 6 Step Plan to Break the Cycle of Limiting Beliefs

Breaking a self-limiting belief is like seeing the world for the first time without the lens cap on. A brave new world of opportunity that you never knew existed is out there, waiting just for you.

            <title>Make More Money and Stop Wasting Time</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about how Wasted Time Adds Up – How you can make more money by focusing on your high pay-off activities (or have more time to do what you want)?

How much time do you think you waste each day?   Really think about this for a minute – how much time do you think you waste each day?  Remember it all adds up.  Five minutes here, 10 minutes, there 30 minutes on something fun yet not productive.  

When we asked people how much time do they think they waste in a day, many of them said approx. 2 hours per day.  So we will use this as our example. You can easily do the math for yourself depending on the number you came up with for how much time you think you waste each day.  

Here’s an example of someone who said they ‘waste’ 2 hours per day.

2 hours per day
= 10 hours per week
= 1 week per month
= 12 weeks per year
Divide by 4 and you get a whopping 3 months per year that is spent in non-productive time.  

Now, let’s not dwell on the non-productive time that we waste.  Let’s see what that time is worth to us in revenue per year if we utilize that 2 hours per day on high pay-off activities.  

Even if you start by being more effective and not letting time-wasters and distractions get in your way for 30 minutes per day, you will make even more money and have the option to take more time to do what you want to do.  How can you apply this concept in your life so you can achieve more of your goals?

            <title>The 4 Factors for Effective Commitment</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about What Are You Committed To? The 4 Factors for Effective Commitment.

Commitment means being bound by a course of action to bring about the desired results. It is one of the most powerful personal traits we can aim to achieve.

Being committed to yourself, your goals, your business and your relationships is what raises you above the mediocre, because people who honor their commitments stand out in the crowd.

Not honoring your commitment destroys your credibility, dependability, and trustworthiness. Enjoy the discussion on the four factors for effective commitment.

What it takes is a shared desire to achieve the same vision and determination to succeed no matter what obstacles are placed in your path.

What will you do next to increase your commitments?  Make a list and begin implementing them in your life.

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

A healthy dose of self confidence increases your opportunities for success, improves your relationships on a business level as well as a personal level and makes you a better person to be around.

Like many aspects of life, we choose whether we want to live a fulfilling, confident, and happy existence or live in perpetual fear of failure, clinging on to what little self esteem we possess.

If you feel you could do with a shot of self confidence, here are 20 powerful tips to boost your confidence.

As you listen to this podcast, think about which one of these 20 tips will you add into your life to boost your confidence?  Make a list and begin adding them one a time. 

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

            <title>The Art of Effective Delegation and Getting More Done</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about the Art of Effective Delegation as it relates to getting more things done.

Learning the delicate art of delegation usually requires a lot practice and patience.  It's a fine dance of constant refinement and adjustment to find the perfect balance of effective delegation that allows you to take your business to the next level.  

Any successful business relies on a team structure for growth and efficiency. While one person may be able to do a lot, it’s not possible for one person to do everything, and at some point, a team structure is a necessity. 

As you’ve learned, people who work with me learn to focus their time on only the highest pay-off activities in order to help them reach their goals faster. So what do these people do to accomplish these less important tasks? They delegate.

Think about your daily routine for a moment. How would your life be improved if someone else handled these “low-pay off tasks,” freeing up your time to take on more important matters?

In an effort to maximize your time, you want to stay focused on only doing your highest pay-off activities, so you might have to delegate, delay, or drop other things in order to have highest probability of achieving your goals.

The goal is for you to spend your time with the greatest efficiency. If you are not happy with the amount of time you are spending each day on your activities, reorganize, delegate, and change your calendar around until your time is spent achieving your professional and personal goals.

Walt Disney says:  “If you can dream it, you can do it.”

            <title>The Power of Confidence, Belief, and Calendaring</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Confidence, Belief, and Effective Calendaring / Time Management.

Focus on activities within your control. While you cannot control other people, communication is key for establishing effective accountability measurements to help ensure things are completed on schedule.  

So what can you control?  
YOU!  

Wake up each day with extra Confidence because people need to take some of your confidence to help them get through whatever they are going through. You have to come across with confidence because you believe in what you do and how you can make a difference in people’s lives. 

So what do you need to do every night to wake up each day with extra confidence to help clients and prospects? What do you have to do each day to gladly give some of your extra confidence away to help others have more confidence in your and what you can do to help them?

Focus on what you can control and do those things that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your goals for the reasons that are important to you.  Stop letting things outside of your control affect you.  

One of the success principles of any successful person is effectively calendaring and time management.  The important part of calendaring is first to put all of the ‘right’ activities on the calendar and then HONOR the calendar. For some, this is the hardest part to do. They let too many distractions or other things get in their way of honoring their calendar.  

Always put yourself in the highest probability position to achieve your goals.  Each activity has a desired result or outcome.  You want to always ask yourself, what has to happen to help ensure, the best possibility, that you achieve your desired outcome.  Prepare to achieve your goal. 

Focus on the results you want today, next week, next month, this year, and with every conversation and activity you do.  Make sure to do whatever you need to do to wake up each day with extra confidence to give away.  Believe in yourself and what you do and others will want to do business with you.  Focus on what you can control and do those things and you will be successful – personally and professionally. Create your reality!  You can do it!

To help keep you focused on the activities that produce the results you want, subscribe to The Accountability Coach Blog at www.AccountabilityCoachBlog.com.   Invest in the 30-day Goal Achievement self-study program so you can begin achieving your goals in the time frame you want so you can have the life you want.

            <description>Our special guest today is Willie Jolley. Willie has been called the most powerful speaker, singer and author combinations in the world today!  He speaks to major companies and organizations around the world… and has developed a reputation for results!  And you know my motto is Excuses Don’t Count and Results do Rule!

He’s authored two international best-selling books: “It Only Takes a Minute To Change Your Life!” and “A Setback Is A Setup For A Comeback.”  And his newest book, “An Attitude of Excellence” is creating a great buzz!    

Because Willie Jolley’s goal is to help you grow and exceed your goals I thought he would be a great person to interview today.

Are you ready for the Willie Jolley Experience! 

Anne: Willie, let’s start off our time today by talking about Attitude. How does one create an Attitude of Excellence, if we currently don’t have one?

Anne: Willie, you wrote a book called “It Only Takes A Minute To Change Your Life!”  
You’ve heard many people say it takes 21 days to change a habit.  I believe we can change a habit in a second.  Just choose to change it and you can change it.

Anne: I’d like to get your perspective on this Willie.  How does a person go about taking a minute to change their life, assuming they know they need to make some changes in order to get from where they are now to where they want to be in life?

Anne: As you heard, I’m a believer in having a balanced life.  How do you suggest people listening to this call today have an even more balanced life so they can grow and exceed their goals?

            <title>11 Guidelines for Increasing the Power of Focus</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 11 Guidelines for Increasing the Power of Focus. 

If asked, what is the one defining quality that sets great leaders apart from their wannabe counterparts, it would have to be their ability to maintain focus on the important issues.

For the majority of us, the power to focus on one task at a time and see it through to completion is not an innate gift. Focus is a learned response, so if we want to achieve the professional, personal and social goals we imagine, we have to first learn how to focus on what we want.

We now live in a frenetic, activity-filled, multi-tasking, instant gratification society, so it is easy to get lost in the distractions that bombard us from every angle. How many times have you found yourself on the phone talking to a client, while reading your emails, hitting the “Reply” button and then typing out a response? Where is your focus while you are completing a number of individual tasks at the same time?

Focus requires that we learn to differentiate between the “urgent” and the “important” tasks. 
The power of focus lies in your ability to distinguish the urgent from the important; and concentrate your energy on the important.

We discuss 11 guidelines to help re-direct your focus and prioritize getting the important things done first.

Staying focused requires effort and determination, but like any project we want to achieve, perfect practice makes perfect!

            <title>4 Proven Methods to Pump Up Productivity</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Proven Methods to Pump Up Productivity

Ask the management team at any organization, large or small, to list their top 5 business priorities and you’ll undoubtedly find “improve productivity” on that list.

The nature of doing business today is focused on finding the competitive edge; therefore, the companies with the highest levels of productivity are going to be the clear winners.

Measuring business productivity differs from one company to the next, but measuring personal productivity is more clearly defined.  So we are going to focus on the management skills necessary to build a more productive workforce.

As dynamic enterprises move towards more autonomous decision making processes to keep pace with rapidly expanding marketplaces, the flow-through effect encompasses increased productivity, a more creative and inventive workforce as well as improvements in the timely delivery of new technologies, products and services.

            <description>Today we are going to talk about 5 Strategies for Personal Change.

Change is inevitable. In fact, change can occur so frequently and regularly that in many cases we hardly notice it.

We change our hairstyles, our fashions, our relationships, our opinion, or we re-arrange the furniture; all with little or no resistance.

So why do some of us react like a nuclear war is pending when we are confronted with change?

So what coping mechanisms can we put in place to ensure we embrace change with a positive attitude and a sense of excitement in the possibilities?

We will discuss 5 Strategies for Personal Change.

Don’t waste time and energy fighting the inevitable. Learn to see change as a new adventure on the road through life and embrace the future!

            <title>11 Positive Ways to Maintain Self Motivation</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 11 Positive Ways to Maintain Self Motivation

Like so many of our character traits, motivation isn’t awarded to us as a birth rate. Instead, motivation is a positive, stimulating power source we plug into with our actions and our way of thinking.

Self motivation cannot exist without purpose and often we find it difficult to locate and create the stimulus and passion that drives us to become motivated, alive and ripe with anticipation.

So what can we do to increase our motivation and find the passion that drives us upward and onward?

We are going to talk about 11 powerful solutions to help you become more self motivated.

Implement these concepts into your life to help you increase and maintain your motivation.

            <title>7 Ideas to Engage and Motivate Your Staff</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 7 Ideas to Engage and Motivate Your Staff / Team Members

As a business leader or small business owner, the most important lesson you can learn about motivating staff is that what motivates you may not necessarily motivate any of the other employees you are responsible for.  Motivation means different things to different people. As a business manager or small business owner, it is an integral part of your role to observe and learn what inspires and motivates each and every member of your staff.

However, having said that, recent psychoanalytical studies on what influences employees to become engaged and proactive yielded a defined methodology that proved to be universally effective.

            <title>You are Distracting You, Discipline, 4 D Formula</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about you distracting you, discipline, and applying the 4 D Formula for helping you focus on your high payoff activities that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your goals.

The ‘stuff’ in your head is distracting you!
Do you have things continually going on in your head of all you have to do today, tomorrow, next week, etc?  Those are distractions!  When you effectively use your calendar and master task list on a consistent basis you don’t have to have all these things going on in your head thinking you have to remember them and being afraid you are going to forget to do something.  

Do some of these things you have in your head keep you up at night?  When you take them out of your head and put them on your master task list and on your calendar, you can sleep better every night.  

You will be more in control and you will feel a sense of relief. Don’t believe me, try this for yourself and you will be like the many people I coach who have that sigh of relief when they get all these distractions out of their head and in the proper place (that you review and honor – did I forget to mention this part…). 

Stop distracting yourself with all your thoughts.  Do it today.  Let me know how I can help you.  

One of the best lessons I ever learned to reduce low pay off activities and leave time for the HPAs is the four D formula for assessing the things in your life. You have too many things to do and not enough time so how do you decide.

Consider ever action item in your life and apply the 4 D formula. 

Apply discipline to effectively using your calendar to take the things going around in your head that are distracting.

            <title>Apply Belief, Confidence &amp; Focus for Even Greater Success</title>
            <description>I believe there are 3 important areas that will help support you in growing your business and achieving your next level of success.  Belief, Confidence, Focus

Changing your circumstances and creating the life you really want starts with creating a high level of belief that allows you to feel that you can achieve anything you set your mind upon.  With conviction and desire, you will be unstoppable because you will believe that anything is possible.  As a result, you will create the life you have always dreamed about having.

The reality is this, whatever you believe is what you have created and will create in your life. A healthy belief system gives you the confidence to achieve any goal you set for yourself, while a weak belief system creates habits that sabotage your ability to achieve your goals. 

The other area that will help support you in being successful is Confidence – 
I believe we all need to wake up every day with extra confidence to give away to those who need some confidence because they don’t have any or don’t have much to get them though the day.  What do you have to do to make sure you wake up every day with extra confidence and still have some left over for you by the end of the day? 

The ability to really Focus on what you can control and do those things that put you in the highest probability position to achieve your goals for the reasons that are important to you is another key area in being successful.  Stop letting things outside of your control negatively affect you.  

What can you control?  Your activities and your emotions.  We just talked about 2 emotions you can control – your BELIEF and your CONFIDENCE.   

Work on increasing your focus on your Highest Payoff Activities will put you in the highest probability position to achieve your goals.  Stop complaining or blaming others for things that you can’t control anyway.  Focus on you and what you can control and you will be even more successful and much happier.

            <title>4 Steps to Creating Successful Results with High Self-esteem</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Steps to Creating Successful Results with High Self-esteem.

Having high self-esteem will give you the edge you need to apply confidence to every situation that demands it.  Self-esteem is the combination of trust and belief in your talents and the ability to successfully complete the task at hand.  It all starts with a clear identification of your talents, complemented by your understanding of their value.  When you can acknowledge the value in your talents, you can acknowledge the value in yourself and that builds your self-esteem.

The bottom line is that high self-esteem contributes to successful action because when action is supported by confidence, you encourage the likelihood for positive results.  Approach any situation with low self-esteem and you could be setting yourself up for failure.  The first step in creating high self-esteem is first understanding the value you bring to every situation.  If you're missing an understanding of who you really are, it's difficult to effectively apply yourself in the situations that come your way.

Through a series of four steps, you will learn how to grasp an understanding of your strengths and talents and how they contribute value to all situations.  Lastly, you will understand how to build trust in your ability to deliver future successful results. We will discuss each of the 4 steps more in detail. They are:
1.	Identify your strengths and talents
2.	Identify your accomplishments
3.	Create new accomplishments you can be proud of
4.	How to trust yourself to be successful in every situation

When you apply your high self-esteem to your business, you have the competitive edge.  With high self-esteem, you'll know you're the right person for the job because you will have a keen understanding of your talents and the value you bring to the situation.  Complement that with the confidence in your ability to deliver what the situation calls for and you have the winning combination.  That winning combination will give you the confidence to present yourself effectively to the client and obtain business or get the job.  When you can convey your high self-esteem to people, they will want to do business with you and look forward to it – plain and simple. You Rule!

            <title>4 Commitments That Can Impact Your Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Commitments That Can Impact Your Success.

Have you ever made a commitment to yourself or someone and for whatever reason, didn’t follow through?  How did you feel? 

We are going to talk about what commitment means to you along with 4 Commitments to remember.  When you analyze these 4 commitments you will notice that they are not that “secretive” at all, rather, disciplines based upon common sense.  

We will also discuss how hard it is to stay committed and what to do about it.

It’s not always easy to stay committed to your purpose, especially in troublesome times.  Successful individuals will eventually achieve their reputation because their commitment was true: they approach their plans with determination and persistence.    

Commitment is most important when times get tough.  Before embarking upon a new journey, plan your future well and prepare for the worst, while always hoping for the best.  Welcome adversity because these are your challenges to overcome.  These are the obstacles that hold you back from achieving your dream.  These are tests for you to pass to show the world just how committed you are to making a difference for yourself and for others.  

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.  To help keep you focused on the activities that produce the results you want, subscribe to The Accountability Coach Blog at www.AccountabilityCoachBlog.com.   Invest in the 30-day Self-study Course so you can begin achieving your goals in the time frame you want so you can have the life you want. This program is effective &amp; powerful at improving every area in your life in 30 days' time. 

Aim for what you want each and every day!  Thanks for listening.</description>

            <media:title xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/">4 Commitments That Can Impact Your Success</media:title>
            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Today we are going to talk about 4 Commitments That Can Impact Your Success.

Have you ever made a commitment to yourself or someone and for whatever reason, didn’t follow through?  How did you feel? 

We are going to talk about what commitment means to you along with 4 Commitments to remember.  When you analyze these 4 commitments you will notice that they are not that “secretive” at all, rather, disciplines based upon common sense.  

We will also discuss how hard it is to stay committed and what to do about it.

It’s not always easy to stay committed to your purpose, especially in troublesome times.  Successful individuals will eventually achieve their reputation because their commitment was true: they approach their plans with determination and persistence.    

Commitment is most important when times get tough.  Before embarking upon a new journey, plan your future well and prepare for the worst, while always hoping for the best.  Welcome adversity because these are your challenges to overcome.  These are the obstacles that hold you back from achieving your dream.  These are tests for you to pass to show the world just how committed you are to making a difference for yourself and for others.  

My hope for our time together is that you got value and an idea or two that will help you be even more successful – personally and professionally.

            <title>Optimizing Effective &amp; Efficient Behavior for Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Optimizing Effective and Efficient Behavior for Increased Success. Ask any successful business owner or entrepreneur and they will tell you one of the number one rules to optimizing the success of a business starts with producing effective results with the greatest efficiency.  

So how do you improve your career or business by improving effectiveness and efficiency?  We begin by reviewing the difference between the two terms.

Effectiveness is the building block, while efficiency is the process of refinement.  The better you become at effecting positive results with the greatest efficiency of effort, the bigger asset you become - and so does your business.  

Optimizing effectiveness and efficiency doesn’t have any relation to IQ or intelligence levels, it‘s really an awareness of your habits.  It’s a delicate balance between effecting positive results with the least amount of energy expenditure.  This essentially means that you expend the least amount of energy with the largest return - while effectively creating the desired result.  

Improving effectiveness and efficiency may require improving organizational skills, maintaining a greater focus, task delegation, getting eight hours of sleep every night, or any other number of factors.  Although adjustments vary from person to person, the factors remain constant and compile a set of success principles.  Begin working on increasing your effectiveness and efficiency today and enjoy the benefits you receive as a result.  You'll find that you will accomplish more in less time and feel great about your progress every day.

            <title>8 Ideas for Getting Things Done…The Right Way</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 8 Ideas for Getting Things Done…The Right Way.

We all want more success and the fear of failure can often be the driving force of our actions.  We work long hours, sacrifice personal time, and even sleep.  We put our heart and soul into what we're trying to achieve, only to find that we're spinning our wheels.  We think we're getting things done, because at the end of the day all of our Action List items are crossed out; but did we really get closer to achieving our goals?  The fact is, most of us accomplish a whole list of things by the end of the day, but have little to show for it.  Your success depends on what you are doing and the way you are getting things done.  If you're not moving closer to your goal achievement, you are not getting things done the right way.

The good news is - getting things done the right way requires only a simple shift in your actions.  There are only two ways of getting things done; one way leads to your success, while the other keeps you in the same position you're in right now.  

Getting things done the right way, can take you from spinning your wheels to; creating more time, expending less effort, reducing frustration and moving you closer to your goals with every single action.  This is possible because success relies on one principle: success takes successful actions. We are going to talk about 8 ideas for getting things done the right way.

            <title>How Much Food Can I Eat? by Guest, Denis Collier</title>
            <description>Today we have a special guest.  One of the important tools I use as an accountability coach is the Wheel of Life.  The Wheel of Life I use, because not all are the same, has 8 areas that we regularly focus on.  One of those areas is health and fitness.  Our special guest, Denis Collier, is a Registered Dietitian, a Certified Exercise Physiologist and has a Masters degree in Kinesiology. The company he founded specializes in helping individuals reach their most valuable goals by integrating nutrition with a physically active lifestyle. 

As far as nutrition goes, there are tons of different topics we could discuss. Today, I would like to talk about a very fundamental concept – kind of really go back to the basics. I think a lot of people simply want to know “How much food can I eat?” 

Denis answers:
 – How much food can we eat?
-  It might be difficult to give specific recommendations on how many calories an individual needs. Are there any guidelines you can give here today for the individuals listening?
- What are the problems with calculating your Caloric requirement using just the method you described?
- How do you determine how much your client’s can actually eat?
- As it relates to how much should I eat, what do you recommend, as a registered dietitian, what percentage of fat, protein, and carbs per meal or per day should we try and eat? 

Denis provided us with some great insights and things to think about and implement so we can be healthier. For those of you who might be interested in learning more about Denis, he has a program called The Fitness Phone. The Fitness Phone is a revolutionary way to consistently access the world’s leading health and fitness experts – and you can do it from the comfort of your own home. Feel free to review his website by going to www.thefitnessphone.com.

            <title>Persistence Pays Off</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about how Persistence Pays Off.  Persistence is to success as excuses are to failure.  Never, never give up - there is always a way.

If you want more, you WILL find a way, because there always IS a way.  With persistence and consistent action you will make it happen.  If you don't believe me, listen carefully.

There are thousands of examples of ordinary people achieving extraordinary goals; these are just a few examples of how persistence paid off.  Achieving your goals requires you to take consistent action, be persistent, and maintain a resolve to simply not give up.  Here are 5 steps you can take today, to get you closer to achieving your goals.

1. Take Measurable Actions - Every Day!

2. Keep Showing Up

3. Remain Objective About Your Obstacles

4. Learn to Say “Next!”

5. Track Your Progress

The road to success isn’t always easy - but it isn’t always hard.  There may be times when you have to talk yourself through periods of self-doubt, and there will definitely be times when you defy the odds.  Never, never give up because there is always a way to achieve your goals and experience the life you truly desire.

One area in particular that I think people find confusing is the area of vitamin and mineral supplements. There are just so many products out there, and so much information. Denis will help us clear up some of the confusion on this topic and give us the straight information.

            <title>5 Tips on Making Successful Commitments That Produce Results</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 5 Tips on Making Successful Commitments That Produce Results.

Most of us cringe when we hear the word “commitment” because we associate it with feelings of sacrifice.  Our commitments fail because we get caught up in the struggle of trying to change where life seems to be taking us and where we want to go.  Our every day habits consume our thoughts - leaving no room for thoughts of why we started the process in the first place.  The diet becomes a struggle between exercise and chocolate cake; the budget becomes a struggle between spending and saving, so on and so on.

The struggle ends up consuming us and we give up trying to change because it’s just too hard.  What we thought would be efforts to lead us to a new life, end up being just a temporary change.  We’ve tried before and failed again, and the conclusion comes down to a discouraged excuse - I just couldn’t do it, I didn’t have time, or it was too hard.

The truth is making a successful commitment is nothing more than a making a choice to create a desired future outcome.  You may say that people who stick to their commitments are an exception, and you are definitely not one of those people.  Well, I’m here to tell you that commitments are not personality specific.  Each of us has the capability to set successful commitments.  So now you’re saying, if that’s the case, why do so many of us fail?  Because most people don’t know how to make the decisions that create successful commitment.
 
If you’ve tried and failed in past commitments, it doesn’t matter.  The past is the past, and you are a different person today.  Starting right now, you are now armed with the strength and the tools you need to successfully commit to creating your desired future outcome.

            <title>4 Steps to Increase the Power of Your Focus</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 4 Steps to Increase the Power of Your Focus so you can achieve your goals.

Living your life without practicing The Power of Focus, is like trying to hit the bull’s eye of a target you can’t see.  You can spend hours launching arrows, only to miss the target entirely.  You become exhausted and frustrated when your repeated efforts don’t show the results you are trying to achieve.  This is what it feels like to operate without The Power of Focus.

To get to where you want to be, you must hold clear in your mind what you most want.  Your subconscious mind is a powerful, goal-achieving machine, but it can’t lead you to your desired goal, if you don’t provide it with a specific target.  If it doesn’t have a clear and specific target, it can’t get you there.  As Stephen Covey would say, you must begin with the end in mind.

The Power of Focus is the practice of focusing on the ‘right’ tasks at hand, while minimizing distractions that take your focus away from your goals.  It will improve time management, professional and personal performance, task efficiency, overall life balance, and provide your mind the information it needs to get you to the bull’s eye.

When you focus on the ‘right’ activities that lead to ‘big’ goal achievement, you will succeed.  Today you’ll learn the 4 steps to help you increase your focus so you can have a higher probability of achieving your goals.

            <title>The 'I’m On Vacation' Mentality</title>
            <description>Today, we are honored to have an expert with us. I’ve asked him to talk about what I call the “I’m on Vacation” mentality.  Denis Collier is a Registered Dietitian, a Certified Exercise Physiologist and has a Masters degree in Kinesiology. The company he founded specializes in helping individuals reach their most valuable goals by integrating nutrition with a physically active lifestyle. 

Denis, I hear often people lamenting the fact that their efforts to eat healthily are sabotaged by different life situations; I am sure I am not alone in hearing complaints like these I bet many of the listeners today have heard them too, and maybe even uttered some of them themselves at some point! Denis, I want to talk to you today about what I call the “I’m on vacation” mentality. I would like to get your opinions on how we can prevent our health from being hijacked when we travel. I mention the “I’m on vacation mentality” because in my experience, I have often heard people use this as an excuse to forget about their health.

Are you up for the challenge?

Denis was up for the challenge.  You will really enjoy Denis’s insights and perspectives on this topic.  His interview is fun, thought-provoking, and enlightening.  

We appreciate Denis spending his time and expertise with us today.  He certainly provided us with some great insights and things to think about and implement so we can be healthier. For those of you who might be interested in learning more about Denis, he has a program called The Fitness Phone. The Fitness Phone is a revolutionary way to consistently access the world’s leading health and fitness experts – and you can do it from the comfort of your own home.

            <title>Use The Power of Your Belief to Increase Your Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Your Beliefs – Are They Helping You or Hurting You? In addition, we will discuss 7 Success Beliefs That Will Help You Be Even More Successful.

Wherever you are in your life, you are exactly where you are because of your beliefs.  When you speak to yourself what do you say - words of encouragement or words of criticism?  If you speak words of encouragement, you may have some level of confidence and be moderately successful at achieving your goals.  However, if you speak words of self-criticism, you may find that you are unsure and not as effective at achieving your goals as you would like to be.  You may not realize it, but your self-talk is creating your belief system.  That belief system is either helping you achieve more or keeping you bound where you are.  To get to where you want to go and be who you want to be, you must understand that your beliefs are the powerhouse of creation.  Who you are, as well as who you will become, is created by your beliefs.
 
When you have a high level of belief in yourself, it leaves no room for doubt, allowing you to develop a keen awareness that you are made of infinite potential and can achieve anything you believe you can.  

The reality is this, whatever you believe is what you have created and will create in your life.  A healthy belief system gives you the confidence to achieve any goal you set for yourself, 

People who have a high level of self-belief - know anything is possible.
People who don't have a high level of self-belief - hope some things will be possible.

 “If you believe you can, and believe it strongly enough, you’ll be amazed at what you can do.” –Nido Qubein

To accomplish your goals, you must believe - and your belief comes from your conviction and desire.  We will talk about how to strengthen your conviction and desire to a new level. 

Changing your circumstances and creating the life you really want starts with creating a high level of belief that allows you to feel that you can achieve anything you set your mind upon.  With conviction and desire, you will be unstoppable because you will believe that anything is possible. As a result, you will create the life you have always dreamed about having.

Success beliefs help you realize that you can do anything and any obstacles you face are only imaginary blocks created by your limiting beliefs.  We will talk about 7 success beliefs that will help you be even more successful. 

There is creation power in your belief system; so use success-oriented beliefs to create a success driven life.

“Whether you think you can or can't - either way, you are right.”  --HENRY FORD, Founder of Ford Motor Company

            <title>To Change or Not to Change – That is the Question</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about The Pros and Cons of Change.

My motto is Excuses Don’t Count unless you’re dead. Now I know this sounds harsh but excuses are just that – excuses. They don’t serve anyone and it doesn’t matter what your excuses are. You either did or didn’t do something – just that plain and simple.   In the July 2008 issue of Prevention Magazine, there was a great short article under Who We Admire. There are five ladies in a photo who all have t-shirts on with a circle and a line crossing through the word Excuses – basically meaning No Excuses.  I love it!  The article is about five ladies who just celebrated their 30th year of walking together.  They walk every single day at 6:30am, rain or shine, and have logged an estimated 25,000 miles. What an inspirational story and we should admire these five ladies.  No Excuses! They chose to change their life the way it was and begin walking and they are still going strong. They choose to do it every day, not matter what – no excuses.  I love it!

We will talk about: 
- What is change?  
-  Can People Change?
- The Pros and Cons of Change

Don’t be afraid to change just because you don’t know how the change will affect things.  I heard it said, if you continually do things the same way you will always get what you have gotten.  Explore what might be.  Ask yourself, what’s the worst thing that can happen? In most cases, it will be something desired and something good. You may not do it perfect the first time, but you will get better each time you do it. Try changing something that you have been putting off and experience the results for yourself. Enjoy!

            <title>2 Amazing Stories of Business and Personal Success</title>
            <description>We are honored today to have a very special guest.  Our guest today built a multi-million dollar financial advisory firm. However, at one point in his career, he was ready to leave the business world; not because he wasn't financially successful but because he was overweight, unhealthy &amp; unhappy. Beginning in 2004, he went through an inspiring journey losing 140 pounds of excess weight and now competes in triathlons. In other words he went from 313 pounds to 173 pounds. After mentoring 12 friends to lose a combined 321 pounds of excess weight in less than a year, he wrote the book The Fitness Race, which was published in April 2008. The Fitness Race will inspire those who struggle with their weight and give them a plan and path to get as light and fit as they choose.  

Mark Little will share a brief history as to what actually helped him decide that being 313 pounds was no longer acceptable and his decision to do something about getting lighter and fitter.  

He will also talk about the importance of accountability coaching as it applies to him in his life and in The Fitness Race.

In addition, Mark will discuss the choices he made in relationship to his eating habits.  If I recall correctly, at one point Mark ate a lot at McDonalds and still lost weight.  This isn’t a typical story you would hear from most people.

You can review Mark’s story and the story of others he has mentored at  www.TheFitnessRace.com. 

You will enjoy this interview with such an amazing person who has enjoyed and still enjoys both professional and personal success.

            <title>Effective Time Management for Increased Success</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Effective Time Management and Calendaring so you can focus on the ‘right’ activities and have increased success.

One of the success principles of any successful person is effectively calendaring and time management.  In order to create your ideal life, you must learn to schedule EVERYTHING and be extremely effective at time management.    

What are the highest payoff activities you can do to achieve your goals in the timeframe you have set? You may want to make sure you spend more of your time on these activities versus other lower payoff activities. Work on those activities that produce the results you want and not the ones that might be easier to do or more fun or don’t cause you to go outside your comfort zone.  Prioritization is very important in effectively managing your time.

Start making a list of activities you would like to put on your calendar for the next week or few weeks. Put them on your calendar and then honor thy calendar. What do you want to accomplish today, tomorrow, next week, this quarter, and this year?  

I can’t stress enough the importance of calendaring and then honoring your calendar.  You will find yourself more in control of your life and you will be even more efficient.  You becoming very effective at time management will have a positive impact on your life – personally and professionally.  You might be amazed at how much more productive you will be when you apply effective time management in your life.  This is an important and key success factor and you must be skilled at maximizing your time.  Focus on the results you want today, next week, next month, this year, and with every conversation and activity you do.  Create your reality!  You can do it! </description>

            <itunes:summary>Today we are going to talk about Effective Time Management and Calendaring so you can focus on the ‘right’ activities and have increased success.

One of the success principles of any successful person is effectively calendaring and time management.  In order to create your ideal life, you must learn to schedule EVERYTHING and be extremely effective at time management.    

What are the highest payoff activities you can do to achieve your goals in the timeframe you have set? You may want to make sure you spend more of your time on these activities versus other lower payoff activities. Work on those activities that produce the results you want and not the ones that might be easier to do or more fun or don’t cause you to go outside your comfort zone.  Prioritization is very important in effectively managing your time.

            <title>5 step process to improve your health and fitness</title>
            <description>Some of you listeners today may know, but not all might, one of the important tools I use as an accountability coach with the people I work with is the Wheel of Life.  The Wheel of Life I use, because not all are the same, has 8 areas that we regularly focus on.  One of those areas is health and fitness.  Most of the people I work with and many of the people I talk to, at one point in life have tried to lose weight or thought about losing a few pounds so they could be fitter and healthier and ultimately feel better and maybe even live longer.  If you have tried to lose weight or thought about it, you are certainly in the majority. If you would like to improve your health and fitness and maybe even lose a few pounds in the process – this special interview we are doing today is for you.

We are honored today to have an expert with us to talk about health and fitness.  Denis Collier is a Registered Dietitian, a Certified Exercise Physiologist and has a Masters degree in Kinesiology. The company he founded specializes in helping individuals reach their most valuable goals by integrating nutrition with a physically active lifestyle. 

We are talking about how many people say they have tried repeatedly to lose weight and had little to no success. Some have probably thought about losing weight but maybe don’t have a plan or know the best way to approach being healthier and fitter.  

Denis shares a 5 step approach, a system of “arguing with yourself” to rid yourself of negative beliefs and become more optimistic about doing the things you need to do to lose weight and improve your health, fitness and quality of life in general.  He calls it the “A.E.I.O.U. Technique”.  

Listen and learn! You will receive value from this special interview with our expert, Denis Collier. </description>

            <title>10 Principles to Eliminate Distractions and Achieve Goals</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about 10 Principles to Eliminate Distractions So You Can Achieve Your Goals Sooner.  

Through my years of coaching people, I have found that we're all guilty of allowing the little things to distract us from what we should be doing. This happens to all of us to some degree or another.  

Whether you are an employee or self-employed, your income depends solely on you.  And the more efficiently you can work the bigger returns you will receive.  Take a moment and ask yourself where you truly want to be?  Now tell yourself how many things you did today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday that directly contributed to the future results you want.  And then tell yourself how many things you did today that did not contribute to your success.  Those things probably distracted you from what you knew you should have been doing.

Minimize distractions and you'll reach your goals faster - plain and simple.  You must minimize distractions and focus on the tasks that have a positive effect on your success.  All of the ten principles we will talk about today can be applied to reduce and eliminate distractions from your life.

Wouldn’t it be great if our ‘good intentions’ worked the way that we think they should?  Not even enthusiasm guarantees positive results. There’s often a wide gap between our intentions and our actions.  We fail to take the action necessary to be in alignment with our good intentions. We allow things to distract us way too much each and every day.   

Eliminate distractions and you have an even better chance of acting on your good intentions and achieving amazing results!  Aim for what you want each and every day!  </description>

            <title>Creating your Ideal Client Profile and Replicating Them</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about Creating Your Ideal Client Profile and replicating them.  

I believe that if you are crystal clear about what you want and you focus on it, you will attract it. Do you believe this? If you aren’t clear about what you really want, how can you communicate this to anyone who might ask you or attract these kinds of people to you. The universe doesn’t know exactly what you are looking for – and neither do you.  That is why  you need to have an Ideal Client Profile and have it in writing.

Life is for enjoying, don’t waste time with people you want enjoy or want to be around. Imagine your company with only clients who provide you the revenue to life the lifestyle you want and you actually enjoy servicing. We will review several options of an Ideal Client Profile during our time together. By the end of our time, you should have a better idea of what you want so you can go and attract it.

Many people focus on the masses, hoping to find an Ideal Client during the process.  When you focus on only attracting Ideal Clients, you still may attract other people who don’t quite fit and you can choose to accept them or not.  This might be a more powerful concept to consider applying because most people typically need fewer of the “right” clients than if they aren’t focused and take anyone. 

Next you want to apply the power of replicating only your Ideal Clients.

With this valuable information of your Ideal Client Profile in hand, you can create a business management tool I call “Slots and Replication” to track your acquisition of great clients and keep you aware of how many more are needed for you to reach your goals. You will learn how to do this from this call.

Figure out exactly what you want, state it clearly, and allow the “replicators” to work for you. Reap the rewards!

            <title>Eliminate the No Longer Acceptable Things in Your Life</title>
            <description>Many of us say we’re going to make changes to eliminate the things we don‘t like about our life, but few of us actually commit to improving the quality of our life.  We stay in a job we don’t like and in a relationship that does not serve us, and blame our circumstances on the “hand” we’ve been dealt in life.  

If you have ever felt like this - it’s time to get a dose of reality.  Whether you’re sick of your financial situation, your health or destructive relationships, you have the power to eliminate the “no longer acceptables” in your life and create the life you want and deserve.

Give up the excuses because they are just plain cop-outs. Creating the life you want simply begins with a choice - you choose to eliminate the “no longer acceptables” in your life. Changing your life circumstances is that easy. You choose your desired reality instead of your current reality, and commit to doing whatever it takes in order to create it.

While some people will live their entire life believing they are bound by their current circumstances, it does not have to be that way for you. There is no written law that says you have to live in fear, unhappiness or depression - in fact, it’s quite the opposite.  We are created with unlimited potential, but can be falsely led to believe that we are not good enough to have what we really want. Whether you were told you deserved exactly what you got, or picked up bad habits that sabotaged your success - none of that matters. Your life can change the very instant you change your thoughts - right here, right now.

Eliminating those things you find yourself being most unhappy with will allow so much more peace and emotional space. You will feel like a new person when you finally eliminate the things that have been holding you back from what you really want.

Here are 5 practical steps you can take to start eliminating the “no longer acceptables” from your life.

            <media:text xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" type="plain">Many of us say we’re going to make changes to eliminate the things we don‘t like about our life, but few of us actually commit to improving the quality of our life.  We stay in a job we don’t like and in a relationship that does not serve us, and blame our circumstances on the “hand” we’ve been dealt in life.  

If you have ever felt like this - it’s time to get a dose of reality.  Whether you’re sick of your financial situation, your health or destructive relationships, you have the power to eliminate the “no longer acceptables” in your life and create the life you want and deserve.

Give up the excuses because they are just plain cop-outs. Creating the life you want simply begins with a choice - you choose to eliminate the “no longer acceptables” in your life. Changing your life circumstances is that easy. You choose your desired reality instead of your current reality, and commit to doing whatever it takes in order to create it.

While some people will live their entire life believing they are bound by their current circumstances, it does not have to be that way for you. There is no written law that says you have to live in fear, unhappiness or depression - in fact, it’s quite the opposite.  We are created with unlimited potential, but can be falsely led to believe that we are not good enough to have what we really want. Whether you were told you deserved exactly what you got, or picked up bad habits that sabotaged your success - none of that matters. Your life can change the very instant you change your thoughts - right here, right now.

Eliminating those things you find yourself being most unhappy with will allow so much more peace and emotional space. You will feel like a new person when you finally eliminate the things that have been holding you back from what you really want.

Here are 5 practical steps you can take to start eliminating the “no longer acceptables” from your life.

            <title>Reduce and Eliminate Time Wasters from your Life</title>
            <description>The bottom line is that anyone who has a demanding career or runs their own business has to practice excellent time management, effective delegation and learning to say the word, “No.” It’s just not possible to maintain the simple life while achieving a high level of success and with today’s technology; it’s harder to hide when you need a break.  Your email inbox is dinging, your cell phone is ringing, and your spouse or significant other is trying to call you on the car phone because your cell phone is busy.  

It is at this point that you have to filter the input so you can begin to regain control over your life. As good as you think you may be with your time management; there are probably “time-wasters” that can be eliminated from your daily life.  

The goal is to slow down and be focused on the highest pay-off activities that will produce the results you desire in the timeframe you want – personally and professionally.  The goal is not to figure out how to move faster.  It’s impossible to create more hours in the day and it’s simply not healthy to run at full tilt constantly.  Learn how to eliminate the time-wasters in your life to improve your quality of life and success.  Stop trying to make something “perfect” right now when it is effective the way it is.  It may never be “perfect.” 

Time-wasters do nothing but impede or delay the ideal life you are committed to creating. The good news is they are simple to eliminate. They simply become something you used to do when you were okay with staying where you were. The difference now is that you are ready to move on and create your ideal life – and letting them go is a snap.

            <title>Stop Procrastinating and Making Excuses</title>
            <description>Following through is the key component of goal achievement. When you stop procrastinating and follow through on your good intentions, you turn your intentions into tangible results. Yet our intentions don’t always control our actions. Even when we start out strong and act on our good intentions, most people will slip back into their old habits in a short period of time. All the enthusiasm, gusto, and zeal in the world cannot guarantee results. Even the best of intentions will not magically move us forward.

The best excuses in the world are still just excuses – and excuses are just another obstacle on your journey to achieving your goals. 

The biggest problem most people face when trying to achieve their goals is lack of accountability. If you are only reporting to yourself, procrastination becomes easy. “I’ll start tomorrow,” or “I’ll make this my New Year’s Eve resolution,” or “I’ll eat this cheesecake now and start my diet tomorrow,” is most people’s mantra.

Unfortunately, tomorrow becomes next week, next week becomes next month, and eventually next month becomes never. People think they know what they want, but believe that they don’t have the will power or determination to actually take steps toward their goals. We are all human.  We all need help and support.  Nobody succeeds alone.

So how do individuals who are lacking the “follow through” gene still produce results? How do you alter your good intentions to produce the follow through necessary for action?  Listen and find out. 

Begin enjoying the experience of an even greater life quality and total life balance.  Aim for what you want each and every day!  Until next time, make it a great day, today and every day!</description>

            <title>The Quality of Life Enhancer(tm) Exercise</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about a great tool called The Quality of Life Enhancer Exercise. Almost everyone has lamented, at one time or another, about not having enough time in the day.  Have you ever said or thought, “I wish I had more time?”, “If I had more time, I would _____.”, “If there were a few more hours in this day, I could _____.”  Most of us, at some time or another, have probably thought or said this to ourselves and heard others say something like this too.

The truth is, even if we had five extra hours each day, we would probably still misuse the time and bemoan our inability to finish everything with which we task ourselves. 

The Quality of Life Enhancer™ Exercise is a powerful tool, created by my husband, Bill Bachrach, Founder and Chairman of Bachrach &amp; Associates, Inc.  The through-provoking and fun exercise is based on two principles.

You will enjoy listening to this Podcast and completing your personal Quality of Life Enhancer(tm) Exercise at www.AccountabilityCoach.com. It is a FREE resource available to everyone.  Update yours as often as you like and share this great resource with everyone you know.</description>

            <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you could have everything you want out of life magically appear with the snap of a finger? Unfortunately as the old adage says, “You can’t get something for nothing.” The secret to achieving your goals boils down to one thing – taking action. There isn’t some magic gene that is only given to a select few at birth – achieving your goals is an inherent ability in all of us. 

You can achieve absolutely any goal you can imagine, so long as you get moving in the right direction now! One of the benefits of taking action is that your progress is the very thing that bridges the gap between imagining a dream and manifesting it.  In other words …

Action = Results!

Take action now and jump start your 2009!

            <title>The Choices we Make and how they Impact our Life</title>
            <description>You may have heard it said that it is the little things in life that are worth living for.  Similarly, the little things in life are what change our lives for the better or worse.  The choices we make in life define who we are and what we will eventually become.  

The truth of the matter is that a happy life is all about choices and progress. We make choices to the best of our abilities and then progress forward.  The most successful people in life believe that they have a purpose and that they will achieve that purpose, goal by goal.  

Jack Welch, arguably the greatest CEO of our time, held the philosophy, “Tell me the truth, and tell me early.”  Truthfulness and believability always have appeal.  The truth has power. If you tell the truth, you begin to play in a new league; you walk away from the games of salesmanship and into the realm of reality as a true professional that people seek and want to work with.  Sometimes it is good to have a thought you don’t express, as my husband Bill says.  On the other hand, it is sometimes good to have thoughts you do express.  You almost always have a choice.</description>

Jack Welch, arguably the greatest CEO of our time, held the philosophy, “Tell me the truth, and tell me early.”  Truthfulness and believability always have appeal.  The truth has power. If you tell the truth, you begin to play in a new league; you walk away from the games of salesmanship and into the realm of reality as a true professional that people seek and want to work with.  Sometimes it is good to have a thought you don’t express, as my husband Bill says.  On the other hand, it is sometimes good to have thoughts you do express.  You almost always have a choice.</media:text>

            <title>Create Your Personal Wheel of Life</title>
            <description>Today we are going to talk about The Wheel of Life and how it can help you put into perspective how balanced your life is now, and how using The Wheel of Life periodically will help you make progress and keep on track to continuing your journey for total life balance. The Wheel of Life is what I use as a starting point for the goal-setting process. The Wheel of Life helps you focus on the activities required to achieve your goals and ultimately obtain what is truly important to you in life.

The goal of the exercise is to help you create a wheel of life that is as round as possible; therefore, creating total balance in your life. When the wheel is out of balance, life is like a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Your professional life is up, but your romantic life is down. A person could be in excellent physical health, but suffering from their poor relationships with family and friends. These constant ups and downs take a toll on a person’s overall quality of life.

The Wheel of Life I use has 8 areas to it and that you continually focus on. 
1.	Fitness and Health
2.	Family &amp; Friends
3.	Romance/S.O. / Partner
4.	Money
5.	Career
6.	Fun &amp; Recreation
7.	Spiritual Development/Personal Growth
8.	Physical Environment
