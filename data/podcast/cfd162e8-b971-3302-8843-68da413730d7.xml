                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;It's time to give thanks during our 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; episode of Adventures in Design, &amp;ldquo;Gleaming The Cubism".&amp;nbsp; We've whipped up a delectable episode for your eardrums to feast upon this Thanksgiving.&amp;nbsp; James, Billy, and Mark share what they are thankful for this year, making everyone feel good from top to bottom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; min-height: 15px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Mark gets nostalgic over missing out on Dairy Queen Blizzards this year, and he reveals that he has an ongoing issue with sprinkles.&amp;nbsp; (It's a lifestyle choice, really.) He can, however, get into the sport of arguing.&amp;nbsp; James and Billy try to convince Mark that it's okay to watch TV show previews, but he's just not that interested in what they have to say.&amp;nbsp; Rather, our outspoken host bluntly reveals his stance on bullying, and how it helped shape him into becoming the World's Best Podcaster as he is known today.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Our guest is the prolific artist known for his legendary body of skateboard graphics, Don Pendleton.&amp;nbsp; Don began skateboarding in the mid eighties at the age of 14, and has been a part of skateboarding culture for over 20 years, 15 of which have been dedicated to producing skateboard art.&amp;nbsp; Mark and Don talk about the culture of action sports and the connection between art and skateboarding.&amp;nbsp; The Do-It-Yourself approach was a homemade outlet for creativity, offering up fresh opportunities to develop new tricks, to make music in bands, and more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As you prepare to gather around your family this Thanksgiving, pull up a chair next to your uncle Buck, put on your headphones, and share your holiday with us instead.&amp;nbsp; Our shop talk will get you into the spirit of Thanksgiving as Mark tells a story about committing food adultery. And as many of you get a few days off work, the work for us hardly ever ends.&amp;nbsp; James discusses what its like working on the weekends, and how there's solidarity in numbers.&amp;nbsp; Plus, we've got a grand announcement at the end of the show that you won't wanna miss!&amp;nbsp; May the future be with you...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Billy shares his experiences with accidental porn at work, and we discover Mark's pavlovian reaction to sexually explicit materials. &amp;nbsp;Is James Flames wearing pants? &amp;nbsp;(We'll never tell.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From across the pond, we are so pleased to welcome our friend, Matt Taylor, feather hat and all. &amp;nbsp;We talk design, clients, and the WWF. (You know, wrestling. The real stuff. Not some animal bullshit.) We're so excited to be back in the studio that we just don't want this episode to ever end. &amp;nbsp;The musk is seeping through the airwaves. Join us for an extended listen of our &amp;ldquo;dirty thirty&amp;rdquo; episode. &amp;nbsp; Have your tissues on standby, AID XXX is going to blow you...away.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mark &amp;ldquo;Babyface&amp;rdquo; Brickey has a cobra-like appetite for countin' burgers and estimating dead cats in our 29&lt;sup&gt;th,&lt;/sup&gt; succulent episode of Adventures in Design. Join us as our three favorite &amp;ldquo;Big Cheeseburgers&amp;rdquo;, Mark, Billy, and James, get a hearty education in the arts at Minot State University.&amp;nbsp; Discover Mark's love/hate relationship with poetry, find out what you can learn from the elegant piece of cinema known as 8 Mile, and encounter travel lessons regarding the proper use of double beds in your hotel room.&amp;nbsp; We'll be web-slingin' from topic to topic, from the Death Star to Jurassic Park.&amp;nbsp; Plus, great music is woven throughout this lively episode by local, Folk/Americana band, Wild Hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We've gotta admit, North Dakota has some of the nicest people in the real, 48 states, but where are all the fucking buildings here?&amp;nbsp; Is it just us, or is there such a thing as too much space?&amp;nbsp; I'm afraid we're experiencing early symptoms of 'Spaceophobia'.&amp;nbsp; The only cure?&amp;nbsp; Surrounding our artsy-fartsy, city hearts with some truly, down-home guests for a casual chat about design culture here in the &amp;ldquo;Magic City&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We begin with Bill Harbort and Laurie Geller, co-founders and &amp;ldquo;Fathers&amp;rdquo; of Notstock, an entertaining, multi-day, arts event hosted by Minot State University.&amp;nbsp; Laurie discusses the mission of Notstock and how area schools and the community are becoming engaged in the arts, while we ask Bill to talk with us about his passion for American muscle cars and the direct influence these majestic pieces of machinery have on his work.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Next, Dan Sharbono and Alyssa Weyrauch Sharbono, creative team of 62 Doors Gallery and Studios discuss the adaptability of artists, how environmental setbacks and the growing oil industry are swiftly shaping the landscape for artists seeking space in Minot, and more. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Shop Talk is bigger and better than ever, jam-packed with essential design resources. The boys unlock the secrets behind Delicious Design League's registration process and add expert advice on film placement when burning your screens.&amp;nbsp; The boys keep you informed about issues developing in the printmaking arena as the process gain popularity in the craft fair circuit. Billy gives James art direction on his horrible, gig poster concepts, and finally, we welcome our friend Takuma to the couch to discuss Japanese culture and refrigerators with us.&amp;nbsp; Join us for maniacal laughs down at the student union, The Beaverchomp, the almost certainly fictional name for what we imagine colleges like name these sorts of things, for an indispensable 29th edition of Adventures in Design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Just a year and half ago, the first episode of Adventures in Design was released. One of the first things ever heard on the show was "Worst Podcast Ever". Fast forward to today and the show starts of boasting "World's Greatest Design Podcast", but don't worry soon there after the conversation shifts to being the best at podcasting is close to being useless (even while celebrating great success the boys can still keep it humble). Switching over to their famous random chit chat the guys all marvel at how manly Billy is for building a staircase on the back of his house, Mark talks about accidentally stumbling into a Sea Festival, talking to podcast listeners in the wild, what they each look for in picking a guests for the show and of course they guys all rally around the future fun of their August appearance in Cleveland for Weapons of Mass Creation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Illustrator Tom Whalen stops by the show to let everyone know that his career is just as fun as it seems on French paper. Tom goes into his origin story and explains how stumbled upon his minimalistic design style while in art school. Mark explains to Tom that Steamboat Willy was the first ever Mickey Mouse cartoon as the team discusses Southern California's love for Disneyland and they all talk about the scene at comic shows. A good discussion breaks out on is taking the higher moral road the best way to "kickstart" a career or do short cuts pay off professionally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;During the world famous Shop Talk segment the topics range from the rich getting richer, is Obey a cool brand or not, taking your eye off the career ball and losing momentum quickly, Mark offers relationship advice and where to go to meet women when you're a designer, the ongoing discussion of timed edition prints and collect ability, a open hate session on Will Smith, the pleasure in making customers happy versus clients, Eagles football, how to explain pricing models to your clients, always asking for a deposit upfront, how getting paid upfront sucks for motivation and lastly a nice thank you to everyone for helping the show reach 100,000 downloads! All of this and a couple of surprises are awaiting you on your next Adventure In Design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Episode 24 starts of with a big announcement that will change the sound of the show, for the first time EVER we find our Adventure In Design starting of with not just 2 voices but 3, that's right the&amp;nbsp; announcement that James Flames will be joining the show as a full time on air personality/producer. This is great news for all the Team James Flames people out there in podcast land. Not only do the boys introduce a new full time me member to the show but they also introduce a new design game that will certainly sweep the design community by storm Hire, Retire &amp;amp; Fire. Watch your ass could you easily be the next person to get fired by the maniacs at Adventures in Design. Speaking of getting hired, the guys talk about their upcoming live shows at Gallery F in Chicago this July and their headlining appearance in August at Weapons of Mass Creation Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. You can hear the excitement building as the AID summer tour season is quickly approaching, make sure you check out one of this summer's LIVE show recordings or invite the podcast to come out to your city for a design experience like none other on planet earth. If you really want a unique listener experience you can always go out to eat with Mark, in episode 24 Billy and James talk about some of their favorite times out on the road breaking bread and coeds with Mark. However, sharing a dinner out on the town isn't the only way to enjoy some time with Mr. Brickey, you can always instead just ask him to spell words for you, which can be hours on entertainment. Lastly, what wouldn't an episode of the show be without some good ol fashioned complaining about shitty Kickstarter campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Next up Dan Ibarra, from Aesthetic Apparatus, makes his third appearance on the show to introduce the Circle of Trust to Schoolha.us the new group-mentorship program by AA. Dan quickly informs everyone to the new way of thinking going on over at camp AA and Dan also defines that 3 or more people are needed to have a crew. Explaining what they feel is wrong with the current design education process Dan gives a glimpse into the different methods of learning and team building that they hope to create with Schoolha.us. Having a goal and wanting to learn is the key dynamic to being a successful part of the Schoolha.us program, simply put you learn what you want to learn and when you feel you're done, you're done&amp;hellip; No more "force feeding" style of studio education. Learn more by visiting their new website here: http://schoolha.us As with all things Adventures In Design, eventually the guys debate on the long term effects that Schoolha.us may have on Aesthetic Apparatus. So even if you're a well seasoned pro, you can hopefully relate to the delicate balance of being selfless/selfish with your career, doing what you love and what you have to do, to make a honest living.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Keeping with the educational theme of Schoolha.us during Shop Talk the crew all discuss what they do and don't want to see in student portfolios and their expectations in conversation during the interview process. Moving over to their own work, more specifically showing new work to clients, the guys all discuss managing early client expectations and trying to not let folks leap to ridiculous conclusions on early rounds of work. Also, a lengthy discussion occurs when Mark shares his frustration with clients simply changing their minds and really the scope of projects in the middle of a ongoing job and how this can really effect the designer's bottom line if they don't take up for themselves. Comparing clients to 3 year olds, double taking your way out of jam and standing up for good design are just a few of the bullet points in possibly the longest ever AID discussion on dealing with those that hire you to do what you do&amp;hellip; and to hopefully do it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Every now and again the show even talks about the art of design&amp;hellip; Billy initiates a very interesting conversation on a recent Man of Steel poster curated by Mondo. Everyone takes a turn talking about designer influence and paying tribute while still leaving your own fingerprints on your work. See attached graphic below to visually see the conversation about his print and it's rich history and ever richer future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

He's a regular listener to the show, and president of the Australian Circle of Trust, making him fit right into the conversation with Mark and Billy. Over the span of a 100 minutes the boys cover: How Ken Taylor got his start in Australia and eventually became a well known name in the US poster scene, debate the difference between designing music, movie and art posters, Ken talks about his process and getting lost in the details while working, the amount of time he spends making these pieces, properly pricing jobs, negotiating with clients and Ken even talks about buying and trading posters at Flatstock in Austin, Texas and lastly what posters he has hanging on his own walls at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Episode 20 "A Tale of Two Brickeys"&amp;nbsp; - Recorded in two parts. Act one of Mark and Billy's latest adventure was recorded on the eve of Mark's cross country flight to find a new home in Southern California. The show starts with a lengthy, super late, Super Bowl commercial critique where Mark &amp;amp; Billy rate their favorite billion dollars ads and then rant on all those that they hated during America's largest annual Television event. The show then takes a turn where Mark shed's insight into his nervousness and fears for what lies ahead for him the next day. On the eve of a life long dream, to relocate to the Los Angeles area, Mark looks to Billy for insight into Billy's move to Chicago. In one of the more genuine segments of the show's history, Adventures In Design starts to sound much more like two great friends talking on the phone, rather than a recorded podcast for the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Act two was recorded one week later where we find out the results of Mark's cross country dreams and find our host in a very different state of mind than we did in act one. Due to a couple of technical problems we find Mark and Billy joined by a surprise guest, non other than James Flames. The known AID trio sits back and have their usual Shop Talk rants and raves where they discuss being interviewed for books, finding an agent, managing supply and demand and whatever else pops into their heads. All while being joined by a very special guest, the talented Dan Kuhklen of DKNG Studios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;Recorded in 5 different cities and edited while flying from coast to coast, the newest Adventure In Design is indeed the tale of two sides of the human mind&amp;hellip; The fear of failure and the celebration of succeeding. If you have ever been scared to relocate for your path in life, may this episode be your companion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;The 19th adventure takes off with Mark broadcasting "live" from his in-laws fiery warm basement in Cheektowaga, NY. Now that Mark is officially homeless, and has nothing but time on his hands, during a 4 month break from design, he and Billy catch up on what they have both been doing since we last found them at the end of November 2012. They also talk about the victory in launching their new show website AIDpodcast.com and how getting that project off of the ground has been a blessing. While discussing Mark's upcoming cross country road trip Billy comes up with the genius idea that they should gather design questions for Mark to ask of strangers along the way from New York&amp;nbsp; to California. After a heated discussion of standardized goalie masks in the NHL the boys need to cool their jets and take a music break before getting a James Flames hosted shop talk going. In the midst of the audio break, due to not currently having a phone line, Mark shares a classic telemarketer call where a accidental wrong number leads to one memorable email address. The call was made in 2003 long before Adventures In Design had hit the airwaves or Hero had ever even printed their first poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;James Flames joins the show for his fourth show appearance and third time sitting in on Shop Talk. Out of the gate Mark complains about how shitty CG cartoons are these days, Billy offers some contemporary children's cartoons worthy of checking out and then the whole gang reminisces on watching TV after school back in the day. The gang also tries to figure out the exact label for what it is they all do for a living, which for the fist time in show history, leaves everyone speechless. Even though no one seems to know the exact label the guys share a discussion on how almost everyone's New Year's Design Resolutions where hitting the same themes, the boys debate whether one can ever truly have a proper life balance while owning their own business. Mark and Billy confess their South By Southwest secrets to James and he's not happy with what he hears.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"&gt;In a interactive media loop, the podcast comments on recent blog drama that has taken place on their website AIDpodcast.com where Calm The Ham and couple of internet tumbleweeds get called out in the discussion. Joking about their new self proclaimed stance as the "TMZ" or "60 Minutes" of the poster world, the discussion goes deep into exploring why some people may choose to be "inspired by" and why others just get greedy, and can't seem to exist in the gray areas of the law. In a weird twist of commentary Mark and Billy debate what their level of customer service should be to those that stop by the website or listen to the show. Then in a moment of loosing his mind Mark decides that designers should start sticking together in the same way that cops do! All of this and more is awaiting you through the brotherhood of design known as Adventures In Design Episode 19.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The show kicks off with some very rowdy nonsense by Mark &amp;amp; Billy and bookends nicely with a very heartfelt Shop Talk featuring James Flames, where for a minute you forget that the boys are sitting on a stage, in a very crowded room, because quite honestly it starts to sound like three great friends discussing their careers along with hopes and dreams for the new year. Sit back in enjoy the BEST episode yet of Adventures In Design! Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays To All!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Hum of Hate&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;If shitting out nuggets of wisdom we&amp;rsquo;re a paid gig, Mark and Billy would be living the good life out in Beverly Hills with Will Smith and the guy who played Balki Bartakamous on Perfect Strangers.&amp;nbsp; Welcome back faithful listeners to adventure no.14 a.k.a. The Hum of Hate&amp;hellip;Truer words have never been spoken about design, and about life really. But like they do every episode, the guys set out to examine the details surrounding this sentiment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At the top of the show we are treated to some select stories about Billy&amp;rsquo;s rapidly approaching wedding (congrats Billy, by the way), and Mark goes off on a rant about his contempt for those who wish to reduce the mustache to a mere novelty. While most men with handlebar mustaches look like they should be engaged in almost constant conversation about kazoos, I must side with Mark on this one (Mark was in my wedding and one of three handlebar mustachioed men including myself). Next up is a rousing edition of &amp;ldquo;Mark fucks with Telemarketers&amp;rdquo; in where a very willing salesman seems way too aroused at the prospect of being drawn by an &amp;ldquo;artist&amp;rdquo; over the phone. On to my favorite part of the show &lt;i&gt;Shop Talk&lt;/i&gt;, this is where bullshit artists like me get the real scoop on what&amp;rsquo;s goes on in the world of graphic design. Joining the guys this week is none other than the inimitable Dan Ibarra of Aesthetic Apparatus. Fresh off a new Typeface release and knee deep in the middle of creating a line of gift-able items called &amp;ldquo;Haute Crap&amp;rdquo;, Dan helps weigh in on a few key issues. The guys answer some listener questions about the economy of using a 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8px; letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"&gt; party printer from the standpoint of the struggling designer, and Dan makes some great points about the value of the passion that is required in order to have a successful business----that and making sure you don&amp;rsquo;t squander all your profits on cocaine. Things start to heat up when Billy reveals just how much he judges other poster artist&amp;rsquo;s ability&amp;hellip;errrr&amp;hellip;umm, inability to properly screen-print, causing what is sure to be an instant loss in newbie poster artist listenership. Bringing the topic back into the realm of Simplify vs. Detailed, the guys compare the work of two prominent poster artists, Jason Munn and Aaron Horkey. Through this debate, we are reminded of the benefits of both schools of design thought to the point where both artists&amp;rsquo; work can be equally appreciated. Finally, the guys discuss the economy and the ethics of submitting your work to a Gallery show, is it worth your time and effort as an artist? Fuck if I know, I just write the copy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that the live show is September 26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8px; letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"&gt;, 2012.

In the chitter chatter of non design related topics you'll hear about rescuing dogs and the first ever guy's only segment featuring "Uncle Brickey's Recipe For Perfect Summer Balls". This time around the Circle of Trust goes north of the border to Montreal, Quebec to interview Raymond Biesinger a international man of editorial illustration. Raymond, a regular listener of the show, fits in well as the third wheel and openly talks about how he got into making editorial illustration his main design discipline and at times being the in the sweet spot of turning down 2-3 jobs for every one job that he agrees to. Raymond also shines a little light on to getting clients to "Auction for your time" and about how important it is for him to make sure that his client projects provide enough finical security so that he can afford to get involved in his own passion projects that normally have little to no money attached to them. A great honest and modest interview that intelligently explains the difference between illustration and design careers, his love of history and 101 things you probably didn't know about Canada. During the world famous "shop talk" segment, the show covers the topics of how the creative process works for Mark &amp;amp; Billy individually, advice on when to price a project and how to react to unsettling feedback from your clients. Plus, where to sell your prints online, thoughts on the poster collector website Expresso Beans, advice on picking a good art festival, all of these topics and many more are waiting for you on this episode of Adventures In Design.&lt;/p&gt;

Mitch Putnam run's the popular poster blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://omgposters.com/" target="_blank"&gt;omgposters.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Rob Jones is a Grammy winning, seasoned poster veteran who is probably most known for his ongoing working relationship with Jack White and all of Jack's musical projects. Mitch &amp;amp; Rob are also 2/3 of the poster powerhouse Mondo, the company that releases some of the finest posters in our art movement. Mondo acts as the middle man between big movie studios and amazing DIY illustrator /designers around the globe. With these four highway men in the studio together, the conversation covers the past, present, and future of poster making, as well as what goes into creating original artwork for various medias, like movies, bands, etc. Aside from this fascinating look into one of the biggest names in today's poster world, episode 9 as always, covers a wide range of design, business and personal topics that Mark and Billy have encountered since the last time they sat down to have this conversation with you.&lt;/p&gt;
