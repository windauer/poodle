&lt;p&gt;	Helen, do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?  Say hello and tell us what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Hi.  So I&amp;#8217;m Helen, and I&amp;#8217;m the Director of Platform Experience at 10up, a really awesome Web agency that focuses on publishing experiences and doing really cool things for clients.  And I&amp;#8217;m also a WordPress Core committer and the 4.0 release lead, and that&amp;#8217;s, for the most part, what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing with my time recently.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Helen, when did you get started with WordPress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Oh, man.  So I started with WordPress as a user.  I used Blogger when I was in high school, I guess, so 2002, 2001, that kind of area.  And I ended up going to college for music, and didn&amp;#8217;t really blog or really do much on the Internet anymore.  I then went to grad school, that kind of thing, and realized, hey, I&amp;#8217;m probably needing to become a professional musician, and I should probably have a website because that&amp;#8217;s what people do these days is look people up on the Internet and MySpace.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would be like, oh, why don&amp;#8217;t you use MySpace?  They do band pages.  It&amp;#8217;s like, I play classical piano. It seems really weird, so I should probably learn about making my own website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I looked at Blogger because I was like this is familiar to me.  But, at the time, Blogger didn&amp;#8217;t do pages.  They just did posts.  And somebody I knew who runs a blog on Blogger was like, well, have you ever looked at WordPress.  I&amp;#8217;m curious what you think of WordPress.  And I was like, I don&amp;#8217;t know.  No, I haven&amp;#8217;t, but I&amp;#8217;ll try this since I need to make a website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up making a static website because I didn&amp;#8217;t know how to make my own theme in WordPress or anything like that, but I did start a blog using WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So you had static pages and then one page was the blog that was WordPress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I think it was installed on a sub-domain or something.  I think it was totally separate.  They weren&amp;#8217;t related.  It was more like I thought maybe I could use something for my website, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out how to do it, so I went back to just a plain….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  I remember doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	There was a little bit of PHP.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Having websites that where part of it was just static and then I had another part that was WordPress whether it was a blog.  I remember at one point I even had random header sections that were part of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  Yeah, I don&amp;#8217;t think I did anything all that complicated.  I was working in the computer lab at the time as a grad student and the tech people and the ed tech people were like, hey, you know, you&amp;#8217;re sitting here.  Maybe you should learn a little bit about PHP and MySQL because it&amp;#8217;s what we use on our website.  Maybe you could edit a couple of pages related to things that you do at the school.  I was like, cool, that sounds pretty sweet because I had done some C++ and Java in high school and college, so if you&amp;#8217;ve ever done C++ or Java, it translates to PHP pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it definitely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	So I picked it up pretty quickly.  Yeah, I didn&amp;#8217;t know anything about WordPress.  Then, after I graduated with my Masters Degree, I decided to stay there, where I was, for grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	At the tech lab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	No, not like to stay in the computer lab forever.  I decided to stay in Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Where I went for grad school, and didn&amp;#8217;t have anything to do.  It&amp;#8217;s really hard to be a full-time, professional musician in an area that has a large music school because there are so many students.  And they hired me as the Web developer at the music conservatory, a Web developer, and so I started working on the website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	At some point we did &amp;#8212; we had to do a blog site for something related to the school.  I was like, well, I&amp;#8217;ve used WordPress, and it seems pretty cool and really easy to use, so we should do that.  So I made my first full on WordPress site.  It was pretty simple, but it was a custom theme, and I had no idea what I was doing.  I think about it now.  I&amp;#8217;m sure there were tons of terrible plugins and who knows what I was doing in the theme even though it was fairly simple in terms of, like, they were just posts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	But that&amp;#8217;s what I did and, because I was using it, I thought I should know what&amp;#8217;s happening with the software.  I don&amp;#8217;t like just blindly using things.  That&amp;#8217;s sort of like a core thing about me is I just have to know more all the time when I&amp;#8217;m doing something.  So I started sort of following along with what was happening in WordPress, like using the betas and reading the WordPress.org news announcements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I saw that they were working on &amp;#8212; so this was during 2.8, 2.8 and 2.9.  And then I saw that 3.0, when they started working on it, they were like, oh, we&amp;#8217;re going to be merging this thing called multisite.  Actually, before that, in 2.9 they introduced the custom post type API.  And there was another site we were working on that basically used its own really terrible CMS.  It was like a couple of Web forms behind basic HTTPS, super secure.  I though, oh, you know, this whole custom post type thing that they&amp;#8217;re doing in 2.9 would translates really well to this other website that&amp;#8217;s related.  Maybe that would be a good idea.  We didn&amp;#8217;t do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then when 3.0 started they said, oh, we&amp;#8217;re merging in multisite.  And around this time, we had a bunch of budgets cut.  This is like 2008, 2009, so like the whole recession thing, and we had a bunch of budgets that were cut, so we had no software budget.  People had direct FTP access to the website, so we had somebody accidentally delete the homepage of the school site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	And we thought, okay, so this is kind of terrible.  We shouldn&amp;#8217;t maybe use an actual CMS kind of thing.  And we had no budget, so all those traditional, big CMSs are not an option.  So we looked at WordPress because I was like, well, we&amp;#8217;ve been using it really successfully on this other blog, and it seems to do more, and now they&amp;#8217;re merging this multisite thing, which for a university makes a lot of sense.  So you have the home of the university is the home network site, and then each office, department, and a music school studio, so like a teacher&amp;#8217;s area can have their own individual site on the network, and then you can kind of give more granular permissions.  You can be like, hey, so the TA for this person&amp;#8217;s violin studio can have access to that violin studio site, but they can&amp;#8217;t access anything on the main site, so you can get more granular in that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, like they can&amp;#8217;t delete the homepage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right, exactly, and they can&amp;#8217;t even post anything that could possibly appear on the main site, so totally sequestered off.  We thought, hey, that would be a really smart idea, so we started that.  A couple months after we got into planning for it, WordCamp New York 2010 happened, I think, and they had a higher ed track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochester is like a six-hour drive from New York, and I saw it announced the day before it was happening or something, and I thought, oh, my God.  I really probably should go to this thing, so I drove overnight down to New York, crashed with a friend, and went to WordCamp New York, and it was my first ever tech conference, gathering of tech people because, up until then, I had been a musician.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it was amazing, so I got to see people like Boone speak.  I think I saw Nacin speak, a bunch of people, and I thought, you know, this is a really cool vibe, this community.  Most people seem really smart.  They&amp;#8217;re really helpful.  They&amp;#8217;re really opening to talking to this random girl from a music conservatory in Upstate New York.  I really like it, and I think we should stick with it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took us about a year from start to finish.  I was part time at that point, but we launched the site eventually on WordPress.  So that&amp;#8217;s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s amazing.  That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s how I found WordPress and then started maybe developing story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s amazing.  I love hearing people&amp;#8217;s kind of like their origin stories for how they became developers, how they got into WordPress, etc.  And I think it&amp;#8217;s very clear that you have a drive to educate yourself and to learn more about not just the platforms you&amp;#8217;re using, but become more involved with those, which I think is a good segue into what I want to ask you next.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	You started.  You just told us how you got into WordPress.  At what point then &amp;#8212; was it shortly after WordCamp New York or in that next year that you started becoming more and more interested in WordPress Core?  I know that you said that you were kind of paying attention to what was happening, you were following betas, you were following announcements, things like that, but when did you really start diving into WordPress Core itself and trying to contribute back to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Yeah, so it was while I was still at the university, but toward the end of it, we started running our test site on beta.  It was like 3.1 beta probably at that point.  And I was just noticing some little visual quirks here and there, so I was very much a backend developer then.  When I first started that job, I was a PHP and MySQL application developer.  I wrote custom, in-house applications that had to hook to File Maker, which is not my most favorite thing to deal with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	My father is a full-time File Maker developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m very familiar with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  It made sense.  I just didn&amp;#8217;t love it.  Actually, that site has a custom WPDBA connection to the File Maker server for its admissions thing.  It&amp;#8217;s still there, I&amp;#8217;m sure.  I doubt they changed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so I wasn&amp;#8217;t really a front-end developer or anything.  I sometimes don&amp;#8217;t necessarily really think of myself that way.  But I definitely have an eye for details, so I was just noticing these tiny visual quirks.  One day I was like, well, I heard a session at WordCamp like six months ago or whatever about how to contribute or &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t think it was even about how to contribute.  Just somebody mentioned contributing, which is not something I had ever even though of doing.  It never occurred to me because I thought, well, maybe I should figure this whole version thing out and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You&amp;#8217;re jumping in and saying, oh, this is something that maybe I should just learn about, whereas I think a lot of people are much more the mindset of: I&amp;#8217;m going to figure this out once I have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Once I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Honestly, I felt like I needed to because it had become clear to me that version control was a thing.  I didn&amp;#8217;t know.  We were just still FTP-ing everything up at the time, so I didn&amp;#8217;t know what version control is.  I was like it seems like so many people feel really strongly about.  I should probably at least find out why they care so much about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Yeah, so I figured out how to make a patch and submitted it, and Dominik ocean90 reviewed my very first patch and was like, you don&amp;#8217;t have to edit the compressed file.  I was like, what do you mean?  When you look at CSS in Inspector, it tells you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like using the minified files.  So how do you test something that&amp;#8217;s in minified file, but you want the patch to only touch the mon-minified file?  I was like canned editing a minified file?  And, yeah, so I didn&amp;#8217;t know.  What do I know about this stuff?  We weren&amp;#8217;t doing anything like that.  At the time, in Core, it wasn&amp;#8217;t a build tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	It was the committer ran YUI compressor every single time.  So I just didn&amp;#8217;t know.  And he was like, you don&amp;#8217;t need to do that.  And I was like, oh, okay.  I&amp;#8217;m learning.  I don&amp;#8217;t know.  Then with some edits, eventually a patch went in that sort of resembled my original one, and I got props for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Is that first props kind of what drove you to just keep going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Maybe a little bit.  I just &amp;#8212; I like tinkering with things, I think, and I didn&amp;#8217;t like the idea that tiny, little, visual inconsistencies would be there and that I would notice them.  But if I didn&amp;#8217;t say anything, that felt kind of wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  So you&amp;#8217;re the lead on the 4.0 release of WordPress.  How did that come about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  We&amp;#8217;ve been doing the release lead thing since 3.5 when Nacin was the release lead and Koop was the backup lead.  The release lead is a lot of things.  It&amp;#8217;s part technical project manager, right, so where you figure out what kind of resources you need and help people who are stuck and need things.  There&amp;#8217;s a lot of that, and there&amp;#8217;s some development that happens.  There&amp;#8217;s some decision-making.  Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s technical.  Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s not.  In a lot of ways you just need to know enough to be able to make the decision, whether or not you&amp;#8217;re actually technical in terms of what you do day-to-day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	But really, we ask for volunteers.  At the end of 3.8 it was starting out like, hey, so who would like to throw their hat in the ring for 3.9?  And I think the only person who did was me.  And it was sort of thought, okay, so 3.9 has got some good stuff going on, but it would be cooler if maybe you spent this release kind of tracking future plugins and helping out with those and just seeing how they go, and then lead 4.0 instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	And I thought, yeah, that&amp;#8217;s real scary, but sure.  That sounds like a good plan.  Let&amp;#8217;s, you know, I&amp;#8217;ll monitor some future plugins and give feedback and that kind of thing, and then I&amp;#8217;ll lead 4.0, and it&amp;#8217;ll be cool.  That was sort of the discussion that we had during 3.9.  I think it did work out better because, at the time, I have a son and he was really young, like under a year old.  So it was much tougher to put in the kind of funny hours I do sometimes.  I think, overall, it was better that I waited for 4.0 to lead, but basically it was a combination of putting my name out there saying, hey, I&amp;#8217;d be willing to lead 3.9, and then just also being a known person who has earned trust and earned respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it really helps to show that making yourself visible and obviously helping build up a reputation of writing, writing good code, having been a logical, intelligent developer.  But mostly making yourself known is a really good way of, well, I guess, getting higher up and getting better at contributing to Core.  Would you kind of agree with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  Definitely.  I mean it&amp;#8217;s virtual, right?  It&amp;#8217;s virtual and it&amp;#8217;s volunteer, so by nature, the louder you are, and the more noticeable you are, the higher the chances that you&amp;#8217;ll be noticed.  You know, it&amp;#8217;s still best if you have a good attitude and you don&amp;#8217;t say nasty things to contributors, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  Volume alone doesn&amp;#8217;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right.  But &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Just go on Trac and start trolling all the issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right, yeah.  Let&amp;#8217;s not.  Yeah, certainly you can&amp;#8217;t notice somebody who is not noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	And you know that was not easy for me.  I&amp;#8217;m not really the kind of person to be like, hey, pay attention to me.  But at the same time, like I say, it didn&amp;#8217;t feel right that there was a chance to work on the software and I have the privilege and the luxury of being able to work on something in my spare time.  Having that spare time is something really valuable, and I have that.  And I have the ability to contribute to the software.  So if I complain about it, and I don&amp;#8217;t do anything about it, then I&amp;#8217;m kind of horrible if I do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s how I felt about it.  I certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t ever aiming to become a committer.  That was not in my lifetime bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think that&amp;#8217;s probably true with a lot of the people that are on the Core committing team, and not just with WordPress, but open source projects in general.  The people that have, in some way, more of an altruistic about it, and they just want to give back.  And it turns out that through that they get recognized as being really good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, I would agree with that.  It&amp;#8217;s self-selecting your contributors, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	It&amp;#8217;s not super easy to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	That&amp;#8217;s, like, I&amp;#8217;m not going to deny that it&amp;#8217;s not always easy to contribute.  But at the same time, there is an attitude and a tenacity thing that comes with open source and not just WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You have to be willing to step up and say, I think this should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Absolutely, and advocate for what you want, and really follow through on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	With that, what do you think were some of the main challenges?  Also, on the flipside, some of the main highlights of being the release lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I&amp;#8217;ll start with highlights, I guess.  Highlights have been getting to know contributors, and especially ones who I might not otherwise interact with very much because they float around areas where I don&amp;#8217;t really get into as often.  But as release lead, I&amp;#8217;m paying attention to a little bit of everything as opposed to really focusing on one area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Even areas you don&amp;#8217;t necessarily like as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, I mean I think I like most things in Core, but certainly I don&amp;#8217;t typically look at the customizer API, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	And I&amp;#8217;m not making decisions on that necessarily for this release, but working more closely with Nick Halsey&amp;#8211;celloexpressions is his handle, if you&amp;#8217;re more familiar with handles&amp;#8211;and Westin has been really cool because, I think, otherwise I might not have really interacted with them a whole lot, so that&amp;#8217;s been really nice.  It&amp;#8217;s been nice to &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ll be honest, it&amp;#8217;s been nice to feel respected.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really easy to just get in the hole of, okay, I&amp;#8217;m getting stuff done.  I&amp;#8217;m just working.  I&amp;#8217;m just working.  It&amp;#8217;s all good.  I&amp;#8217;m not really paying attention to what else is going on.  But certainly I&amp;#8217;ve felt the support of the community as I&amp;#8217;ve been working through this release.  And the committers, other committers and people that we consider component maintainers have been really amazing this release, just a lot of people putting in a lot of really good work and me feeling like, yeah, I have this group of people that I could be like, you know, that I can rely on and respect me and my decision-making, my opinion, and that kind of thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s been really cool because I think my ride from musician, and I&amp;#8217;m still a musician, but my ride from being a musician most of the time to being a Web developer most of the time has been pretty fast.  And it&amp;#8217;s easy to keep thinking of myself as like, I don&amp;#8217;t want to say a nobody because that&amp;#8217;s not the way that I really think about it, but it&amp;#8217;s really easy to forget that, you know….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s really easy to feel really, really small on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, it is.  Yeah, there are a lot of issues about me particularly being on the Internet, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	It&amp;#8217;s been really nice to feel validated with what I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And any specific challenges that came with the role as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Challenges: I think I expected all of them because I&amp;#8217;ve been through several releases now.  There&amp;#8217;s always a point where you just feel like everything is terrible.  Any project is like this, right?  Client work is the same.  You reach that point toward the end where you&amp;#8217;re like, oh, how am I ever going to get all of this done?  What&amp;#8217;s even going on here?  Everything looks terrible because I&amp;#8217;m looking at it too closely.  You get to that point with everything.  I experience the same thing with client stuff, and that&amp;#8217;s been hard.  I think wrangling volunteers can be very difficult &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	&amp;#8211; because you want to be respectful of the fact that you&amp;#8217;re doing all this stuff based off of people&amp;#8217;s goodwill, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  It&amp;#8217;s volunteer time.  There are only so many demands you can put on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right, exactly.  I can be like, hey, do you think maybe you&amp;#8217;d be interested in helping.  I can&amp;#8217;t be like, just do it, except for with a very small group of people who I know are working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	You know, for some sponsored amount.  And even at that it&amp;#8217;s like, unless it&amp;#8217;s like another Core committer or lead developer, it&amp;#8217;s still at the whims of whoever is sponsoring them, so you have to be respectful.  I think that&amp;#8217;s just been a challenge.  Managing people is always a challenge, trying to schedule out time and make sure that things stay on track, really stay on top of, like, to get reports and what&amp;#8217;s going on.  Making hard decisions to punt tickets, that&amp;#8217;s always unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No one wants to hear their ticket was punted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, sorry about the password thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so those are really hard too because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s hard to be the bearer of bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yes.  It is hard to be the bearer of bad news, and it&amp;#8217;s also, you know, you&amp;#8217;re looking at it and going, yeah, this is totally valid.  We need to fix it, but you have to make a decision at some point, right, because we don&amp;#8217;t do three-year release cycles or whatever.  We do rapid ones, and we do iterative ones.  And with that comes chopping things down because you have to, and that&amp;#8217;s also been tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You mentioned that you pretty much expected the challenges that you faced, but were there any that were kind of unexpected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I don&amp;#8217;t know that there was anything that I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting.  And I think, honestly, that&amp;#8217;s a big part of why I was chosen to be a release lead is that I&amp;#8217;ve been around enough that some of these things that happen don&amp;#8217;t really surprise me.  They still take energy and that kind of thing, but nothing has been out of the ordinary as far as releases go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Of all of the different things that have come in that are going into 4.0 or that have already been finished, two questions for you.  Number one, what is your favorite improvement or change that has gone into 4.0?  And maybe what was your favorite that didn&amp;#8217;t go into 4.0 that was maybe originally slated for 4.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I think when we started 4.0 there was some hope that the WP REST API would go in.  I think we all knew that it was a long shot.  Certainly everybody was hopeful because it sounds cool.  It&amp;#8217;s the future of the Web, and it&amp;#8217;s 4.0 because it&amp;#8217;s a nice round number and all of that kind of thing.  There was some hope, I think, for it.  I&amp;#8217;m glad it didn&amp;#8217;t go in.  When you&amp;#8217;re building an API like that that&amp;#8217;s going to be used at the kind of scale it&amp;#8217;s going to be used at, you have to be really, really deliberate about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You really have to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yes, and I think that what we&amp;#8217;re doing now is we&amp;#8217;re really seeing people build on it and what kinds of pain points come up as people build on it in the real world because that&amp;#8217;s why I can &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s why 10up pays me to work on WordPress is, besides the community thing, it&amp;#8217;s also that I&amp;#8217;m bringing back what we&amp;#8217;ve learned as pain points because we do integration work.  Right?  Every single different use case is going to reveal different pain points.  The more things that get built on the API now before it becomes a slow moving part of Core the better off we&amp;#8217;ll be, right, because once it goes into Core, it can only update with Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	As opposed to being a plugin where it can update as much as it wants to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You could update every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Exactly.  Rapid iteration versus deliberate iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so I think that was nice.  There is a part of me &amp;#8212; I certainly didn&amp;#8217;t do it deliberately, but there is a part of me that is very glad that we don&amp;#8217;t have one giant trumpet feature for this release, and a lot of it is combating that round number bias.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hey, this is version 4.0.  Where is that amazing new feature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  This is WordPress 4.0.  What makes it 4.0?  And it&amp;#8217;s like, well, that&amp;#8217;s not how we number things.  Yeah, you know, if you&amp;#8217;re into version numbers and whatever, like, that is super confusing, and I get that, but we just don&amp;#8217;t things that way.  Honestly, there&amp;#8217;s so many things already in WordPress that iterating on what we&amp;#8217;ve got, to me, is what really defines this as a project, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I 100% agree.  Iterative development and doing releases that are refining existing features is one of my favorite kind of releases.  Definitely, as a developer, I know there&amp;#8217;s times as a user I see a new version and I don&amp;#8217;t see that big, new feature, and I do get into that trap of being like, oh, it could have been more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But then I can take a step back and realize, wait a minute, this little area right here is so much smoother.  For example, the double scroll bars now that are gone from the editor is amazing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I love that feature so much.  I actually knew that it was happening, but then I saw it the other day when I was playing with Trunk, and I was going around.  I was working on some other plugin, and I just noticed it offhand, but it grabbed me because I was like, this is amazing.  And so those little kinds of refinements, they&amp;#8217;re beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There&amp;#8217;s a tumbler called Little Big Details or something like that.  Have you guys ever heard of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  Yeah, I can&amp;#8217;t remember the name.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so they kind of highlight some really cool stuff in apps, so some granular details that are really minor, but important, that add a lot to the user experience.  And I think that&amp;#8217;s kind of what we&amp;#8217;re talking about here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it definitely is.  Those little details, to me, say a lot about how much the developers and the maintainer of a project actually care about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Anybody can build a big, new feature.  Not everybody can polish it so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yep.  Yep, and also &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Actually, it&amp;#8217;s LittleBigDetails.com.  That&amp;#8217;s the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Ah, there we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I recognize that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.  Helen, you are actually paid by 10up to work on Core full time or mostly full time, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	How was &amp;#8212; tell us about that.  Was that a huge contributing factor in becoming the release lead and a factor in how much you&amp;#8217;re able to put into Core?  Obviously you&amp;#8217;re not &amp;#8212; since you&amp;#8217;re paid by 10up to do it, it&amp;#8217;s not as much of I&amp;#8217;m trying to find my time in the evenings or late at night or early in the morning.  So you work on Core most of the day, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yes.  There are a lot of pieces to this.  It&amp;#8217;s not what I started at 10up doing.  Believe it or not, I was the first employee, full-time employee at 10up almost exactly three years ago.  It definitely was not why I started at 10up because I hadn&amp;#8217;t done a whole lot with it before starting at 10up.  For me, it does enable me to do a lot of things that I might not otherwise be able to do now because I have a family.  It enables me to work on it during the day as opposed to during weird hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Although the reality &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Two hours after your son goes to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right.  The reality though is that I work on things at weird hours, and that&amp;#8217;s a part of working with people all across the world, right?  So I do things at really weird times of day still.  So it actually hasn&amp;#8217;t really changed.  It just means that maybe I can take an hour off during the day instead when maybe otherwise you should be working or in a client meeting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I just thought about this because I&amp;#8217;ve got two developers that work with me remotely here in town for the week.  We started getting down to the subject of what do our neighbors think about what we do.  My neighbor is blue-collar worker.  I think he works at a dealership.  He&amp;#8217;ll be going to work in the morning, and I&amp;#8217;m sitting outside in shorts and a t-shirt obviously just woken up, drinking my coffee, and I realize I bet people think that I&amp;#8217;m a bum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that I don&amp;#8217;t do anything.  I think that&amp;#8217;s just an effect of &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just what happens because of the weird hours that we work.  Not necessarily the weird hours, but also the weird circumstances in how we work compared to most people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  Yeah, I think they&amp;#8217;re a little bit confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Do you think that that&amp;#8217;s happening … do you have a hard time explaining or like when people ask what you do or how you&amp;#8217;re working at home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I think, around here, so I live just outside of Manhattan.  Around here I think it&amp;#8217;s more common to find people with less traditional job paths, so I actually don&amp;#8217;t get so many questions about it.  I think what does confuse people though is that my husband is a musician and also is full time, realistically, he&amp;#8217;s the parent.  He&amp;#8217;s a stay at home parent, so we&amp;#8217;re both at home all the time.  I think that&amp;#8217;s confusing for our neighbors is that they always see us during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, my wife and I are the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so they probably think that we don&amp;#8217;t do anything or something.  I think they do know better.  I think Web development is something that&amp;#8217;s pretty well understood.  Well, I guess at least as being a legitimate job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so I don&amp;#8217;t get so many questions about that.  But certainly one of the things that I&amp;#8217;ve been sort of battling a little bit is that when we do go out and meet, you know, meet people or we encounter people around here, there&amp;#8217;s this really subtle way of always asking, you know, because we have a baby, so they always ask my husband what he does, and they never ask me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	So there&amp;#8217;s this assumption that I am a stay at home mom who isn&amp;#8217;t her own person or something, and so that&amp;#8217;s been a little weird.  Yeah, but that&amp;#8217;s really &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, my wife gets the same thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	She&amp;#8217;s been doing her Ph.D., and people just kind of assume that she&amp;#8217;s a stay at home mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s like, oh, you&amp;#8217;re just hanging out at home.  Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s not what I&amp;#8217;m doing at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Making the Internet awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, I make the Internet.  That&amp;#8217;s what I tell people sometimes, and they give you this look of, like, oh, ha-ha, you&amp;#8217;re so funny.  And it&amp;#8217;s like, no.  They&amp;#8217;re like, really?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, no, seriously, I make the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	That&amp;#8217;s actually what I&amp;#8217;m doing.  Yeah, so I get paid to do it, which just means that I&amp;#8217;m more able to not do the client stuff, I guess, is really all it is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I am a director at 10up, so I do some internal leadership.  Some of my community time doesn&amp;#8217;t just go to Core.  I call it community time.  Obviously a lot of it goes into Core, but I also speak at a lot of WordCamps.  I now co-organize a meet-up here in Jersey City, along with Jenn Schiffer.  We co-organize Jersey Script, so that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.  Yeah, I do things like that.  I&amp;#8217;m trying to get out of the WordPress world a little bit, so I&amp;#8217;m trying to speak at events that are not WordPress oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Branching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  I spoke at 200 OK, like a Web development conference in Tulsa last year and that was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What was your motivation for branching out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Branching out &amp;#8212; my personal motivation, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of things.  There&amp;#8217;s obviously self-betterment, just getting better at my craft, meeting people.  I like to spread the word about WordPress.  I think, as we all know, there are a lot of misconceptions about WordPress.  There are also a lot of valid complaints about WordPress.  And I like getting out of our &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Out of our bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	We are.  Yeah.  It is.  I mean, that&amp;#8217;s what I love about the community too, right, is like we are a very positive group for the most part, and such a lovely group of people.  Every time you go to WordCamp, you make new friends.  But at the same time there is a point where not everything is positive, and we&amp;#8217;re not our own best users, right?  So there&amp;#8217;s huge value in getting outside of….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really nice to talk to people that not just are not WordPress users, but also maybe who are no longer WordPress users and find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of, like, this thing burned me and I don&amp;#8217;t want to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	And if we think about the way that we think about things as well, we do the same thing.  It&amp;#8217;s just that we are so invested in WordPress that we forget that, when you get burned by something, you don&amp;#8217;t want to go back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.  I can think of my first experience with a couple of other CMSs, and I could go back and say that didn&amp;#8217;t work out very well, and I have no interest in using them.  And it&amp;#8217;s because I got burned.  Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s been really nice.  Obviously for 10up, it&amp;#8217;s great for recruiting.  It&amp;#8217;s great for getting our name out there.  When we pitch to clients and that kind of thing, they love that we have demonstrated deep knowledge of WordPress, that it&amp;#8217;s publicly visible and that you have that kind of expertise on the team.  Being in this area in New York, I meet up with clients fairly regularly, both for new sales and also for just continued strategy and that kind of thing.  And I do enjoy doing that as well because I love 10up as well as I love WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah, so I love doing those things for the company as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If someone is listening that is interested in getting involved, contributing to Core, what would you tell them or what would you say to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I would say to scratch your itch &amp;#8212; we say that all the time.  It sounds kind of corny, but it does require some tenacity to contribute, right, because depending on where we are in the dev cycle, we might not be able to commit that thing that you worked on so hard right now.  Right now, a lot of people are like, hey, can you commit this thing?  I made a patch.  It&amp;#8217;s like, sorry, no enhancements right now.  Sometimes you have to wait, right?  And sometimes tickets, they don&amp;#8217;t get noticed because WordPress is a very busy project, which is nice and healthy, but also is just a lot of information parts all the time.  Either sometimes tickets get lost, so you have to be willing to come and be like, hey, can somebody please pay attention?  Hey, where are we with this?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Don&amp;#8217;t you have to be willing to speak up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yes.  You have to be willing to speak up and willing to wait a little bit sometimes and understand the dev cycle, which is like self-learning.  I think, when you have something you&amp;#8217;re working on that is really meaningful to you, as opposed to just looking to work on something because you&amp;#8217;re looking for a quick props, I think there&amp;#8217;s more success in those just because, when you&amp;#8217;re invested in it, it&amp;#8217;s easy to stick with it.  Of course, if you&amp;#8217;re comfortable with something like a bug tracker, then you can look through Trac and be like, hey, I see this is slated for 4.0.  It needs a patch, and I should work on it.  But you&amp;#8217;re not born knowing how to use Trac, so it&amp;#8217;s not always a great place to start.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Yeah, I think looking for something that you&amp;#8217;re into, so like for me, my first patch was some stars had the wrong colored border.  It sounds really small, but that&amp;#8217;s something that I noticed and was bugging me, so I wanted to work on it, right?  It wasn&amp;#8217;t like, oh, this is already, you know, this is guaranteed to get into this release.  That&amp;#8217;s sort of a funny motivation.  It&amp;#8217;s not bad.  It&amp;#8217;s just not the way that we operate the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it&amp;#8217;s very easy for people to come in and kind of have a misconception that says, okay, I found this issue, whether it&amp;#8217;s an enhancement or a bug.  I wrote a patch.  The patch seems to work, so it&amp;#8217;ll just obviously go right in.  Well, right, duh?  No.  And people have that misconception, but that&amp;#8217;s just not quite the way that it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I learned that the hard way for sure.  I remember a couple of my first patches.  I put them in, and they sat there for months.  I was like, why is no one looking at this?  But then once I spoke up and kind of asked, I got that process.  It was made more clear to me.  People explained it, and I think that helped a lot.  But it was really that speaking up and trying to figure out not just about getting noticed, but saying, hey, here is this; I would love to know what someone thinks about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Mm-hmm, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	As opposed to just assuming that someone will see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I think it touches on a really interesting thing that we&amp;#8217;ve been working on in terms of Core project management, which is that you&amp;#8217;re right.  I think a lot of people do submit patches and assume they&amp;#8217;re going to be reviewed or at least looked at, right?  I don&amp;#8217;t think that&amp;#8217;s an unfair assumption.  But I don&amp;#8217;t think that we&amp;#8217;re equipped to do it because it&amp;#8217;s such a large project, right?  And it&amp;#8217;s a high volume of stuff that&amp;#8217;s coming in all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	What we&amp;#8217;re working on, and mostly through Nacin, working on things on the .org side, but so there are components, right?  Trac has  a field for components, and we think of components as this functional piece of WordPress, right?  So like the customizer is a functional piece of WordPress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	What we want to do is find people who become then the maintainers of that component that&amp;#8217;s not a committer.  Being a committer, honestly, is not really all that glamorous.  It&amp;#8217;s not about becoming committer.  It&amp;#8217;s about saying I have, through whatever means, developed this expertise in this area of WordPress, in this functional component of WordPress.  I, therefore, feel empowered to understand not only how this component works now, but have a vision for how it could work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right, and how we maintain that compatibility, where it could go, what awesome things it could be, how it&amp;#8217;s going to work on different devices, whatever, all kinds of aspects of whatever component.  And we want people who have developed that deep knowledge in whatever means to come and say, like, I am a part of maintaining this component.  That person then is empowered by way of trust, essentially, right?  Hey, I&amp;#8217;m a &amp;#8212; they&amp;#8217;re listed on the page as a component maintainer.  For the customizer, we have Westin, Nick and, I believe, Dominik listed as maintainers of this component.  You can subscribe to a component if you just want to check it out, so there&amp;#8217;s that aspect to it as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think that right there, being able to subscribe to individual components, is one of the biggest things that I&amp;#8217;ve found personally that made it a lot easier.  Just being able to see what&amp;#8217;s happening in a particular part of Core that I care about, maybe more so than other parts, and just seeing those tickets come through, seeing that discussion and being like, oh, I could jump in here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yep.  Yeah, and that&amp;#8217;s the other thing is like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It really helps cut through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	It does.  Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of noise, and I think also with that then that&amp;#8217;s a way to develop that kind of expertise in that component over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Just by watching what happens in Core, learning what other parts of Core maybe you do have to consider, and then &amp;#8212; so, like, in an ideal world, right, we have a component maintainer who may or may not have commit access.  It&amp;#8217;s sort of beyond the point because commit access for us is just a formality of pushing code … version, so a component maintainer should be able to see the tickets as they come into their component and give quicker feedback than waiting for one of 10 to 13 committers to come review it.  So there can be a much larger body of component maintainers.  As a new ticket comes in, they can kind of give it an overview.  If there&amp;#8217;s a patch, they can review the patch, give feedback on it, give feedback on the ticket, maybe close it out immediately, which is also super helpful so that we just don&amp;#8217;t have so many things open all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	It&amp;#8217;s great to have open tickets, especially because we track features and wish list items too.  But just cut out the noise, right?  We don&amp;#8217;t need this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	We can close this and do….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Make it easier to find things.  Make it easier to keep track of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right, exactly.  And also to define future roadmaps for that component and that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	And so ideally these people, they would be able to review a patch and say, hey, this is really for commit.  I think this is awesome.  Then all a committer has to do now is do a final review and hopefully commit it.  It goes much faster.  Pippin, you at the WordCamp New York contributor day, reviewed a patch that&amp;#8217;s actually been in my court for like months.  But because it hadn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; it had some people look at the patch and say, oh, hey, it works, which is also really helpful, but I don&amp;#8217;t think anybody had really done much of a patch review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	But I felt like, okay, so I know Pippin.  Not just because I&amp;#8217;ve met him or something, but I know him, what he&amp;#8217;s worked on, and stuff he&amp;#8217;s done in Trac.  I feel pretty confident that he&amp;#8217;s looked at this patch, and it seems good to him, and I still have a question about this patch now having looked at it, but now I know that there is a person that I can communicate with and ask this one last question of before I go commit it.  Right?  Instead of me having to do the initial review, leave feedback, wait for a response to the feedback, and then maybe commit it.  Right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	That&amp;#8217;s a lot more time and energy than just doing a last cursory review of something before committing it.  And so that finally went in, not just because it was slated for 4.0, but because somebody who wasn&amp;#8217;t a committer &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because somebody else looked at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And helped give that extra feedback.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Exactly.  Somebody kicked it and was like, hey, here&amp;#8217;s one less step that a committer has to take in order for this to come to Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s definitely lots sitting around in Core that can have that, so for anybody who is listening, if you&amp;#8217;re having trouble getting active, I think that&amp;#8217;s a really great way to go ahead and get involved is go find those ones that have been sitting around and need that extra kick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I know we could go on probably for hours talking about Core.  Unfortunately, I think we are getting about out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Helen, thank you so much for coming on.  It&amp;#8217;s been an absolute pleasure.  Quickly, tell people where they can find you online for any questions that they may have if they want to get in touch or just look up what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Sure.  I am @helenhousandi on Twitter.  I&amp;#8217;m fairly active there.  I&amp;#8217;m just Helen in freenode in IRC if you want to come find me for WordPress development things.  We hold daily bug scrubs right now at 11:00 a.m. eastern.  So if you want to just see how that works, you can come check that out.  You don&amp;#8217;t have to say anything.  You can just sit there in the WordPress dev channel and watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absorb knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Yeah.  Just see how it works.  It really is not a scary glamorous thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	I&amp;#8217;m HelenHoSandi.com if you want to see what I do, and 10up.com is our lovely company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.  Thank you so much, Helen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELEN:	Of course.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.  I just wanted to mention Big Snow Tiny Conf.  It&amp;#8217;s the ski getaway and conference for business owners.  So if you have a business, and you would like to do some skiing, snowboarding, and talk business, come join us at Sugarbush Mountain in Vermont January 26th to the 29th.  BigSnowTinyConf.com for the details and to subscribe to our mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Also, you should head on over to iTunes.  Leave us a review.  That would be awesome.  It not only helps us, but it also helps people find our podcast, so we&amp;#8217;d really appreciate that.  &lt;/p&gt;

INTRO:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

PIPPIN:	Welcome to todays episode for number 23.  Today we have a special guest, Helen Hou-Sandi.  She is the WordPress 4.0 Core lead.  That means shes leading the development of WordPress 4.0.

	Helen, do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?  Say hello and tell us what you do.

HELEN:	Hi.  So Im Helen, and Im the Director of Platform Experience at 10up, a really awesome Web agency that focuses on publishing experiences and doing really cool things for clients.  And Im also a WordPress Core committer and the 4.0 release lead, and thats, for the most part, what Ive been doing with my time recently.  

PIPPIN:	Awesome.  

BRAD:	Helen, when did you get started with WordPress?

HELEN:	Oh, man.  So I started with WordPress as a user.  I used Blogger when I was in high school, I guess, so 2002, 2001, that kind of area.  And I ended up going to college for music, and didnt really blog or really do much on the Internet anymore.  I then went to grad school, that kind of thing, and realized, hey, Im probably needing to become a professional musician, and I should probably have a website because thats what people do these days is look people up on the Internet and MySpace.  

People would be like, oh, why dont you use MySpace?  They do band pages.  Its like, I play classical piano. It seems really weird, so I should probably learn about making my own website.  

And I looked at Blogger because I was like this is familiar to me.  But, at the time, Blogger didnt do pages.  They just did posts.  And somebody I knew who runs a blog on Blogger was like, well, have you ever looked at WordPress.  Im curious what you think of WordPress.  And I was like, I dont know.  No, I havent, but Ill try this since I need to make a website.  

I ended up making a static website because I didnt know how to make my own theme in WordPress or anything like that, but I did start a blog using WordPress.

PIPPIN:	So you had static pages and then one page was the blog that was WordPress?

HELEN:	I think it was installed on a sub-domain or something.  I think it was totally separate.  They werent related.  It was more like I thought maybe I could use something for my website, a</itunes:summary>

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now here&amp;#8217;s your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes, I am Brad Touesnard and joining me, as usual, is my cohost Pippin Williamson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hello, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And this is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Welcome to Episode 22. As usual, we have our sponsors from WP Ninjas with Ninja Forms. If you haven&amp;#8217;t checked them out, go take a look at NinjaForms.com, as well as their NinjaDemo.com. And also joining us is Mr. Zack Katz. Do you want to say hello, Zack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Hey, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Why don&amp;#8217;t we &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s an awesome name: Zack Katz. That&amp;#8217;s a great name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It is pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: It sets me up for stardom, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I mean my name is so not brandable it&amp;#8217;s not even funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, it&amp;#8217;s the silent D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it gets you every time, that silent D. Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, it took me months to figure out how to pronounce your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I know. I don&amp;#8217;t even think I pronounce it right half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Laughter]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice. Zack, why don&amp;#8217;t we get started by having you tell us a little bit about yourself? What do you do? How long have you been working in WordPress, things like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, I&amp;#8217;ve been working in WordPress since about 2006 or 2007, and I started with client work and kind of slowly transitioned into doing plugin development and then started with plugin development for myself and for clients, and now it&amp;#8217;s my sole business. It&amp;#8217;s plugin developments and sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome. Now are you still &amp;#8212; you said you started with freelance. Was that primarily like theme development for clients, just the generic build a site for them and do everything like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the way I got into plugins was, I think, the way a lot of people do is the client had a need, and there was no functionality out there for what they wanted to do, so I coded what needed to be coded. And I realized, oh, well, if I put this on the repo, other people can benefit from the work that I&amp;#8217;ve done. And it&amp;#8217;s really &amp;#8212; it just caught on and I got really excited about being able to share the improvements that I&amp;#8217;ve been able to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. So when was &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s exactly how I got started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Oh, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: When was the first plugin that you put on .org?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: It was, I think &amp;#8212; I had just looked at this the other day &amp;#8212; like 2006. It was three lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: 2006 is like old school though, man. That&amp;#8217;s a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah. I was surprised myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, most people didn&amp;#8217;t even start with WordPress until &amp;#8212; like most people say 2008, right? Like it&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I think I started 2.5 was my first major update that I remember. I think I started at like 2.3, so maybe I&amp;#8217;m wrong about the date, but it was a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I started in 2.8, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, 2.8 was a major one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, so you&amp;#8217;re quite a ways ahead of me. That&amp;#8217;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome. So you&amp;#8217;ve been doing this for a while now. So now that you mentioned that you&amp;#8217;ve transitioned into doing plugin development full time, are you primarily doing like custom plugin development for clients still, or have you transitioned into more like commercial plugin development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I&amp;#8217;m only developing plugins and features and enhancements that I control at this point, so with repos that I manage, things like that because I got tired of doing one-offs and not being able to continue to grow the project or continue to benefit from the work that I had put into it. So I made a conscious decision five years ago to start transitioning into projects that will help my career, not just pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah. And, you know, the thing is it actually worked. That&amp;#8217;s the surprising part is that WordPress is such a great community and people are so hungry for plugins and, you know, things to make their site work better, and it&amp;#8217;s running so much of the Internet that the community is so vibrant that it&amp;#8217;s allowed so many people to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s great. I&amp;#8217;m looking at your site, and I see you have a couple of commercial plugins listed on your site, and I know you have another one coming up really soon that we want to talk about here in a little bit. What are the &amp;#8212; so right now all of the plugin development work that you&amp;#8217;re doing in terms of from the business side of things is working with existing plugins and doing commercial plugins. Do you do a lot of custom development for clients based on your plugins? For example, you have the Gravity Forms Directory plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you find that a lot of the work that you&amp;#8217;re doing is doing development on that that users have requested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: You know, one of the things that I&amp;#8217;ve done recently that&amp;#8217;s been really huge for me is partnering with a development in Portugal. His name is Luis. And he&amp;#8217;s been so great to work with, and it&amp;#8217;s allowed me to have a support team where people, if they need enhancements to an existing plugin, I refer that request to Luis. He puts together a quote. The enhancement gets created, and I pull it back into the plugin, and then push it to everybody. So it&amp;#8217;s a really nice system because the people who need it pay for it. The people who &amp;#8212; and the whole community benefits from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Certainly. Brad, do you do that as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Take like user requested features, either on a free or a commercial plugin, and then treat it almost like a client or a contract project where you build that feature for them, but then push that back to the primary plugin so that everybody else gets to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I did do that recently, actually. Well, not that recently. I guess it&amp;#8217;s been almost a year now, but my Amazon plugin, someone needed some work done for it, and they were just like, how about I pay you to do it? And that&amp;#8217;s what happened. And then I just released, you know, the version 1 or 0.59 or whatever it was, you know. So, yeah, that was great. It&amp;#8217;s basically a sponsored development, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Definitely. I really like that. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you&amp;#8217;d call it a model. But acknowledging that just because you have a free plugin, and in this case it could be free or commercial, but you can still have sponsored development on it and then release those features or improvements out to the world. And as long as that&amp;#8217;s communicated clearly with the person that&amp;#8217;s paying for that development, and everybody is fine with it, it really benefits everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: It does, and they get the benefit from the ongoing support that that feature will have because it&amp;#8217;s now part of the core plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Instead of having to maintain the compatibility in the future, it&amp;#8217;s now on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve had features where I built them for somebody custom, but they didn&amp;#8217;t go into the primary plugin, and then it actually became problematic because, later on, when I built new features that did go to the main plugin, they realized, oh, we can&amp;#8217;t use these anymore. And that definitely becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right, so a lot of my plugins have been going on that model in terms of like my Gravity Forms Infusion Soft plugin was actually sponsored by somebody to develop it because they wanted an infusion Soft integration. Salesforce plugin has had a bunch of improvements because people have needed X, Y, or Z. And, you know, everybody enjoys getting those free updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s excellent. I mean it makes so much sense to me because, I mean, developers don&amp;#8217;t have time to spend. If they&amp;#8217;re freelancing or whatever, they don&amp;#8217;t really have time to spend developing feature requests that people have, even though they might be good for everyone, right? They will probably get to them eventually, right? Like I know personally it can take me a year before I get to building something that I&amp;#8217;ve had in my head for a while, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I actually have an active ticket on one of my EDD extensions right now that people have been requesting for a year, maybe even a year and a half, and I&amp;#8217;ve written part of it, but it&amp;#8217;s simply finding that time to actually sit down and really work that feature out and build it can be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And that&amp;#8217;s the same with both a free or a paid plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re a freelancer, your time is prioritized by what&amp;#8217;s bringing money in, basically, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And so if someone can sponsor that feature, it really bumps it up in the priority, right? You know, it bumps it up from a year down the road to like, you know, three, four weeks down the road, which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, and especially if the scope of the modification is outside of, I like to call it, productive procrastination. If I take half a day, and I make a new plugin, then that will likely get done way sooner than if it takes multiple days of concerted effort to push out a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: For sure. So Zack, you&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of plugins going here. How do you manage them all? Do you have people that, you know, contractors or how do you &amp;#8212; or is it just you? What&amp;#8217;s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: You know at this point I&amp;#8217;m about to sunset a lot of them and put them up for adoption. Some of them just haven&amp;#8217;t been maintained in a while, so those ones I just haven&amp;#8217;t been focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: The Gravity Forms integrations are some of my most popular ones that I&amp;#8217;m going to be definitely continuing to update those. And it&amp;#8217;s really the &amp;#8212; if something serious is happening, then I try to fix it. And if people contact me through my premium support form, then I focus on those requests first. You know, I&amp;#8217;ve got so many plugins out there, and I have a lot of them on GitHub, and so I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to get more community support around that, but it&amp;#8217;s not really developed yet. So I need to do a better job of communicating that that is out there for other developers to help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Do you find that there&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8212; do you find there&amp;#8217;s like a weight on your shoulders or &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah. You know, it&amp;#8217;s hard to visit the support forums now because there are so many tickets that I haven&amp;#8217;t addressed. And, you know, that&amp;#8217;s where premium plugins really are so much better is because you know you have &amp;#8212; you know exactly what your responsibilities are. You have a limited number of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And they are not users. And I know that people don&amp;#8217;t like to call WordPress plugin users &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221;, but customers does have a different meaning. You&amp;#8217;ve purchased something. You&amp;#8217;ve paid for it. You have expectations. And so it&amp;#8217;s really the premium model, even if it&amp;#8217;s premium support, I think is the biggest innovation in WordPress since its launch. It&amp;#8217;s really enabling WordPress to mature as a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I think it&amp;#8217;s very clear that that&amp;#8217;s happening, that maturation, a lot. But just looking at the number of businesses that have come up around the idea of providing support, and providing support not just for their own products but thinking of dedicated support for your entire WordPress site in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right. Well, and then there was the project by Alex King. I think he was behind the WP Help Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Where they would support any plugins come to them with any issues, and they folded stat. It didn&amp;#8217;t work because plugins are complex. The code varies dramatically. And it&amp;#8217;s a hard thing to support a plugin if you didn&amp;#8217;t write it, and it takes time to get to know a code base. So, you know, there are different hosting platforms that only support certain plugins because they&amp;#8217;ve audited them. They know about them. And it&amp;#8217;s going to be interesting how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Someone else is trying that again, that whole idea of supporting plugins and themes. They&amp;#8217;re doing everything. I can&amp;#8217;t remember the name of it. I came across it a couple weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I think I saw that as well. It is an interesting &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, I hope it works. I hope it works, and I hope they contribute to the GitHub repos if they find issues, even though it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;d be super, super surprised if it worked for the reasons you just mentioned. I mean it&amp;#8217;s extremely difficult to manage, to provide support for someone else&amp;#8217;s code and product that is, you know, continuously evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, super difficult. I think in order for someone to do really well and to provide that kind of support, they would have to be an active member of those communities. For example, if somebody wanted to come in and provide third party support for Easy Digital Downloads, they would need to be active in the EDD development community as a user, etc. because they need to be constantly involved with things that are changing, involved in terms of getting to know new things that are coming out, whether they be extensions or features or changes to APIs, whatever they are. If you&amp;#8217;re really going to try and do this, especially with large plugins, you have to be familiar with them on an intimate level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Especially because once people start paying for support, they&amp;#8217;re going to start coming to you with the really hard issues, not the, hey, can you tweak my CSS for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right, and then it&amp;#8217;s like, well, can you pay me for ten hours of support just to look into this for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: No, they want it fixed in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And I mean there are lots of companies out there that are doing kind of like customizations and stuff. And those seem to be &amp;#8212; like, or I don&amp;#8217;t know &amp;#8212; from a distance, they seem to be doing really well. I can&amp;#8217;t even think of one off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: WorkPress would be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, WorkPress. They do themes, right, like customizations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and there are a few others, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, and they seem to do very well for themselves. Just as like somebody who is running a plugin shop, we get a ton of requests for modifications. And originally I set it up like I would try and take a bunch of them before &amp;#8212; we now set it up so that we have a list of consultants that we send &amp;#8212; that we just tell people to contact if they have customizations that they want regardless of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We have a general form that people can fill out, and then that goes to all the different consultants. And it&amp;#8217;s kind of cool because it&amp;#8217;s actually turned into some pretty good work for some of those consultants because of the number of requests that go through it. So there is definitely a market for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: So, Pippin, you&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8212; Brad, I don&amp;#8217;t know if you&amp;#8217;re on the Core team or not, but one of the things that I keep on running into recently is the need for some Core logging system where any plugin can use, you know, can hook into the logging action and just log something that is available to users under maybe the tools menu instead of having to build the logging systems time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Is that even being talked about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t think so. I&amp;#8217;ve never seen any of it, at least not in my own involvement and track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I did &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Pippin, you have something, right? You have a class or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I built a class called WP Logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m using that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, nice. It&amp;#8217;s okay. I mean, it could be a lot better. It was kind of a quick and dirty solution, but that works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So, Zack, out of all of the plugins that you have on WordPress.org or elsewhere if you have other plugins that you host, what would you say your favorite plugins are? I know you said you&amp;#8217;re getting ready to discontinue quite a few of them. Are you trying to narrow your focus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, there are things like lottery results plugin. You know, one of the reasons I built so many plugins so early was honestly affiliate marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And that, you know, WordPress is such a big platform that I got into building some plugins that I found some synergies with. Like I built a lot of newsletter plugins and, you know, there are some like lottery results that don&amp;#8217;t need to be around. I don&amp;#8217;t need to be managing them. They don&amp;#8217;t need to be on my list of plugins that I&amp;#8217;m maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in terms of my favorite plugins, I really like how simple &amp;#8212; and I&amp;#8217;m kind of surprised I&amp;#8217;m saying this &amp;#8212; my user groups plugin is. It allows you to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I was just looking at that plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah. It allows you to group users and, you know, assign the user group a color. I took a lot of time and paid a lot of attention to how the interface works, and I really enjoyed making that one. That was kind of a sub-project of my IDX Plus real estate plugin, and I&amp;#8217;ve forked it often and made it its own standalone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s a cool, little plugin, so basically you&amp;#8217;re giving users &amp;#8212; you&amp;#8217;re assigning them a taxonomy term, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And making it so that you can group them and so you could, just as like a quick example, we could have users that are in a customers group and users that are the employees group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And other plugins do a lot more with that, like you can handle them differently. You can assign them different price structures in EDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: There&amp;#8217;s a lot more you can do with other plugins, but in terms of just a cute, little plugin, I think that&amp;#8217;s one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, and it has nothing to do with capabilities or anything like that. It&amp;#8217;s just purely for kind of sorting and then maybe like displaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, just being able to organize them and know who you&amp;#8217;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s awesome. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, so you have done a lot of work with Gravity Forms, and that&amp;#8217;s very clear for anybody who goes and looks at your profile. I mean you have somewhere between five and ten add-ons for Gravity Forms. And I know that you are getting ready to release a new plugin that is an improvement, at least tell me if I get this wrong, but basically a significant step up from your Gravity Forms Directory plugin, and this is something that, if I remember right, you&amp;#8217;re hoping to launch today. Do you want to tell us about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, GravityView, it&amp;#8217;s called, at GravityView.co, and it&amp;#8217;s going live at 4:00 p.m., so under three hours from now. And the Gravity Forms Directory plugin started off really small, and it was never really intended to be as feature rich as it is right now. And it started off without fully understanding the uses that it would be put to and the needs of the people who are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided a couple years ago that I wanted to completely rewrite it, and I got started in October of last year. I brought on Luis in December, and we&amp;#8217;ve been working full tilt on it since then and, you know, we&amp;#8217;ve been paying a lot of attention to making this as easy as possible to display your Gravity Forms entries in table format, in a listing format, kind of like Yelp where you have a profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And then in data tables format for ajax table filtering and sorting. So we&amp;#8217;ve put a lot of work into it, and I&amp;#8217;m kind of getting ADD at this point in terms of trying to make all the interface things just right. But it&amp;#8217;s good to have a deadline for launch because otherwise I&amp;#8217;d be continuing to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, otherwise you&amp;#8217;d just keep finding &amp;#8212; oh, I need to fix this or I need to improve this or add this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So it&amp;#8217;s really, to put it overly simple, to overly simplify it, it&amp;#8217;s basically a way to take all of the data that&amp;#8217;s submitted through your Gravity Forms, whatever that data is, and then display it on the front end of your site. So if you have people submitting their own profiles to your site, you can then display a directory of those profiles. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, and one of the great things about developing it was kind of coming up with a preset idea, the idea of having some preset templates where you click one button and it builds the Gravity Form for you. And it fills in where the fields should go in the layout automatically. So that was a really cool functionality that I think was integral to the whole plugin and making it really easy. Instead of having to drag and drop every field all the time, you can just click a button and get started with, you know, I think we have eight or ten different presets right now. So that was a really exciting thing that we added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I played with it the other day when you sent me a beta copy of it, and I&amp;#8217;ll have to agree with exactly what you just said that those presets were amazing. For one, because I immediately jumped in, and I didn&amp;#8217;t really know what I was getting myself into just kind of beta testing it. And then those preset templates immediately said, oh, well, here&amp;#8217;s how you would do this or here&amp;#8217;s how you do this. Let us help walk you through this. That was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly. Well, and the &amp;#8212; you know, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of complexity in the plugin, and trying to make complex plugins simple is a big job and Luis has helped me with that and, you know, I always look to Apple&amp;#8217;s design principles are trying to make things simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: As little design as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes. I will say the plugin is a really pretty on the admin side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s for sure. What are your plans for the plugin? You&amp;#8217;re launching later today. This is going to be a commercial plugin, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And is this your primary focus right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, it is. I&amp;#8217;m going to be going &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m going to be continuing to develop full tilt for it for a while. We&amp;#8217;ve got a long list of really cool extensions and different views like a map view for being able to display all the entries in a map layout. Each of these features is going to require a lot of work for developing like our own Gravity Forms button that adds a map functionality that we feel like is easy for the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Is that like the ability to have a map that then displays pins for each of the submissions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: So there is currently a geo-tagging plugin for Gravity Forms, but we might have to roll our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Can we go through the full kind of flow of your plugin to kind of give people an idea of how it would be used? To start, would they be starting with no Gravity Form whatsoever? Is that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: That&amp;#8217;s a possibility, yeah. There are two options. There&amp;#8217;s a start fresh button where you click the start fresh button. You&amp;#8217;re provided with a list of presets, and you can use any of those presets, and they are things like event listings or resume view or a business view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. What if I choose resume, for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: You click resume, and then the configuration metabox appears where it shows you where all the fields are laid out, including the &amp;#8212; it has the title. It has multiple entries view and a single entries view, so you can configure how the fields are arranged in either view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, so at this point you&amp;#8217;re setting up the form for the front end for people to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right, but you don&amp;#8217;t know that you&amp;#8217;re setting up the form. You&amp;#8217;re just configuring what you want it to look like, and then you click save or publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And then in the back end the form is created for you. Then all you need to do is add entries to your new Gravity Forms form. But then there&amp;#8217;s the other option where, if you already have a Gravity Forms form, and you want to display the entries, you select that form from a dropdown, and then you configure the fields as you want, but there&amp;#8217;s no preset layout for that because we aren&amp;#8217;t able to know what your form entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. And so in terms of &amp;#8212; so how do you control the display of this? Is it like can developers tweak the CSS and create their own templates or how does that work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, we use &amp;#8212; and I don&amp;#8217;t know how to pronounce this, but Gamajo template loader where &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s from Gary Jones, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, exactly. And so we use that so that people can override how individual field types are displayed. For example, if you want to change how a file upload field is, you just overwrite the template in your own theme folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Ah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: But then there are tons of hooks. There are presets that are also an extendable class, so you can add your own presets if you want. And you can hook in, in a lot of different places, to modify a bunch of different stuff. And yeah, all the presets &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s designed to be extendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s really pretty. I&amp;#8217;m not going to lie. After having played with the plugin, played with the admin UI, played with the front end, looked at the code, I like it a lot. I&amp;#8217;m really excited for it and I hope your launch goes really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Are you able to share with us any information about what the price of the plugin is going to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah. One second. Let me pull it up. I don&amp;#8217;t want to get it wrong on the air. So I went back and forth on a lot of different pricing structures, but the single site $39, and multi-site/three sites $99. That includes some additional premium extensions. And a 100-site license is $239, and that includes premium views such as the map view when that&amp;#8217;s developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Very cool, so you&amp;#8217;re going to have these extensions as well, and you mentioned &amp;#8212; I heard you say premium extensions. Are you going to be selling the extensions one-off as well, or are they only for people that hold the higher tiers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Only for people that hold the higher tiers. That way it&amp;#8217;s just simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And what are some examples of those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, we&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of different things in our GitHub issues list. Some of them are ratings and reviews for the entries. So if you wanted to have a Yelp like system where businesses get reviewed, that would enable that. Featured entries where people could pay to have their entries always show up at the top of the results with granular controls. Advanced filtering and sorting, capabilities to show, have conditional functionality where I only want the view to show if it&amp;#8217;s in this category, the entry has this term in it or the entry has this value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: So those are just a few. We&amp;#8217;ve got a ton of big ideas though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And never enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So I know there&amp;#8217;s probably developers out there listening to this, maybe, maybe I think three, I think that&amp;#8217;s how many. Yeah. They might be asking what, like why would I use this. I&amp;#8217;ve got Gravity Forms. I can code up my templates how I usually do. I&amp;#8217;m comfortable with that. What&amp;#8217;s the sales pitch here? What are the big advantages to using this over kind of cowboy coding it yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, if you want to cowboy code it, look at my Gravity Forms Directory add-on and know what that leads to. You know, the Gravity Forms &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Not credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Gravity Forms has made huge strides with their new API class. It makes it a lot easier to fetch all the data that you need. So it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to cowboy code what you need, but it&amp;#8217;s still your clients aren&amp;#8217;t going to have the ability to drag and drop where they want the stuff to be laid out. You aren&amp;#8217;t going to have presets. GravityView is designed to be as simple and powerful as possible to get your entries on the front end of your site and to also make it easier for your clients to maintain that. So I think that&amp;#8217;s the main selling point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Should we move on to business talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, let&amp;#8217;s talk a little business here. And this goes right into your launching of GravityView, so you have chosen, I guess &amp;#8212; I mean this is going to be a commercial plugin. It&amp;#8217;s very much a premium model, but it&amp;#8217;s also based on a free plugin, so you have a little bit of the freemium model going on here as well. Basically you have that free version and then you have this significant upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understand that it is a different plugin, but do you envision this upgrade path here, and what made you really decide? What made you choose the pricing model that you did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of pressure to be free. And I really feel that, and I feel like I owe it to the community to make it free. But in terms of what&amp;#8217;s best for the product and what&amp;#8217;s best for the people who purchase and use the product, that&amp;#8217;s just not possible for a lot of different reasons. But mainly it&amp;#8217;s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s been a lot written on this. You know, Tom McFarland has been doing a lot of writing on freemium and premium and just what expectations are for developers and for the users of the plugins. It just made it clearer the relationship between us and them, you know, the customers and the developers, and it allows us to grow faster. Even if fewer people are using the plugin, it allows us to reinvest in the plugin at a bigger rate than just providing support for a lot of people who have issues on the free side. So I think that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: That&amp;#8217;s my main driver in the way I&amp;#8217;ve priced it is what&amp;#8217;s best for the product moving forward, not what&amp;#8217;s best for me. Unfortunately, what&amp;#8217;s best for the public at large sometimes free isn&amp;#8217;t best for them, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I think what a lot of people fail to realize when you look at it as a free product, it&amp;#8217;s going back to that, the amount of responsibility and the amount of time that you can dedicate to a product when it&amp;#8217;s free and when there is only so much return for you. I mean there may be huge return in terms of the emotional rewards and the ego that you get knowing that 100,000 people use your free plugin and that it&amp;#8217;s awesome. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t pay your rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Ego doesn&amp;#8217;t go so far when you&amp;#8217;re living in a cardboard box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Ego does not pay your mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Though it also, the ego gets destroyed when people get mad at you for not providing immediate support &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: &amp;#8212; for a ticket that had been posted at 2:00 a.m. in the morning on a free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I think it&amp;#8217;s very easy for people to get….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think we all know that if you develop a plugin and put it on .org, you owe them a response within five minutes no matter what time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think anybody who has had a plugin that has any larger number of downloads has definitely experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And it&amp;#8217;s interesting, but I think a lot of people get caught up on not fully understanding the &amp;#8212; it can be &amp;#8212; it can actually be better for the users of a product to have it be a commercial plugin as opposed to a free one, and it&amp;#8217;s better because they&amp;#8217;ve paid for it, because suddenly you as a developer or the team behind it not only have a responsibility to work to improve issues on it, to make it better, to fix bugs, etc. and to support any questions you have, but they also have a more vested interest in doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that if I spend more time working on EDD or Affiliate WP or Restrict Content Pro this month, that will likely boost the number of sales that I get, or it will boost what people think of the product, which then makes them talk about it more to other people. And so it can be better for the users to pay for it because of the developer then having that vested interest in improving it, whereas if you have something that&amp;#8217;s free, they don&amp;#8217;t have &amp;#8212; they want to stroke their own ego by making it better and better, but that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I really like the freemium model. That&amp;#8217;s what we do with Migrate DB Pro. And I can tell you right now the benefits to the free plugin are enormous when you have a successful commercial plugin that&amp;#8217;s an upgrade. And we&amp;#8217;re going to prove that really soon by releasing a brand new version of the free plugin with a huge revamp, so it&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot better than it is right now. I mean we&amp;#8217;re not going to roll all the pro features in or anything crazy like that, but it&amp;#8217;s going to be much more refined than it currently is, and it&amp;#8217;s going to work in a lot more hosting configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that it&amp;#8217;s going to be a big change is that we&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8212; so what happened is when we started developing the pro version, the code bases completely diverged, and so now we have, at the moment, two code bases, but we&amp;#8217;re kind of getting back to one code base. So the free version is going to be basically a kind of stripped down pro version, the same code base. We just have like a build script that removes some of the files and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that makes it way easier for us to maintain and it&amp;#8217;s also better for our commercial customers because we can push out a big chunk of the commercial code base in the free plugin first before we do a release of the commercial plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: To kind of test the waters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, and I mean, you know, some of the bugs might get worked out and whatever. So that&amp;#8217;s how we&amp;#8217;re going to do our releases, so free version and then, maybe a couple weeks later, the pro version will go out. So yeah, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you see that as a way of also using the user base that your free version has to drive more people to the pro version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I mean between 40% and 50% of our sales are initiated from the free version of the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, wow! That&amp;#8217;s huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s massive. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: How are you tracking that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: We do coupon codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Ah! Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: In the free version, we give it a coupon code. We&amp;#8217;ve also got Google analytics tracking in all the links from the free version, so that&amp;#8217;s mainly how we track it. But we don&amp;#8217;t do anything &amp;#8212; everything is above board. Don&amp;#8217;t want to get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Zack, will you be doing some of the same kind of things with your Gravity Forms Directory add-on and pushing people over to GravityView?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah and, you know, it&amp;#8217;s funny. Even though they&amp;#8217;re not the same code base, and they&amp;#8217;re not the same plugin, I am going to be motivated to update my Gravity Forms Directory plugin because it will still reflect on the GravityView plugin, so I&amp;#8217;m going to be updating the plugin to have cross-promotional banner in the settings page, for example, but then I&amp;#8217;ll also fix some bugs and respond to tickets. And so it&amp;#8217;s definitely going to spill over. It&amp;#8217;s just interesting that it&amp;#8217;s not going to be for the same plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, because they&amp;#8217;re not actually going to be like 100% compatible. Like if I use Gravity Forms Directory for a month and then decide to go purchase GravityView, are they, I mean, can you migrate between them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right now, no. Thankfully the approved entries functionality will migrate, so that&amp;#8217;s one of the big things that I know that people have spent a lot of time on and one of the core functionality pieces of GravityView and the Directory plugin is you can approve and reject entries before they are displayed, so you could have somebody submit a form and they check a box, and the entry gets displayed on the website. So those approvals or rejections do get migrated. But other than that, the short code won&amp;#8217;t work now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But all the data is actually stored in Gravity Forms, so all the have to do is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; rebuild their view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s not a difficult migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: No, thankfully it&amp;#8217;s all based on Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And so just a plug for your sponsor, I did set up the demo site using Ninja Demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And it was a great process, and so it&amp;#8217;s nice to finally have a full-featured demo functionality that I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to have that functionality for years, so it&amp;#8217;s really cool to finally be able to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I know that I&amp;#8217;ve never wanted to take the time to build a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then they released it, and I built one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well and, yeah, how do you do the self-destruct? There was that CMS website where you could test all the different CMSs back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I tested out….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I forgot about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And it&amp;#8217;s like this demo will reset in three minutes, and I was like, &amp;#8220;How do they&amp;#8211;?&amp;#8221; You know, I guess they run a query or like a cron script. Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s really nice to have all that taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: For sure. I wish I had a demo-able plugin. I don&amp;#8217;t really yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: It would be the most boring demo ever, like move from this demo to this other demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know. I think you could demo WP Migrate DB Pro. Mostly just showing how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. A video is just as good though, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s really not that different than a video at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: …your posts get moved over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. Should we talk about&amp;#8211;? Well, we should probably mention WordPress Beta 2 is out, so get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Get it if you haven&amp;#8217;t already. Then do all your &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s looking really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Plugin developers should be testing on that, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If you&amp;#8217;re doing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Honestly, I think, as developers, we should always be running trunk, at least on our main development machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Trunk? Oh, I don&amp;#8217;t know there. Risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay, trunk or latest beta. Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I personally like trunk, but that&amp;#8217;s because I like to play with things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Isn&amp;#8217;t trunk pretty rough at times though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No. You can run trunk on a live site pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Really? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Really. I mean an example of something that is a little bit rough: over the last four weeks they&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of work on the WordPress media library for the grid view. And that grid view was pretty rough for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But it wasn&amp;#8217;t, like, it wasn&amp;#8217;t going to break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, in general, obviously it is trunk, so things can break. But, in general, trunk works perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. All right. Well, maybe we&amp;#8217;ll make a switch over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I like running trunk on all my development things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. What else should we mention here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: This is something that came out pretty recently. We tried to get to it last episode, but ended up running out of time, but it&amp;#8217;s something I would like to mention, and I think they mentioned it on WP Tavern recently. It&amp;#8217;s this website called WPCore.com. Have either of you guys played with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I just heard about that on the podcast, so I haven&amp;#8217;t played around with it. But, you know, I had a system for doing that back in the day with, you know, a zip file that I would pull in, and it&amp;#8217;s nice to have. It sounds like a really great functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. For anybody who&amp;#8217;s listening and hasn&amp;#8217;t heard of it yet, it basically allows you to build plugin collections. And so you go and build a collection of say 5, 10, 15, or even 100 plugins, and then it gives you a way to install that collection all at one time, which is really kind of cool. So maybe you have a suite of plugins that you use for your development sandbox, or you have another suite of plugins that you use for all of your client sites, or another suite that you use on all your personal sites. You could set up all these collections, and they just really easily install them all at one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: But I think the biggest thing for me about this is that it&amp;#8217;s all public and social, and you can actually use other people&amp;#8217;s collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I like that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Just as an example, there&amp;#8217;s somebody has a debugging collection that they&amp;#8217;ve published on the site, and so they&amp;#8217;re adding in plugins that are used for debugging, such as Debug Bar, one called &amp;#8220;what template file&amp;#8221;, and things like that. And I like that idea of having these collections that can then not necessarily be curated, but then, like, voted upon so we could have a community moderated list of the best development tools, the best security tools, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, that&amp;#8217;s kind of like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know what will happen with this, but I love the idea of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: It&amp;#8217;s kind of like Composer for plugins, like for plugin groups where you just point to a group and you say build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. Yeah. So the guy behind this, his name is Stuart Starr, and he reached out to me a couple weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Thanks for building something awesome, Stuart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, thanks, Stuart. This is cool stuff. I think people who use Composer to manage their stuff would probably be like, &amp;#8220;What do I need this for?&amp;#8221; And I don&amp;#8217;t know how I&amp;#8217;d answer that question, to be honest. I don&amp;#8217;t know if this has advantages over Composer or what. I don&amp;#8217;t use either. I don&amp;#8217;t use Composer, and I don&amp;#8217;t really have a need for any of this stuff. Do you guys use Composer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve used it a couple of times, and it is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah, I use the GitHub sub-modules and it just makes my brain hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: So I&amp;#8217;ve kind of moved over to sub-modules, but then that has its own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yes. The grass is always greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think this is something that will be huge for people that are doing &amp;#8212; that have a really high turn point for sites. So like if you turn out a lot of sites, I mean whether that means you&amp;#8217;re doing 100 sites a month or 2 sites a month, but it could be a very useful tool for those kind of people if they have those standard plugins that they install in every single client site. Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t build sites anymore. I have four or five sites that I run, but I&amp;#8217;m not building new sites every day, so it&amp;#8217;s not something that I&amp;#8217;m going to really use, but I can see it being very valuable for contractors and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Totally. Have you guys seen the show Halt and Catch Fire? Have you guys heard about this show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I&amp;#8217;ve seen an episode but haven&amp;#8217;t stayed up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Man, it&amp;#8217;s so nerdy and awesome. It&amp;#8217;s so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Tell me about it. This is news to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So it takes place in the early &amp;#8217;80s, so, you know, when I was in diapers probably. And it&amp;#8217;s kind of the beginning of the PC or the IBM compatible. So when the IBM &amp;#8212; I guess these people started up these computer companies that were basically clones of the IBM, right, of the IBM PC. And it&amp;#8217;s about a company that&amp;#8217;s making a run at it. And it&amp;#8217;s like craziness, right? So it&amp;#8217;s basically a startup, but it&amp;#8217;s a hardware startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Startup before startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, and it takes place in Texas, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I can&amp;#8217;t remember which city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s just great acting and great, you know, totally geek stuff. Like they&amp;#8217;re talking about, you know, they&amp;#8217;ve got a programmer that&amp;#8217;s like a punk, like and &amp;#8217;80s punk kid and she&amp;#8217;s like writing the operating system and, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s just really cool, so check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: I have to say I stopped watching it after the scene where she was like going to parties so that she could clear her mind and then she ends up writing the code for the compiler or something with lipstick on a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And of course she happens to be, you know, super hot and, like, you know, always wearing almost nothing. I took issue with that, but maybe I should give the show another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she&amp;#8217;s definitely kind of like the rogue character. And then you have &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s actually some pretty strong female characters in the show. I thought that was kind of unique, especially in the IT world, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What network is it played on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: AMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right. I may have to see if I can get a hold of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: They&amp;#8217;re the masters of the period pieces, right, like Mad Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: They do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: AMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so they just &amp;#8212; I mean the house that these people live in, it&amp;#8217;s just like screams &amp;#8217;80s. It&amp;#8217;s just I love that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I think we&amp;#8217;re getting pretty close to wrapping up here. Brad, you have another thing coming up pretty soon that I know that you&amp;#8217;re working on organizing. Do you want to tell us a little more about that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; for anybody who didn&amp;#8217;t catch it the last three episodes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So we&amp;#8217;re going to be snowboarding and talking business at Sugarbush Mountain in Vermont. And that little conference is called Big Snow Tiny Conf, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be January 26th to the 29th. We&amp;#8217;re going to get a chalet on the side of the hill, ski in, ski out, that kind of thing. It&amp;#8217;s going to be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it sounds fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: That does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Some come one, come all. So sign up to the email list BigSnowTinyConf.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: And what&amp;#8217;s your capacity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m hoping to make it out there so I can embarrass myself with my horrendous snowboarding skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Capacity? I think we&amp;#8217;re aiming for, you know, like 14, 15, 16 people, something like that. But, you know, we&amp;#8217;ll take less. We&amp;#8217;ll take maybe more. We haven&amp;#8217;t really decided on a cap or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And you&amp;#8217;re doing that with Brian Castle, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s right, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Awesome. Well, shall we wrap up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure thing. Review us on iTunes, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Much appreciate it if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. You can help people discover us, so that&amp;#8217;d be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Thanks, everybody, for tuning in and listening. And thank you, Zack, for coming on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Well, thank you, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Best of luck with your launch later today. I hope it goes wonderful for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZACK: Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: All right. Thanks, Zack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right. Thanks for listening, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Thanks, everybody.&lt;br /&gt;

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

BRAD: Yes, I am Brad Touesnard and joining me, as usual, is my cohost Pippin Williamson.

PIPPIN: Hello, everybody.

BRAD: And this is --

PIPPIN: Welcome to Episode 22. As usual, we have our sponsors from WP Ninjas with Ninja Forms. If you havent checked them out, go take a look at NinjaForms.com, as well as their NinjaDemo.com. And also joining us is Mr. Zack Katz. Do you want to say hello, Zack?

ZACK: Hey, guys.

PIPPIN: Why dont we --

BRAD: Thats an awesome name: Zack Katz. Thats a great name.

PIPPIN: It is pretty awesome.

ZACK: It sets me up for stardom, I think.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: It does.

BRAD: I mean my name is so not brandable its not even funny.

ZACK: Well, its the silent D.

BRAD: Yeah, it gets you every time, that silent D. Damn it.

PIPPIN: Well, it took me months to figure out how to pronounce your name.

BRAD: I know. I dont even think I pronounce it right half the time.

[Laughter]

PIPPIN: Nice. Zack, why dont we get started by having you tell us a little bit about yourself? What do you do? How long have you been working in WordPress, things like that?

ZACK: Well, Ive been working in WordPress since about 2006 or 2007, and I started with client work and kind of slowly transitioned into doing plugin development and then started with plugin development for myself and for clients, and now its my sole business. Its plugin developments and sales.

PIPPIN: Thats awesome. Now are you still -- you said you started with freelance. Was that primarily like theme development for clients, just the generic build a site for them and do everything like that?

ZACK: Yeah, exactly. And, you know, the way I got into plugins was, I think, the way a lot of people do is the client had a need, and there was no functionality out there for what they wanted to do, so I coded what needed to be coded. And I realized, oh, well, if I put this on the repo, other people can benefit from the work that Ive done. And its really -- it just caught on and I got really excited about being able to share the improvements that Ive been able to make.

BRAD: Cool. So when was --

PIPPIN: Thats exactly how I got started.

ZACK: Oh, yeah?

BRAD: When was the first plugin that you put on .org?

ZACK: It was, I think -- I had just looked at this the other day -- like 2006. It was three lines of code.

BRAD: Wow!

PIPPIN: Nice!

BRAD: 2006 is like old school though, man. Thats a long time ago.

ZACK: Yeah. I was surprised myself.

BRAD: Yeah, most people didnt even start with WordPress until -- like most people say 2008, right? Like its the --

ZACK: I think I started 2.5 was my first major update that I remember. I think I started at like 2.3, so maybe Im wrong about the date, but it was a while ago.

PIPPIN: I started in 2.8, I think.

ZACK: Yeah, 2.8 was a major one.

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now here&amp;#8217;s your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hello. I am Pippin Williamson. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost Brad Touesnard. And with us today is a special guest, Philip Arthur Moore, who used to work for Automatic, has done a lot of theme work as a Theme Wrangler, working on Underscore and some other things. And so we&amp;#8217;re really pleased to have Philip with us today. Philip, why don&amp;#8217;t you say hi and introduce yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Hello, hello. I am Philip, as Pippin said. Before Automatic, I worked at Graph Paper Press, which is a commercial theme shop. I did that for about two and a half, three years, and then jumped into Automatic work around 2011. Did that for about two and a half years. And then, earlier this year, around January or February, I left. And the last five months, I don&amp;#8217;t know where they&amp;#8217;ve gone. I&amp;#8217;ve just been sort of floating for the last five months and enjoying my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hey, there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That sounds terrible. Where&amp;#8217;s the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Oh, I&amp;#8217;ve been organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Where&amp;#8217;s your purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I&amp;#8217;ve been organizing WordCamp Hanoi. That&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, gees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hey, that takes a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Having been one of the co-organizers for a WordCamp, I can definitely attest to the amount of work it takes and is involved with organizing a WordCamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So that&amp;#8217;s really &amp;#8212; I mean, you&amp;#8217;ve been in the theme business for a while now working with Graph Paper Press, which is definitely one of the older theme companies that&amp;#8217;s been around for a long time, then as an Automatic Theme Wrangler. So obviously you like themes a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What is it? What is it about themes for you that you like so much? Is there a specific thing about themes? Do you spend a lot of time building themes? Are you reviewing themes? Maybe is there a focus for themes for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: So there&amp;#8217;s a company called BASF. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys have ever heard of it. And they have an &amp;#8212; this is not, you know, I&amp;#8217;m not one of their shills. I don&amp;#8217;t get paid to pimp them out. But they say something really interesting. And what they say is, &amp;#8220;At BASF, we don&amp;#8217;t make the things you use; we make the things you use better.&amp;#8221; And this is basically, for the last sort of six, seven, eight years, the stuff I get really excited about is making stuff better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So building themes is awesome. Building themes is really cool. It&amp;#8217;s great. I can &amp;#8212; you know, building themes is nice, but I like making them better. So at Automatic, for example, we would take a theme from WordPress.org, adapt it to WordPress.com, which basically means either refactoring the entire theme or thinking of a lot of new solutions for this large platform with knowing the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say, for example, like infinite scroll rolled out. What was this, like a year and a half ago or a year ago it really started sort of getting big? I remember spending a week literally going through every single theme that it had been implemented on, on WordPress.com and finding out what was wrong with it. So building themes is great. I think that what I really like doing through now is figuring out where they&amp;#8217;re terrible and how to make them better. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s sort of what I really like doing. But, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s all &amp;#8212; you know, building themes &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I love that focus on refinement and just saying, hey, we have this &amp;#8212; whether we&amp;#8217;re talking about themes or a particular API in a theme, or even plugins, but just the idea of saying let&amp;#8217;s focus on this, and let&amp;#8217;s make this better in any way that we can, as opposed to simply always just building new stuff, new themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, which is why &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Going back and refining them is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, which is why, you know &amp;#8212; sorry to cut in but, you know, to &amp;#8212; if you were to give me the choice of building a theme in a week and a half or two, or building one theme over the course of three or four months, I would probably pick the latter. This whole sort of like make more, more, more, more, more I think is terrible. I think it&amp;#8217;s ruining our industry. I think that it&amp;#8217;s just a terrible way to develop. It&amp;#8217;s not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Well, and I mean, it spreads your focus out so much as well. It&amp;#8217;s really hard to have a really polished product, regardless of whether you&amp;#8217;re in themes or you&amp;#8217;re in plugins or you&amp;#8217;re in some other completely other industry, the more products that you push out, I think the less polished each one of them is going to be. And it&amp;#8217;s just going to get worse and worse and worse because you&amp;#8217;re spreading your focus out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Is your &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So where do you see, over the next maybe couple of years, is there any specific direction that you see themes, as a whole in WordPress, going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: You know, this is one of those things I think we could probably talk about for hours. There are two parts to this, right? One is free themes, and one is premium. You know, if you want to talk about like free themes, I&amp;#8217;ll just take the very, very chunk, right, the default themes. My gut feeling, so the purpose of making a default theme is to showcase new features. It&amp;#8217;s basically showcasing new features that WordPress has introduced into Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of like the HTML 5, like Gallery Markup and stuff, was featured in 2014 and all this really cool stuff in 2013. It&amp;#8217;s sort of those default themes follow the development of Core. So what I expect to see from those is just pretty much a showcase of what Core has implemented and also, you know, playing around with different designs and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of like the other free themes, for example, like in Extend on WordPress.org, I don&amp;#8217;t know. I guess we&amp;#8217;ll see. I don&amp;#8217;t spend much time at all making free themes or encouraging people to make free themes, which is kind of a weird thing to say. But I generally kind of associate quality around a product, whether it&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; theme like a default theme or a premium theme with, you know, money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who make default themes, they&amp;#8217;re paid employees of Automatic, so they get paid to do this stuff. And people who do premium themes get paid to do that as well, so a lot of the innovation, I think, is going to continue to either come from default themes or premium theme shops like, you know, Theme Foundry or Graph Paper Press or, you know, I don&amp;#8217;t know, an Obox or whoever. I think a lot of the innovation is going to continue coming from premium theme shops, which is why I love the idea of them sort of being a part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: In terms of like where I see it going, if you want to talk about features or sort of innovation, I really, really see and, you know, maybe this is the same in plugin land as well. My hunch is that, over the next kind of two or three years especially, everything is going to go very, very much towards the direction of CMS stuff. Just stuff related to CMSE type, you know, static page based content that we haven&amp;#8217;t really touched. You know, custom post types, stuff like how to build a business, or how to build large, large sites with WordPress themes. We&amp;#8217;re going to have to adapt to that because right now if you go on WordPress.org and look at all the themes, it kind of feels like they&amp;#8217;re just skins for blogs, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Like that&amp;#8217;s sort of &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s what it feels like, and that&amp;#8217;s what I think. Themes have spent ten years sort of embracing that. And I think that&amp;#8217;s….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you think maybe the default themes included in WordPress, do you think they will ever start to embrace those as well? We see a lot of, as you put it, the CMS type features embraced by some of the premium themes in the market, and not so much with themes listed on WordPress.org. And so do you think that the default themes in WordPress will bridge that gap at any point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Well, it&amp;#8217;s interesting because Konstantin Obenland, he developed 2014 and 2013, and so the designer of 2014 was Takashi. The designer of 2013 &amp;#8212; Takashi Irie &amp;#8212; God, his last name is terrible to say, but he&amp;#8217;s a great guy, fantastic designer. He made 2014. Yohan made 2013, and Konstantin developed both 2013 and 2014 with Lance Willett sort of overseeing it and kind of co-checking and stuff. And Konstantin wrote an interesting blog post&amp;#8211;this was several months ago&amp;#8211;saying how he wants 2015 to be a lot simpler, literally like maybe a style sheet, maybe something that could be developed in two or three weeks or a month instead of three and a half months or four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what? I feel like that&amp;#8217;s going to come down to just decision making on the part of Automatic and on the part of what Matt wants because he&amp;#8217;s the one who selects sort of the design. It&amp;#8217;s sort of like his baby. So if that&amp;#8217;s where he wants to see things go, awesome. If not, then maybe we&amp;#8217;ll see more CMS-type stuff. But I would love it. I would love for that focus to be sort of paid attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I would definitely like to see it embraced for at least in the realm of custom post types. I&amp;#8217;ve always felt like custom post types were so much of a &amp;#8212; I mean obviously it&amp;#8217;s an amazing feature that has radically changed what&amp;#8217;s possible in WordPress and what people do with it, but it&amp;#8217;s also kind of felt ignored in some ways. Just as an example, they&amp;#8217;re 100% ignored in all of the mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If you have data in a post type, it&amp;#8217;s unreachable in any of the OS, I mean any of the mobile apps, whether you&amp;#8217;re in iOS, android, or Windows. And I would love to see those kinds of bridges get taken care of. I think that could apply both to things like the mobile apps, to default themes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I would agree. The only reason I use the mobile apps personally is just to consume information. It&amp;#8217;s to look at blogs that I&amp;#8217;m subscribed to. It&amp;#8217;s not to write posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for my personal site, which is just a blog, you know, it&amp;#8217;s just sort of a professional/personal blog. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s somewhat easy, but still there are limitations of how to upload images and how to sort of do things that you would do in a desktop just in a normal browser. So the iOS app, I almost kind of treat it like a consumption app, and maybe they want to get away from that. Maybe they&amp;#8217;re trying to &amp;#8212; maybe they want people to be producing content with it. But it&amp;#8217;s just not something that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s interesting for me because I&amp;#8217;ve never used it as a consumption app. I&amp;#8217;ve only used it for producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I barely ever use it for anything, so there. I win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I will say though, I discovered &amp;#8212; I had never really used it on a daily basis. Every now and then, if I had an idea and I wanted to drop a draft in, I would use it for that. But recently I started using it for running a little, personal blog, like a little, personal, photo blog for some of the woodworking stuff that I do on the side. And it was awesome for that, but otherwise I&amp;#8217;ve never used it on a day-to-day basis. It&amp;#8217;s really great for things like food blogging, but that&amp;#8217;s kind of no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: No. My only sort of &amp;#8212; and this is a very, very brief aside &amp;#8212; my only beef with it, and it might have changed, is that normally you&amp;#8217;ll notice that when you upload media into WordPress, whatever you insert that image into your post in, it has those widths and heights hard coded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Which it bothers me. It drives me nuts because the moment you either switch a theme or the moment you sort of change that overall look, it kills everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It&amp;#8217;s terrible. So what I&amp;#8217;ve done for the longest time, probably for the last two or three years, is I never insert the image. I just insert a short code that says gallery. And it just kind of &amp;#8212; even if it&amp;#8217;s one image, I insert it as a gallery, a short code that literally just says gallery size large. So whatever theme I&amp;#8217;m using, it&amp;#8217;s just going to pull whatever theme has determined that size large to be. And it&amp;#8217;s hard to do stuff like that in the mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s funny. Last week we had a discussion, Pip and I, about commoditization of themes. And we kind of hit a wall. It&amp;#8217;s kind of one of the reasons why we wanted to have you on, actually, because we don&amp;#8217;t know a whole lot about WordPress.com themes and the whole business that&amp;#8217;s there. And one of the questions we didn&amp;#8217;t know how to answer was how much support do theme authors on WordPress.com get? Is that something that you were aware of when you were working there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, I had to give support every day. That&amp;#8217;s what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you, as an Automatic employee, or as a past employee, were you the one providing support, or the individual theme author provides support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Absolutely. No, absolutely. Oh, okay, okay. So whatever theme you make, so WordPress.com has Automatic &amp;#8212; so let&amp;#8217;s just talk about premium. Okay? WordPress.com has, let&amp;#8217;s say, 15 Automatic developed themes and all the others are premium themes developed by other shops, third party shops. Those third party shops are responsible for supporting their themes on that platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: There&amp;#8217;s a forum, so support is done in a forum. It&amp;#8217;s a bit janky right now because now I think there are like 90 or 95 premium themes. There are a lot of premium themes on WordPress.com now. And the forum is public, so if you were to Google premium theme support forum WordPress.com, you would be able to see all of these theme specific forums for those premium themes on WordPress.com. So if a user buys a premium theme on WordPress.com, they get that sort of lifetime. This lifetime support drives me nuts, but they get lifetime support for a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if it&amp;#8217;s an Automatic made theme, we&amp;#8217;re the ones supporting that. So all the Theme Wranglers &amp;#8212; now because the company has grown, there&amp;#8217;s a specific support person who goes and does a lot of that theme support. So now it&amp;#8217;s not like that as much. Maybe a year and a half ago, it was the theme developers at Automatic who was doing that support for those themes. Now we&amp;#8217;ve sort of had two or three support people come on who don&amp;#8217;t have a background in developing themes who provide support for the themes on WordPress.com. The support around themes on .com is a bit &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s easier than support on .org. It just is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, because it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It&amp;#8217;s still not &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s still &amp;#8212; yeah, it&amp;#8217;s hosted. It&amp;#8217;s still not a walk in the park. It&amp;#8217;s still there are tons of these little, weird, obscure things that happen that you have to kind of dig into in terms of code, but it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier, I think, for someone without a background in development to come and support a lot of that stuff because some of the stuff these users are asking for are simple customization and how do I turn something blue or red, which it&amp;#8217;s just a waste of time for a theme developer to be answering those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Right. But I guess in the case of a &amp;#8212; if you have a premium theme up on WordPress.com, what is the volume of support requests that you would get on there? Do have any idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I was just looking at a couple because I was curious. I was browsing through it to see those support forums. And obviously I&amp;#8217;m sure this varies from theme to theme and, Arthur, you can probably give us some better stats. But looking at, for example, pocket, which is one of the themes from Mike McAllister and his array site, which launched June 27th, it has one support question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah. So go &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Now I have no idea what sales stats are for that theme and for that time period. What do you think, Arthur? Is support pretty low on .com themes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as an example, if we take any theme such as ones that were on Theme Forest as the predominant marketplace, a theme that&amp;#8217;s been live for about two weeks would probably have 50 or even 100 comments and questions on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Well, the usability is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It&amp;#8217;s a completely different situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I mean, even if you took a Creative Market. Let&amp;#8217;s take Creative Market, right? That&amp;#8217;s another marketplace, the same sort of &amp;#8212; each of these marketplaces encourages a certain development mindset. And so WordPress.com encourages a certain development mindset. Yeah, you&amp;#8217;re developing for a hosted platform, but Theme Wranglers, the people reviewing the stuff, there&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8212; WordPress.com users have bene trained to use themes in certain ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: So let&amp;#8217;s say you have four or five Theme Wranglers at Automatic who are reviewing themes. You know, we all have our biases, so develop.wordpress.com or, I think it&amp;#8217;s like, developer.wordpress.com has all this stuff that you can&amp;#8217;t do on WordPress.com. It&amp;#8217;s either because it&amp;#8217;s just not good for themes. It&amp;#8217;s either because, you know, don&amp;#8217;t use custom colors because there&amp;#8217;s already a plugin available for it on WordPress.com. Don&amp;#8217;t use custom fonts in a theme because we already have a plugin on WordPress.com that takes care of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start taking out all that sort of .org focus customization around themes, a lot of the times what you get with themes, for example like what Mike did with OK Themes and then Array, is these very, very kind of blog focused themes that are extremely dead simple to set up in a hosted platform. And so a lot of the questions you might look at are completely around customization, like how do I change the size of something. It&amp;#8217;s not how do I override something in a child theme. Those aren&amp;#8217;t the types of questions you&amp;#8217;re getting because it&amp;#8217;s just a hosted platform, which is what I think what would be really nice in the next sort of five years is for a lot of these theme shops to developed hosted solutions to prevent this sort of, like you said, the first week of launching a theme, getting 50 questions. I don&amp;#8217;t think that should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I absolutely agree. I don&amp;#8217;t know that I would like to see all these theme shops have their own hosted solutions, but I would like to see themes treated in the same way that they&amp;#8217;re treated on hosted solutions. To me, a theme is designed to be a theme. A theme is not designed to be your starting point for your own completely custom site. I mean if you want to use it that way, you&amp;#8217;re more than welcome to, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But that&amp;#8217;s one of the things I love about themes on WordPress.com is it&amp;#8217;s very much this is you activate it and you&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You maybe set up your widgets. And whether we&amp;#8217;re talking very simple blog themes or much more advanced CMS themes, I would love for that to be the norm. And I think some of that is training users in what to or how you should be using a theme. And a lot of it is also just the sheer quality of the theme. There are always going to be themes that work much better for that than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I would love to see that goal, progression towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I think the way that that happens is, you know, and I kind of touched on this a little bit, you know, blogged about it a bit, but I really think the way that happens is that theme developers need to start paying a lot more attention to the experience around their theme. It&amp;#8217;s not difficult to take underscores and code out a theme and put it on .org in a week. It&amp;#8217;s just not difficult to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really, really, really hard to get the experience around the moment someone unboxes your theme to the moment they&amp;#8217;re going from sort of like A to Z, from this is how it looks on your demo site to them pressing &amp;#8220;activate&amp;#8221;. That&amp;#8217;s a very, very painful process. Even in the best of circumstances, it&amp;#8217;s a very, very painful process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the ideal sort of theme developer&amp;#8217;s responsibility is to eliminate that pain. You know, WordPress is not some sort of golden child of usability. There are problems with the software. And if the theme is introducing all these layers of complexity, this is how you get like 50 or 60 support questions in a week or 2. It&amp;#8217;s just because it&amp;#8217;s been coded in a way that makes the experience around it really, really difficult to set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Definitely. 100%. Let&amp;#8217;s move on a little bit. Still in the realm of themes, let&amp;#8217;s talk about the Customizer. First of all, do you like the Customizer? Just a simple question for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, I do. I think it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; yeah, I think it&amp;#8217;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think there&amp;#8217;s some really cool stuff being done with it. And have you been paying attention to the improvements that are being done for 4.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I have, and I&amp;#8217;m really interested to see what happens with theme options now that panels are available in the Customizer. I&amp;#8217;m really, really curious to see if theme options increase because now there&amp;#8217;s panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Can you tell us a little bit more about the panels? I&amp;#8217;ve seen it briefly. I think I&amp;#8217;ve seen it in the context of widgets, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it for, say, individual themes. Is it allowing themes to basically register their own panel in the Customizer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So the same way that sections are used in the Customizer right now, now they&amp;#8217;ve basically extended it out into panels. So not only can you add these custom controls inside of sections, but now you can have panels. And so let&amp;#8217;s say, for example, in the header you want to call a panel &amp;#8220;header&amp;#8221;, and you want to call another panel &amp;#8220;footer&amp;#8221;. Inside of that panel it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, the YoDog name. It&amp;#8217;s like I heard you like panels in your panels, so we&amp;#8217;re going to put a panel in your panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: So in the footer panel let&amp;#8217;s say you have an option, like all these different sections. Let&amp;#8217;s say you want to have a section on colors, or let&amp;#8217;s say you want to have a section on copywrite text or all this stuff. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago or two, remember how at WordCamp San Francisco there was this sort of big thing about how theme options are the devil. Then we&amp;#8217;ve got to get rid of them. It was very weird. It was let&amp;#8217;s get rid of theme options and, in lieu of those, we&amp;#8217;re going to use a Customizer. Well, those were theme options. They&amp;#8217;re just a different way of doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: What people have started saying is stop using theme options pages and, instead of theme options pages, use a Customizer. And so what naturally happened is that you don&amp;#8217;t have space to have 50 options inside the Customizer that you would have had space for on an individual options page, right? So before panels in the Customizer, you had a very, very limited amount of space. Well, now that there&amp;#8217;s panels, does it now mean that themes are going to start introducing a ton of new options because there&amp;#8217;s space for it now? That&amp;#8217;s just sort of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s very likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see, I think, but I&amp;#8217;m glad they added it in. I think it&amp;#8217;s cool. It&amp;#8217;ll just be interesting to see what theme developers do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, absolutely. And I believe WordPress Core, the only place that it actually uses a panel is for widgets, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So you open up the Customizer and it shows you the widget section, which used to, in 3.9, would just drop down and then shows you your widget areas. Now it actually moves over to a new panel and then shows a section for each of your main sidebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yep. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It is pretty cool. I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with Trunk for the last couple of days and kind of watching things change, and I do like it a lot. I think it is likely that we will … pushed into a Customizer, which I don&amp;#8217;t know is necessarily a bad thing. A lot of times I&amp;#8217;m in the camp of, hey, let&amp;#8217;s get rid of theme options for some of the same reasons mentioned a little bit ago when we talked about themes on WordPress.com and how it&amp;#8217;s a hosted solution. I like to have a lack of options. But I will say that even if you have a theme that has a lot of options, now there is a very set way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So even if you have a lot of options, at least will still have consistency as opposed to everyone builds their own theme options panel, and they have to figure out how the heck to build it because, as we all know, the settings API is not always the easiest thing to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: At least we won&amp;#8217;t have 100 different versions of the Customizer. We&amp;#8217;ll just have the Customizer that has a whole bunch of different options in it. But it will still have that consistent experience at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: How much do you find that you work with a Customizer as a plugin developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve never worked with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It&amp;#8217;s just not &amp;#8212; like it&amp;#8217;s just not something you need to think or worry so much about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I like the idea of working with it at some point. Let&amp;#8217;s say we have a plugin that has a lot of templates in it. Let&amp;#8217;s take bbPress for example. So bbPress has a ton of templates, and it has a lot of front-end output, obviously, for all the forms. And I think it would be kind of cool if there was a bbPress section for the Customizer. Just as an example, ways that maybe you could tweak the different styling of the form. I don&amp;#8217;t know that I love that idea, but if that&amp;#8217;s how it was to be &amp;#8212; if we were to use the Customizer in plugins, maybe in that way, or even for disabling like front-end features for a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we stay with bbPress, imagine that at some point bbPress decides to add control over what columns are displayed on the form. Now it doesn&amp;#8217;t, but if they were to introduce that kind of option, that to me is something that can very easily put into the Customizer. You go to forms, and you say, okay, I want to enable or disable these columns, just like you do in screen options in the admin. Features like that I think would be cool to have in plugins. I don&amp;#8217;t know. It&amp;#8217;s a little iffy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Brad, do you want to throw in anything about the Customizer? Do you ever work with it as a plugin developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ve never worked with it as a plugin developer. I think it&amp;#8217;s very much a theme-oriented thing, right? I don&amp;#8217;t even know; I can&amp;#8217;t even think of a plugin that has affected the Customizer for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, it&amp;#8217;s a little tricky right now because they&amp;#8217;re actually &amp;#8212; Arthur, if I get this wrong, correct me &amp;#8212; but all of the settings in Customizer are actually stored in the theme mods. And so you can&amp;#8217;t actually store a plugin setting in it right now, can you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: You can, but so &amp;#8212; well, what do you mean when you say plugin setting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, no, I know what I&amp;#8217;m thinking of. The Customizer uses&amp;#8211;what is it&amp;#8211;the function like get theme mod?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, yeah. So there are three different ways to sort of store your options via the Customizer. One is an older way. I think it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; Otto wrote a fantastic tutorial on this a year or so back, but the way that I use it primarily is via theme mods, and that&amp;#8217;s just the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say that you add a setting in for copywrite text for someone to add copywrite into their site, or someone to &amp;#8212; they want their default sidebar position to be on the right side of their site. Okay? That&amp;#8217;s just stored as a theme mod. So you can do a lot of stuff with that like &amp;#8212; all you&amp;#8217;re doing is get theme mod. Like you&amp;#8217;re just checking with get theme mod. So that&amp;#8217;s pretty much how all options are set within the Customizer by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a plugin, or if you have a theme that&amp;#8217;s using the old style of doing it, then you can certainly &amp;#8212; the Customizer can work with that. It&amp;#8217;s just the way that you tell it how it&amp;#8217;s storing that data. But you can &amp;#8212; you know, either way whether you&amp;#8217;re doing it the old way or the new way, it&amp;#8217;s all fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I use theme mod, like just get theme mod for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. If you were to use it as a plugin, you would use the other option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: If I were to &amp;#8212; so here&amp;#8217;s a perfect example. This plugin I just released on .org, it was like a month ago or so. It&amp;#8217;s called Subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: You know, all it does is add subtitles into your site. I&amp;#8217;m not going to do this at all, but let&amp;#8217;s just say I wanted to add in an option or some sort of option into the plugin that allows you to colorize that subtitle. I don&amp;#8217;t know why I would do that, but let&amp;#8217;s just say I wanted to do that, or I wanted to give you control over the exact scaling or size of that subtitle because now it just has a default scaling. And if you want to adjust that, you need to kind of understand how the API works for the plugin. And users don&amp;#8217;t understand how do to that, so if I want to add in a control into the Customizer that says I add in a section that says subtitles. I add in a control that&amp;#8217;s a color picker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Customizer, you pick your color. You save it. All that&amp;#8217;s doing is being saved as a &amp;#8212; you know what? I could do theme mod. Like I could use theme mod. But it&amp;#8217;s kind of weird, right, because it&amp;#8217;s a plugin setting. It&amp;#8217;s a plugin specific setting. It&amp;#8217;s not like a theme specific setting. I see what you&amp;#8217;re kind of getting at with the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featured content also has this kind of weird thing where the featured content plugin that&amp;#8217;s in Jetpack and also in 2014, the way that they store options, like if you want to extend that plugin, and you want to do something special with it within your theme, you&amp;#8217;ve got to store that as a theme mod because it&amp;#8217;s specific to that theme. But if it&amp;#8217;s a plugin, yeah, you probably want to avoid that. That&amp;#8217;s a good on. It&amp;#8217;s a good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s definitely something I think that we&amp;#8217;ll see hashed out a lot more as the Customizer evolves. And I am excited to see where it goes. I might; maybe based off of this, I&amp;#8217;ll start playing with it for implementing it, like taking the Customizer and trying to use it within a plugin to add settings and see how it works. It would be a fun experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. Should we talk about the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Before we &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; the Plugin Installer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What was that, Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Should we talk &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; talk about the new Plugin Installer that&amp;#8217;s looking pretty cool in WordPress 4.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, why don&amp;#8217;t you take us away on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What are they doing with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s basically just a new model popup box, and so they&amp;#8217;re adding the banner image that&amp;#8217;s on WordPress.org. So any plugin that has banner image, it&amp;#8217;s going to show up within WordPress, which is pretty cool. It looks pretty nice. But we&amp;#8217;re going to link up the blog post from WP Tavern in the Show notes so you guys can take a look at the screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s looking really, really good. I think, on top of the banners that they&amp;#8217;re showing, the model itself has changed a little bit. Not much. It&amp;#8217;s just some minor tweaks. But like adding in the reviews and avatars and names of all the contributors is pretty cool. I like it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: There are already reviews though, right? Isn&amp;#8217;t there already a rating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There&amp;#8217;s an overall rating, but not the individual reviews. Now you can go in and you can see the breakdown of the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Five star, four star, three star, two star, one star, etc., just like you see in a sidebar on .org. Then it also has opened up each of the tabs. All the tabs that are in the read me are now available from the installer, which I think they actually have always been, but the reviews tab is listed as well, and you can read like the last ten reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s cool. Then you don&amp;#8217;t have to bounce over to .org to get the reviews, so that&amp;#8217;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then the overall display of like the plugins&amp;#8217; install page, when you go to add new plugin, then you go to &amp;#8212; when you either search or you click featured or you click popular or newest or anything like that, it looks completely different now. They&amp;#8217;ve replaced it with what they call cards, so plugin cards. So instead of just being a line item in a table, it&amp;#8217;s a complete card that makes it a lot easier to kind of read what the plugin is, see the rating, see the download counts. It&amp;#8217;s really pretty slick looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Have you played with it yet, Arthur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I have. My install locally gets updated every six hours, so I love seeing all these sort of changes because, every day I go to work, I sort of click into the backend and see what&amp;#8217;s happening. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve sort of kept up with all this stuff. It&amp;#8217;s very, very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: The plugin cards, I mean, what&amp;#8217;s currently in WordPress really is not much of a design. I don&amp;#8217;t think much design thought went into what&amp;#8217;s currently there, right? And it&amp;#8217;s just kind of one of those areas of the dashboard that had never really been focused on with any &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which part? What it used to be or what it is now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What it is now, like in the current stable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Things have been added little by little, but I don&amp;#8217;t think a designer went in there and like really focused on cleaning it up, right? And so this is like a huge step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: From what&amp;#8217;s there now, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I like seeing the separation from the standard list tables and making each view more specialized and focused for what it is, as opposed to just putting all the data, everything that we can imagine, whether they&amp;#8217;re posts or pages or plugins or themes, in a list table. And the same goes for all the changes that were made to the theme installer recently. I like that we&amp;#8217;re now focusing on, well, what kind of data are we presenting and how should we present it, as opposed to, well, we have data. Let&amp;#8217;s just throw it in a list table. I really like that focus, and some of that is happening in 4.0 with the media library as well with the new grid view that they&amp;#8217;re introducing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s slick, if you guys have played with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, the only thing I&amp;#8217;ve noticed with that so far is that everything has got this sort of infinite scroll type thing to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, no. Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It&amp;#8217;s kind of like this sort of just cognitive overload in a way where it&amp;#8217;s like I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure. It&amp;#8217;s like I&amp;#8217;m getting lost in this sea of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Why? Why? So there&amp;#8217;s an infinite scroll within the media library now? Is that what you&amp;#8217;re saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: At the time of recording, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yes, there&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8212; this is 4.0 Beta 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: If you….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But only happens if you view in the grid view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Is that going to be the default, though, I think, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s bizarre though to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I haven&amp;#8217;t seen any indication of it not being default. I&amp;#8217;ve been following the track ticket for it, and I haven&amp;#8217;t seen any discussion about making it not default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I thought the only purpose of infinite scroll was to make you consume more Twitters or Facebooks. Right? I thought that was the &amp;#8212; because it&amp;#8217;s a usability nightmare, right? You know, you click on something and then you go back, and then you&amp;#8217;re lost, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I lost a lot of sleep over infinite scroll on WordPress.com. Yes. I spent several weeks trying to figure out a way to make that just &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know. Something about it just always drove me a bit crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I guess it would, the business case would apply to WordPress.com too, right, because you want people to consume more WordPress.com, so they can just infinite scroll forever, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah, but &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t want to get off on a tangent, but you&amp;#8217;ve got to ask yourself is that good for the Web. Is that good for the Internet? Is it contributing to this attention deficit disorder of being able to focus on one thing and one thing only at one time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Versus this constant sense of got to see more, got to see more, got to see more, got to see more. It&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8212; you know, just slow down. Slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean if you can&amp;#8217;t click a button to go to the next article, I think you should probably just, you know, finish up for the day. That&amp;#8217;s what I think. I think you&amp;#8217;re done, right? If that&amp;#8217;s too much friction for you, I think you should go to bed or something. I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: On that note, I&amp;#8217;m not sure if we have a next button onto our next topic, so maybe we should be done. I think we are getting about to the point where we should wrap up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Arthur, thank you so much for joining us, and thank you for staying up far later than I know you would like to and maybe drinking an extra cup of coffee. For anybody who is not aware, Arthur is in Viet Nam right now, and it&amp;#8217;s, what, about midnight, getting close to 1:00 there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It is. It&amp;#8217;s 11:45. But this was fun, and I never told you this, but I first saw you actually at PressNomics last year. I saw you on a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When are you going to be coming back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: I will try my best to come back for the next one. And you said something that I think everyone should know. And you said that everyone should determine what it is that they want for their life and go backwards from that in terms of kind of how they&amp;#8217;re doing, sort of figuring out their way in this wild, wild west of the Web. That was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It was great. I loved that. I just wanted to tell you that it was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Good. Well, I should give Shane Pearlman credit for that. He is the one that first told me that, and I really took it to heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I was going to say, Pippin, you must have stole that from somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, absolutely. I&amp;#8217;m not nearly good enough to come up with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, that&amp;#8217;s great though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Yeah, PressNomics III is coming up in January, which will be awesome. I will definitely be there again and really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real quick before we shut off, I want to give a quick shout out to our sponsors once again. WP Ninjas is kind enough to be a permanent sponsor for us, and so we get to talk about them a lot, and they have a really cool product out right now that they&amp;#8217;ve been iterating on over the last few weeks called NinjaDemo.com. It&amp;#8217;s for setting up live demonstrations of your WordPress themes and your plugins, and it&amp;#8217;s a really slick product. We&amp;#8217;ve been using it on Affiliate WP, and I&amp;#8217;ve been really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur, quickly, before we sign off, where can people find you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: PhilipArthurMoore.com, and I&amp;#8217;m on Twitter as Philip_Arthur. For anyone who may or may not be in Asia in the next two months, we&amp;#8217;ve got WordCamp Hanoi coming up, and I will probably be at WordCamp San Francisco this year. There&amp;#8217;s like a 75%, 80% chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, hey, Brad, before we sign off, do you want to really quick tell people about what&amp;#8217;s new around Apply Filters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so this has been a work in progress for a while, and we&amp;#8217;ve got new branding, so we had a new logo done at Envato Studio. And Chris Aprea, a guy who works with me with Delicious Brains, Inc., he has built our site, basically. We took a theme off of &amp;#8212; I think it was Code Canyon, right, or Theme Forest, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: He got it working with a simple podcasting plugin, and it&amp;#8217;s looking great. We&amp;#8217;re really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When did they re-launch the site? Yesterday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep. We quietly, quietly rolled it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So anyway, yeah, if you want to go check it out, let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Quietly rolled it out yesterday, and a few people noticed already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: It looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A few people noticed, so we&amp;#8217;ve got like two people listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s great. All right. Thank you so much, Arthur, for coming on, and thanks, everybody, who is listening. If there are any questions at any point about anything that we talked about, hit us up on Twitter, on Facebook. Leave comments on the site. Thanks, everybody, for listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHILIP: Thanks, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Arthur, thanks so much for coming on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

PIPPIN: Hello. I am Pippin Williamson. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost Brad Touesnard. And with us today is a special guest, Philip Arthur Moore, who used to work for Automatic, has done a lot of theme work as a Theme Wrangler, working on Underscore and some other things. And so were really pleased to have Philip with us today. Philip, why dont you say hi and introduce yourself?

PHILIP: Hello, hello. I am Philip, as Pippin said. Before Automatic, I worked at Graph Paper Press, which is a commercial theme shop. I did that for about two and a half, three years, and then jumped into Automatic work around 2011. Did that for about two and a half years. And then, earlier this year, around January or February, I left. And the last five months, I dont know where theyve gone. Ive just been sort of floating for the last five months and enjoying my life.

PIPPIN: Hey, theres nothing wrong with that.

BRAD: That sounds terrible. Wheres the purpose.

PHILIP: Oh, Ive been organizing.

BRAD: Wheres your purpose?

PHILIP: Ive been organizing WordCamp Hanoi. Thats what Ive been doing.

BRAD: Oh, gees.

PIPPIN: Hey, that takes a lot of work.

BRAD: Yeah, thats a full-time job.

PIPPIN: Having been one of the co-organizers for a WordCamp, I can definitely attest to the amount of work it takes and is involved with organizing a WordCamp.

PHILIP: Yeah.

PIPPIN: So thats really -- I mean, youve been in the theme business for a while now working with Graph Paper Press, which is definitely one of the older theme companies thats been around for a long time, then as an Automatic Theme Wrangler. So obviously you like themes a lot.

PHILIP: I do.

PIPPIN: What is it? What is it about themes for you that you like so much? Is there a specific thing about themes? Do you spend a lot of time building themes? Are you reviewing themes? Maybe is there a focus for themes for you?

PHILIP: So theres a company called BASF. I dont know if you guys have ever heard of it. And they have an -- this is not, you know, Im not one of </itunes:summary>

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Episode 20&#160;gets into a discussion about how our failures as developers can hugely influence&#160;how we work now and the processes that we use in our day to day development. We also touch briefly on a new plugin from Andrew Norcross called Airplane Mode, the &amp;#8220;commoditization&amp;#8221; of WordPress themes, and the recent security vulnerability in the popular TimThumb script. &lt;span id="more-174"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now here&amp;#8217;s your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD Yes, I am Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my co-host Pippin Williamson. Say hello, Pippin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: This is Episode 20, and in this episode we are going to be talking about our biggest failures in our WordPress development or just development in generally, really. And then we&amp;#8217;re going to get into some news items. Let&amp;#8217;s talk first about what we&amp;#8217;ve been up to. What have you been up to, Pippin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, first of all, I took a vacation recently for the first time in a while, like a true vacation where I actually shut down and didn&amp;#8217;t do any work or very little work. I went up to Canada to visit some family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Dear God, Canada!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah! I know there are some crazy people up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I was right there on Lake Ontario outside of Toronto, and it was a beautiful little area. But it was really nice to kind of shut down for a little bit. And then I came home after being up there for about five or six days and immediately started working on a new add-on for Affiliate WP for tracking recurring referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since Affiliate WP was launched, one of the biggest feature requests we&amp;#8217;ve gotten was the ability to have recurring referrals so that you can reward affiliates commissions on a lifetime of a customer. So if a customer signs up for your membership, and then they pay you a monthly fee or a yearly fee, that affiliate can gain a referral on every payment that they make for the lifetime of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, because right now they only get the first, the very first sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, they would get the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So let&amp;#8217;s say they sign up for a $20 monthly payment and you get a 20% commission, so you get &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: $4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, exactly. You get $4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, so now instead, if somebody signs up for a $20 monthly payment and is a member for 4 years, that affiliate has now just received a much larger earning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, whatever that comes out to. I&amp;#8217;m not that quick at math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m not going to try and do the math in my head. I&amp;#8217;ll fail. But anyway, so I was working on that add-on for it, which is an add-on available to our developer license holders that adds support for that for WooCommerce subscriptions, my Restrict Content Pro plugin, the membership add-on for Easy Digital Downloads, membership add-on for iThemes Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then we&amp;#8217;ve got a couple more that it&amp;#8217;s going to support. It will support Gravity Forms, MemberMouse, Pay Memberships Pro, and maybe a couple of others. But anyway, so all of that add-on, that was built as one add-on, and we got that pushed out the door two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I&amp;#8217;m pretty pleased with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You must have been getting quite a few people requesting that stuff. Were you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We had a couple of requests every single week for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so we had a pretty long list of customers that had either purchased or said that they were waiting for that to purchase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Did you have anybody basically offer to like fund the development of it? I get that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We do see that a lot. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve seen that with everything from EDD extensions to custom plugins to Affiliate WP. And I think we did have a couple of users that mentioned that they would be willing to fund the development. I didn&amp;#8217;t take anybody up on it, for one, because I was already going to build it and I knew that it wasn&amp;#8217;t an issue of having the funds to develop it. It was mostly figuring out when I&amp;#8217;m going to sit down and actually build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The cool thing about the add-on is it&amp;#8217;s actually pretty simple. It&amp;#8217;s not a complex system at all to build as long as each of the membership plugins that are tracking these recurring payments. As long as they have the necessary hooks in place when a recurring payment is logged, it&amp;#8217;s actually not difficult to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I found that it works based on what we call integrations. Each integration, like Restrict Content Pro would be an integration. WooCommerce subscriptions would be an integration. And so each one of these integrations for each of these plugins is a class that extends a base class. Each one of them is, on average, 40 or 50 lines of code maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, it&amp;#8217;s pretty small. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I managed to add in support for WooCommerce subscriptions in about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: For example, I&amp;#8217;m going to add in MemberMouse here in the next week or two, and it&amp;#8217;s probably going to take maybe 30 minutes to add in and test. Now the extension, the add-on took far longer than that to build because I had to lay the framework for it and build some stuff around it. But now that it&amp;#8217;s built, adding support for additional systems is usually pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, because you built it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, which is the same way that Affiliate WP is the base plugin work too. If there&amp;#8217;s a new e-commerce plugin that comes out tomorrow, as long as they have the proper hooks, I could add in support to it for Affiliate WP in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. That&amp;#8217;s awesome. So I heard that when you were in Canada there was basically no cell service whatsoever for your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: For me there wasn&amp;#8217;t because I completely neglected to think about the fact that my current plan would not work in Canada because I don&amp;#8217;t have an international plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, it&amp;#8217;s your plan. So it would have worked if you had an international plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It would have worked. Honestly, I could have gone to Verizon and said, &amp;#8220;Hey, I&amp;#8217;m going to be in Canada. I want to purchase a temporary plan.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It probably would have cost me $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I could have done it really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I completely forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Every time I go to the U.S., I shell out $45 for like a data plan for 150 megs, which is completely nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s exactly what I would have done. So I completely forgot about it until I got there. And, at that time I just decided, &amp;#8220;You know what? I&amp;#8217;m going to take it as more of a reminder that I should take a break more often and just say, &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;m not going to worry about it.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m disconnected. And it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, but it&amp;#8217;s weird at first though, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, it was so weird because I&amp;#8217;m so used to having my phone with me, whether I&amp;#8217;m using it or not, that if I need to, I can jump in and look at something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I couldn&amp;#8217;t do that suddenly, and it was strange because it was so different from what I was used to, but it was very refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s then that you realize that your phone has become kind of an extension of your mind and body, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, very much so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You don&amp;#8217;t realize it until it&amp;#8217;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: We launched &amp;#8212; just two days ago we launched Migrate DB Pro 1.4 and the CLI add-on, so you can now run migrations from the command line, which his awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And we launched a new design for our site that I did myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I saw that. It looks fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I like that you didn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; it didn&amp;#8217;t radically change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It didn&amp;#8217;t. It really didn&amp;#8217;t, and I did that intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When I first saw your tweet that says, &amp;#8220;Hey, the new design is launched,&amp;#8221; I was out mobile somewhere, and so I pulled it up on my phone real quick to look. Actually, at first I thought it was cached because, since it was mobile, I couldn&amp;#8217;t see all the details to see that it was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I thought about responding like, &amp;#8220;Hey, it&amp;#8217;s not actually live yet, by the way.&amp;#8221; Oh, no &amp;#8212; yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I liked that a lot because it was very subtle and, to me, in some ways it&amp;#8217;s almost more like an iteration and an improvement as opposed to a whole new thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve heard people and, like, designers; they call this a realign rather than a redesign because you&amp;#8217;re just really tweaking things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And making it maybe look a little bit more modern or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But, yeah, most of it is very similar. The big change is really the features page for the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So that&amp;#8217;s the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I did see that, and that was &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s when I was looking at it, and at first I wasn&amp;#8217;t completely sure I was seeing the new design. Then I went into features and went, wait, oh, this is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It looks great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;d spent some time rewriting copy, just stuff that I&amp;#8217;ve kind of picked up in the last 13, 14 months &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; since the last time I redesigned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ve learned a lot in this year and a bit. Yeah, and also we are getting &amp;#8212; Brian Castle and I are starting to organize Big Snow Tiny Conf, which is pretty far away. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s the summertime right now, but we&amp;#8217;re setting dates. We&amp;#8217;re going to do it January 26th to the 29th, so that&amp;#8217;s the week right after PressNomics, so if anyone is flying in from &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Where are you doing that again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: In Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, if anyone is flying in from away for PressNomics, they can just stick around for the next week and hit up some snowboarding with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, well, I&amp;#8217;m going to try and make it up for that because I was pretty sad I couldn&amp;#8217;t make it last year because that sounds awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, man. I hope you can. I hope you can make it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sorry to jump back with quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What&amp;#8217;s new in WP Migrate DB Pro 1.4, aside from the CLI add-on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: There&amp;#8217;s quite a bit. Internationalization is complete, so you can translate the entire thing. That&amp;#8217;s a pretty big addition as well. Then, yeah, obviously the CLI add-on is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Is this the version where you added in the ability to pause migrations, or was that already there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, we did. We did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s such a cool feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You can pause, resume, and cancel. We wrote a whole blog post about that and about all the other features as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Does the pause and resume feature allow you to start a migration, pause it, close the window, come back later and reopen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or is it only while the window is open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s only while the window is open. That would be pretty crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;d be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure if you were storing some sort of persistent data in the database that says this is where we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. No, it&amp;#8217;s really basic. It&amp;#8217;s just using the ajax and JavaScript stuff to keep track of how far along it is and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Still very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s pretty simple and that&amp;#8217;s a good thing because you don&amp;#8217;t want things to be complex because it&amp;#8217;d be more likely to break in the scenario, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But one of the things I&amp;#8217;m most excited about for this release is the compatibility mode thing. I think this might be a first. I&amp;#8217;ve never seen this before, and we spent a lot of time trying to figure out this problem of other plugins that are installed conflicting with our plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Is this where you&amp;#8217;re modifying which plugins can run during your request?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That is so cool. I played with that feature two weeks ago using the beta version, and it seemed to work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, exactly, so just today, for example, a customer was having problems with Polyglot. It was a plugin that does translations. I think that&amp;#8217;s the name of it. What we did is, you just check off the box that says I want to exclude certain plugins for requests that Migrate DB Pro makes, and then you choose the plugins that you don&amp;#8217;t want to run, which should be really all of them in most cases. The only ones you would want to run is if you&amp;#8217;re hooking into Migrate DB Pro or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I think when I tested it I just disabled all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so for that customer, did being able to disable Polyglot fix the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: We already knew it though. We kind of cheated because we knew previously from debugging with them that that&amp;#8217;s what fixed it, disabling that plugin, just manually deactivating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, but it still enforces the need for that option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah, absolutely. And we&amp;#8217;ve had problems with other plugins as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, if you can take care a support request or a problem for a user with that feature, I think it&amp;#8217;s absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. This is almost like a pilot the way we&amp;#8217;ve implemented it because I could see this being just the way it works in the future, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And just not activate any plugins for our requests because it&amp;#8217;s a huge improvement for performance if you have big plugins running like WooCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because WP Migrate DB Pro is such a specialized system and a specialized plugin &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; I wonder if it&amp;#8217;d be, at some point, advantageous to automatically disable all other plugins for your request, but then have a way for plugins to register as WP Migrate DB Pro plugins in a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes. Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Basically a plugin would register support, and if that plugin registers it, you don&amp;#8217;t disable that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because what you don&amp;#8217;t want to do is to automatically disable all plugins and then find out, oh, well, this plugin was supposed to run because it&amp;#8217;s modifying the requests in a way it&amp;#8217;s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. Exactly. And another step, sometimes themes conflict with our requests as well. For example, they might output some errors. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that screws up ajax requests because the ajax requests &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, notices or errors of any kind in ajax are a real pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, because ajax is usually returning json, right, and so it corrupts the json and game over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re going to try to exclude themes as well. But, at the same time, we want to be careful because some people might be using hooks in their theme as well, so we just need to be a little cautious there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. I think this is really, really cool, and I think it shows a lot of not just refinement and polish to the product, which it very clearly does, but I think it also shows that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of experience with really small nuances in development and problems that have been encountered in development over however long you&amp;#8217;ve been developing, so basically in your experience as a developer. I think that this level of a polish and these things that you guys are thinking about shows that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A few weeks ago, we got a cool topic request from Sami from Foxnet Themes who, if you&amp;#8217;re listening, you may remember he was kind enough to sponsor an episode a few months ago. He asked a question about if we would be willing to talk about some of our biggest failures in development as developers. I think this is a really good segue because having that level of refinement, thinking about those deeper issues in development to me indicate that you&amp;#8217;ve had those experiences. You&amp;#8217;ve had some failures where you learned the hard way, maybe, or you learned different things that can really make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you have anything that you would like to share about some of the things that maybe, whether they were failures in development, failures in technique &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; over the last few years, something, anything at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, I&amp;#8217;ve got a pretty good story. It&amp;#8217;s from ages ago. I think it was 2000 or 2001, right, so I don&amp;#8217;t know. Some of you might not have even been born then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I was not writing code then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I was on a coop work term at a company called Smart Force, and they were an e-learning company. I was on the team that was coding up the learning management system. I don&amp;#8217;t know &amp;#8212; my manager asked me to do something, and so I whip something up, and then I sent it off to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wrong, or didn&amp;#8217;t work, or whatever, and he sent it back to me. And so I fixed whatever. I took another crack at it and then sent it back to him again. And then he sent it back to me again. And I did the same thing again, back it came, and that time he lost it at me. He basically reamed me out because I was using him as my tester. He was doing all the testing. I was doing none, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that, I learned &amp;#8212; I still remember this. You know, it&amp;#8217;s been over ten years, and I remember it very clearly that that&amp;#8217;s when I decided, okay, from now on I&amp;#8217;m going to test, you know, and then test again, and then test again myself, right? And I think that has helped me become a better developer, especially when I&amp;#8217;m releasing code because, after that, when I&amp;#8217;d release code and people would come back, it&amp;#8217;s the same kind of thing, right? That&amp;#8217;s a reminder, oh, yes; I should do more testing. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely. That&amp;#8217;s not even necessarily just testing crazy edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s just doing general testing of whatever it is you&amp;#8217;ve built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think there&amp;#8217;s almost an arrogance with developers sometimes. I know there was with me anyway where it&amp;#8217;s like, oh, this is a simple, little fix. I&amp;#8217;m just going to code it cowboy style and then ship it, and there&amp;#8217;s no way there&amp;#8217;d be a bug with that. Right? That&amp;#8217;s the attitude that I used to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s a terrible attitude because there are a lot of times where you&amp;#8217;re going to be wrong there. It may seem like it&amp;#8217;s simple, but it may affect other things that you&amp;#8217;re not thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I learned that lesson the hard way for sure. I learned it mostly in doing plugin support for paying customers where maybe there was a bug in a plugin or I was doing a little bit of custom work for them or something. And so I would log into their site and fix it in line editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Uh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And hit update. And guess what? White screen. And, unfortunately, when I was first learning that that&amp;#8217;s just a terrible way to do it, especially if you have alternatives, was before WordPress would do a check and look for fatal errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if you fatal error a plugin, guess what? The site is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know how many customer sites I killed by doing that. More than I care to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yeah. I mean that&amp;#8217;s how you learn that it&amp;#8217;s a bad thing. Right? You know, people are going to hear us saying these things, and this might be the way they operate right now. But at some point something is going to go terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What&amp;#8217;s interesting, I don&amp;#8217;t think anybody is ever going to be &amp;#8212; I mean, at least I hope. Most reasonable developers are not likely to go and try and claim that it&amp;#8217;s smart to do it this way, to jump in with cowboy coding like that and just run untested code. But what I think a lot of developers that do do it, they fail to see where it&amp;#8217;s really a problem. I think they&amp;#8217;ll acknowledge that it&amp;#8217;s probably not the best idea if they alternatives, sure. But is it really a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it&amp;#8217;s something that people have to learn for themselves. You can have someone tell you over and over, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t do it this way. Here is something better.&amp;#8221; But it&amp;#8217;s not really going to sink in until you have that unfortunate experience where your boss just reams you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or you have that experience where you kill a customer site and they&amp;#8217;re furious with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: In order for some of those practices to really set in, I think you have to learn trial by fire sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And there&amp;#8217;s a really great way of doing that is by releasing code on .org or &amp;#8212; yeah, I mean that&amp;#8217;s a great way because if you update the plugin there and, you know, a few hundred people, maybe, let&amp;#8217;s say, get the update, and it&amp;#8217;s taken down their site, they&amp;#8217;re not going to be happy. They&amp;#8217;re going to let you know. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I mean, unless you just don&amp;#8217;t care at all, it&amp;#8217;s going to affect you in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And most likely it&amp;#8217;s going to make you think, okay, I don&amp;#8217;t want to repeat that experience, so what do I do now to ensure that I don&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. Yep. And, I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re selling something, if you&amp;#8217;re selling a plugin, you release it, and it breaks, I think that&amp;#8217;s even worse because there&amp;#8217;s an expectation from customers that what you&amp;#8217;re shipping is going to work that&amp;#8217;s been tested really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And might have even been released as a beta previously. So I think releasing code that you&amp;#8217;re selling is also another good way to do this. There&amp;#8217;s a different dynamic at work there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, certainly. I know that I learned the hard way from, like, the importance of testing, and I&amp;#8217;ve struggled with this with some people. Actually, I think any time that you work with other people, you struggle with it because if anyone ever commits something without testing it, and then you find a bug, you inherently want to say, like, &amp;#8220;Well, why didn&amp;#8217;t you just test this more?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I think we have to be careful about maybe accusing other people of that because, if we look back on it, we realize I either do that or I did it that way for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly, exactly. I mean, sometimes the bug &amp;#8212; maybe they did test it, right? Maybe they just missed it. That&amp;#8217;s also a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, you can&amp;#8217;t be too quick to judge, for sure, when it comes to code. There are a lot of hang-ups, so anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. But I like the idea; I like going back and looking at mistakes that we&amp;#8217;ve made as developers and looking at how they&amp;#8217;ve absolutely influenced how we work today. I think, for you, some of that is very evident in the way that you build WP Migrate DB Pro and the level of polish, some of the things that you think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if anybody else would like to share stories that they have, we would love to hear them. I know every developer who has built anything has a failure story at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Absolutely. And if you don&amp;#8217;t, you&amp;#8217;re lying. You&amp;#8217;re a dirty liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s okay if you don&amp;#8217;t ever want to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, I&amp;#8217;m not going to lie. Some of the things that I did early on made me cringe so much that I would rather they never be known to the world, but &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, I mean, you live and learn, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Did you want to talk about Airplane Mode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;d like to give a little shout out to Mr. Andrew Norcross quickly. He wrote a little plugin recently called Airplane Mode. You can find it on GitHub if you go to github.com/norcross. You can also find it on Post Status. Brian Krogsgard wrote up a little post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a cool, little development tool if you do a lot of traveling, and you don&amp;#8217;t have Wi-Fi on the plane, or you do a lot of local development where you don&amp;#8217;t have Wi-Fi, or maybe your Wi-Fi goes out four days, as mine did recently. Whatever reason, if you don&amp;#8217;t have an Internet connection, sometimes working in WordPress can be kind of painful because there are a lot of remote requests that run, actually, everything from Gravitar to Google fonts to a couple of other things as well like update checks to .org, for example. Sometimes they fail nicely, sometimes they don&amp;#8217;t, sometimes they just slow down because they&amp;#8217;re waiting for HTTP requests to time out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, this is a little plugin that Norcross wrote that the idea is the same way that you turn your phone into airplane mode, which disables all of the outgoing and incoming signals. You can do the same thing with your WordPress by using this plugin, and it will deactivate certain HTTP requests, deactivate update checks, deactivate Gravitar and any remove resources. And so it&amp;#8217;s a cool, little plugin, so go check it out. It&amp;#8217;s one of the ones that I really like, not necessarily just because of what it does, but because it&amp;#8217;s solving a development problem, which I think solving problems in your development is really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Building products and building tools is cool too, but then running into problems when you&amp;#8217;re building those things and saying, oh, well, let me build something else that fixes that problem. I think this is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Cool. I&amp;#8217;m going to check this out because I was just recently in this situation. I think it was on an airplane or something. What I ended up doing is downloading the open sans font that I needed to my local machine and then just commenting out the link, whatever, the link tag that includes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What I&amp;#8217;ve done a few times that also works kind of is if you turn your Wi-Fi off. For whatever reason, that actually works as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But if you don&amp;#8217;t turn the Wi-Fi off on your computer, it freaks out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Huh. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but apparently all of the HTTP requests fail instantly if Wi-Fi is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: At least in OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So, anyway, it&amp;#8217;s a cool, little plugin. Thanks, Mr. Norcross, for taking the time to write that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, for sure. So I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing a lot about commoditization of WordPress themes. I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing it since, I think, PressNomics this past October or maybe even before, and I&amp;#8217;m still baffled that I have no idea what it means. Do you understand what people mean when they say that WordPress themes are becoming commodities? Does that make any sense to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, yes and no. Initially &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t really agree with the title because, in a way, I think WordPress themes are designed to be products that are plug and play. You purchase it, you turn it on, and you&amp;#8217;re done. To me, that is kind of the definition of a commodity in some way, I mean if you look up the literal definition of a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;m going to look it up right now. Here is it: A raw material or primary agricultural product that could be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee; a useful or valuable thing, such as water or time. Hmm. It&amp;#8217;s pretty ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s a very different definition than I read. But I think the overall argument with it regardless, I guess, of what semantics tell us is that WordPress themes are in some way maybe using some of their&amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, if you hire a designer, and you hire a development team to build you a custom website, one of the things that you&amp;#8217;re getting is supposedly a very unique setup, a very unique design, the layout, etc., or that&amp;#8217;s the plan, a specialized one, whereas a theme is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Widely used. Just as an example, take the Avada theme. Everyone sees the Avada theme, and they know that&amp;#8217;s Avada. Kind of like when you see 2012, you know that&amp;#8217;s 2012. And I think that&amp;#8217;s where some people are getting into saying that these themes, when they say that they&amp;#8217;re becoming much more of a commodity. Now, to be honest, I don&amp;#8217;t pay as much attention to the theme world, so I may be completely wrong on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, you and me both. We probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t even be &amp;#8212; we&amp;#8217;re probably not qualified to even talk about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We&amp;#8217;re not the right people to talk about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But to me that word &amp;#8220;commodity&amp;#8221;, to me I think of &amp;#8212; the first thing I think of is the financial report on the business channel where they&amp;#8217;re talking about the price of crude and how it&amp;#8217;s fluctuating and gold. Right? And the difference between those things and a theme, if you kind of &amp;#8212; well, there&amp;#8217;s obviously differences. But if you&amp;#8217;re just thinking about it financially, I mean no one&amp;#8211; If I buy gold tomorrow, no one is going to give me support or service for that gold. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s a good that I can use as currency, basically, right? I don&amp;#8217;t see people buying up themes to ward off the Great Depression. That&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s why I just don&amp;#8217;t understand how it&amp;#8217;s a commodity, how these things are a commodity. If WordPress themes all of a sudden had no support, like if you didn&amp;#8217;t have to support them and you could trade them as currency then, yeah, I would be like, oh, yeah, they&amp;#8217;re definitely commodities. But that&amp;#8217;s not happening any time soon. I don&amp;#8217;t see that ever happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: When is there going to be a day where a theme is never going to require support, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There is an interesting discussion on WP Tavern. It started yesterday. Jeff Chandler wrote a post titled: Are the days of paying less than $100 for a WordPress theme over? And it was basically a list of a bunch of different articles that have talked about the state of the WordPress theme industry, are WordPress themes a commodity, on selling them, prices of themes, things with the GPL in themes, and a whole bunch of other articles that have been recently published about selling themes and the theme market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was brought up in the discussion of the article is how a theme, the definition of a theme should be something that you can just install, turn on, and you&amp;#8217;re done. When you purchase a theme, there really shouldn&amp;#8217;t be any after-purchase support. There shouldn&amp;#8217;t be. There shouldn&amp;#8217;t need to be is what several people like Chris Wallace were saying based upon the way that a theme works and what a theme is designed to do. Unfortunately, that&amp;#8217;s not really the case. I mean, as any theme company knows or anybody that&amp;#8217;s ever sold themes or anybody who has ever sold plugins even knows that there&amp;#8217;s a huge amount of customer support involved with themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I like what Chris is saying though in his article that the way they&amp;#8217;re building their themes now, they&amp;#8217;re really minimizing the possibilities of them having to provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They&amp;#8217;re trying to attain that goal where you don&amp;#8217;t have support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Where you don&amp;#8217;t need it. And I love that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But I think the only way that that&amp;#8217;s going to &amp;#8212; you know, you can get the percentage down, right, like you can say we really decreased our support requests, right? But to get it down to zero, I think you&amp;#8217;re going to have to pretty much ban plugins, right, because plugins are going to affect your theme regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely. The thing is, you have 40,000 plugins out there. There&amp;#8217;s going to be a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think this is why WordPress.com doesn&amp;#8217;t have nearly as much theme support. But what&amp;#8217;s interesting is that even on WordPress.com, the theme authors still do customer support questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What I mean is that even in a setup where you don&amp;#8217;t have plugins at all &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s still customer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And it&amp;#8217;s not just plugins. I mean that environment is highly restricted, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Those themes are almost completely different, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Now I would suspect that the kind of customer support questions you get on .com are completely different than on a self-hosted theme site simply because there&amp;#8217;s not nearly as many variables that come into play. I would love to see if Chris Wallace &amp;#8212; I know you&amp;#8217;re the person that said that where I read that comment, so if you&amp;#8217;re listening to this, by the way, I&amp;#8217;d love to know what kind of questions you get, or anybody else who sells themes on .com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m kind of intrigued by that. Are they questions about, hey, I don&amp;#8217;t know how to change a color? I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;d be very interested to hear what those are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I bet&amp;#8217;cha they&amp;#8217;re very different. That would be my guess is that they&amp;#8217;re quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: My guess is they&amp;#8217;re very different and that they&amp;#8217;re probably much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. At what point are the theme authors &amp;#8212; so WordPress.com must provide their own support for the platform, so at what point does the support request get kind of offloaded on the theme author?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which…? Yeah, I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. See, we need to have someone one to talk about this, clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. There&amp;#8217;s a good topic for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Some of the comments on the WP Tavern post, I mean the idea was: are we going to stop paying less than $100 for themes? A couple of people said, &amp;#8220;You know what? If I get a well coded theme that just works, I have no problem paying $100 for a theme versus $30.&amp;#8221; Other people brought up the point that, well, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be paying for good quality versus bad quality because, if you&amp;#8217;re buying something, it should be good quality, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which I think is a very fair point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean right now a lot of that cost &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: In other words, your theme shouldn&amp;#8217;t be priced higher because it&amp;#8217;s minimal and good quality as opposed to somebody who is priced lower just because it&amp;#8217;s poorer quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s kind of a crappy way to do pricing, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I don&amp;#8217;t know. It depends. I don&amp;#8217;t know. For me, like Chris Wallace&amp;#8217;s article was excellent because he was talking about niche themes and stuff like that, and I think that he has a great point there that that&amp;#8217;s really how things are going. And I think, if you are building a niche them that&amp;#8217;s kind specialized, right, then I think something like that does warrant a higher price tag because it&amp;#8217;s a specialized thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Certainly, but the price is based upon the focus of the theme, not how well you wrote your CSS in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s basically what one guy was pointing out in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: In general, I think I completely agree with him. Now that does not mean that I am &amp;#8212; okay, let me put it this way. I am much happier paying a premium for a quality theme than I am paying the same price or less for a less quality theme. But are you &amp;#8212; was the price of that theme from the author determined to be higher because it was a better CSS or better PHP? Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I&amp;#8217;m not even going to talk about pricing because pricing is really crazy. I mean there&amp;#8217;s psychology around pricing. If you have a higher price, some people will come to you purely because they believe that a higher price will get them higher quality, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Which is not necessarily the case. You might just be higher priced because the guy arbitrarily chose a higher price. So, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m not even going to start getting into that. Should we talk about TimThumb and the crazy security alert?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Let&amp;#8217;s mention that real quick. Anybody who didn&amp;#8217;t know, TimThumb has been, unfortunately, once again, discovered to have a major security flaw in it. Did you read about it, what the flaw does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I haven&amp;#8217;t even read a thing about it. I just saw it and was like, eh, that&amp;#8217;s old news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The good news is that the flaw only affects people that have actually turned on a specific feature that is disabled by default, which is good. It doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily affect every single person using TimThumb. However, if it&amp;#8217;s enabled, it&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s called their Web shot feature. If it is enabled, it allows someone to execute a pretty simple command to execute any arbitrary PHP they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s a pretty big deal. Somebody actually showed an example of how it works, and it&amp;#8217;s basically a single request to the TimThumb file, and it allows you to, I think, basically put in either the location of a PHP file or put in straight PHP and then execute that. Once you can do that, you can do anything you want, so it&amp;#8217;s a pretty big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: TimThumb, unfortunately, has a pretty negative history of having some vulnerabilities in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is kind of unfortunate because I think the script itself is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think the big problem with TimThumb is that it gets bundled into things, and then it never gets updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And never updated, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, whereas WordPress has a fair number of vulnerabilities that come out, but they get dealt with really quickly and updated quickly, whereas TimThumb is not necessarily easy to do that, right? For example, if TimThumb was included with your theme, well, does updating TimThumb bust your theme? Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So it&amp;#8217;s really up to the theme author to update TimThumb and then do a new release, and sometimes that just doesn&amp;#8217;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then hope that every single one of your customers or users update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which we both know as a reality is not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: There are a lot of things that are probably not going to work out in that whole string of events there, right? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That alone is one of the reasons that I try to avoid scripts like TimThumb or external libraries that are not necessarily going to be vulnerable, but that you do need to keep updated and be very aware of. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that you should avoid them. I&amp;#8217;m just saying that you should be very cautious about just including them just because they&amp;#8217;re nice or that they solve a problem. You have to think about the bigger picture of, okay, what if this fails? What are we going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. The sequence of events we just discussed, we&amp;#8217;re talking about TimThumb, but it could be a different script that was bundled with the theme that has a vulnerability that isn&amp;#8217;t getting updated, right? It&amp;#8217;s really a symptom of that whole process. Yeah, I don&amp;#8217;t know. I think the onus is on the theme author to make sure that they update their libraries that they&amp;#8217;re including and then get those updates out to their customers and get them updated, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Unfortunately, you&amp;#8217;re not going to be able to get every single customer updated because either some people aren&amp;#8217;t going to see the notifications, they&amp;#8217;re not going to read and figure out why it&amp;#8217;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But as product creators, it is our responsibility to at least ensure that we&amp;#8217;ve done everything that we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep, absolutely. Cool. Well, so we don&amp;#8217;t have any new iTunes reviews, but we would love to get some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If you are consuming this podcast through iTunes, if you could just go on there and click on that right most star for us, that would be cool. We&amp;#8217;d appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think that pretty much wraps us up for the day, but I would love to send out another invite to anybody that wants to tell us about a development failure that has affected how they work today or things that they keep in mind, whether it&amp;#8217;s how much you test or the way that you work, the tools you use, etc. I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about those. And I think it&amp;#8217;s something that I would also love to have ongoing throughout Apply Filters because I think learning from failures is one of the best ways that we get better as developers. And so if that&amp;#8217;s myself or Brad telling a story of where we failed or hearing from the listeners and then sharing that story, I think we can all learn from other people&amp;#8217;s mistakes as well, so anybody who wants to share, here&amp;#8217;s an open invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Absolutely. To do that, it&amp;#8217;s probably best to submit a topic idea, so go to ApplyFilters.fm, click submit topic idea in the header, fill out that form, and we&amp;#8217;ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep. You&amp;#8217;re also welcome to leave a comment on one of the episodes, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Either method will work fine. However you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Depends if you want this public or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. By the way, if you want to tell us a story, let us know if you want your information publicly released or not. We have no problem keeping things private, but we will also mention who it came from if you would like us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Thanks, everybody, for listening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

INTRO: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

BRAD Yes, I am Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my co-host Pippin Williamson. Say hello, Pippin.

PIPPIN: Hello.

BRAD: This is Episode 20, and in this episode we are going to be talking about our biggest failures in our WordPress development or just development in generally, really. And then were going to get into some news items. Lets talk first about what weve been up to. What have you been up to, Pippin?

PIPPIN: Well, first of all, I took a vacation recently for the first time in a while, like a true vacation where I actually shut down and didnt do any work or very little work. I went up to Canada to visit some family.

BRAD: Dear God, Canada!

PIPPIN: Yeah! I know there are some crazy people up there.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: But I was right there on Lake Ontario outside of Toronto, and it was a beautiful little area. But it was really nice to kind of shut down for a little bit. And then I came home after being up there for about five or six days and immediately started working on a new add-on for Affiliate WP for tracking recurring referrals.

Ever since Affiliate WP was launched, one of the biggest feature requests weve gotten was the ability to have recurring referrals so that you can reward affiliates commissions on a lifetime of a customer. So if a customer signs up for your membership, and then they pay you a monthly fee or a yearly fee, that affiliate can gain a referral on every payment that they make for the lifetime of the customer.

BRAD: Right, because right now they only get the first, the very first sale.

PIPPIN: Right, they would get the first one.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: So lets say they sign up for a $20 monthly payment and you get a 20% commission, so you get --

BRAD: $4.

PIPPIN: Yeah, exactly. You get $4.

BRAD: And thats it.

PIPPIN: Well, so now instead, if somebody signs up for a $20 monthly payment and is a member for 4 years, that affiliate has now just received a much larger earning.

BRAD: Right, whatever that comes out to. Im not that quick at math.

PIPPIN: Yeah. Im not going to try and do the math in my head. Ill fail. But anyway, so I was working on that add-on for it, which is an add-on available to our developer license holders that adds support for that for WooCommerce subscriptions, my Restrict Content Pro plugin, the membership add</itunes:summary>

INTRO:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Now here&amp;#8217;s your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hello!  I am Pippin Williamson, and joining me as usual is Brad Touesnard.  Say hello, Brad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Hey, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Welcome to Episode 19 of Apply Filters.  Today we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about a lot of different things that we&amp;#8217;ve been involved with recently, both projects, events, things going on in the community, et cetera, and it shouldn&amp;#8217;t fill up our whole episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right before we get into that, we want to mention our sponsorship again, which comes from WP Ninjas and their recent product Ninja Demo.  They&amp;#8217;re getting ready to push out a new version that has some cool, new features on it.  If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with Ninja Demo, go to ninjademo.com and check it out.  It is one of the only options available to easily create a demo environment for your WordPress themes or your plugins where potential customers can sign up in just seconds to get a dedicated demo where they can really give your product a test drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s cool.  That&amp;#8217;s one thing I didn&amp;#8217;t really realize when they first launched is that each time a user starts a demo, it&amp;#8217;s private.  You know, not everyone else could see what they&amp;#8217;re doing and stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s super cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	One thing that I think is really cool about it is because it&amp;#8217;s private &amp;#8212; the way that it works is you have a multisite install and then, when you generate a demo, it creates a new site within that multisite.  Then that user gets access to that site, which means that, depending on how you have it set up, you could give them access to edit any content they want.  So if you&amp;#8217;re demoing, say, an e-commerce plugin, you could allow them to create products, test sales, et cetera, and it wouldn&amp;#8217;t affect anyone else&amp;#8217;s demo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;s a pretty slick system.  We&amp;#8217;re using it on Affiliate WP right now, and it&amp;#8217;s working really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.  So, man, where have you been?  You&amp;#8217;ve been kicking around somewhere on a coast, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve been traveling a lot over the last week, mostly because I traveled to Oregon all of last week for BeachPress 2.0, which was this really cool event put on by Justin Sainton.  Basically the idea was to get 20 to 30 people from the WordPress community and put them in a house on the beach for a week and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That sounds terrible.  What a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, it was amazing.  It was really cool.  It was very much a &amp;#8212; it was kind of like an un-conference.  The idea was to have everybody come together, stay together in this house, and see how it works out.  So it was really a co-working situation where everybody was kind of doing their own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Since we were there for a full, I think, five days, there wasn&amp;#8217;t any of the normal tension that you might have from trying to get the scheduled events happening and make sure that everything happens on time to the schedule and that everybody gets their money&amp;#8217;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  There is a schedule to BeachPress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We had a little bit of a schedule.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was kind of &amp;#8212; it was more of the: hey, on this day we&amp;#8217;re going to try and do some lightening talks.  On this day anybody who wants to is going to go tour a brewery.  That was kind of it.  There wasn&amp;#8217;t a very rigid schedule that says, okay, at 1:00 p.m. on this day Justin is going to talk about his WP Commerce work, and on this day Ben Lobaugh is going to talk about JetPack.  No, it was very casual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It was a bunch of great &amp;#8212; you know, you just get a bunch of great people in a room and see what happens kind of thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it was awesome.  A lot of people &amp;#8212; everybody was able to take the time to have their normal day-to-day meetings or do a little bit of their day-to-day work, so like I managed support tickets while I was there, pushed out a couple plugin version, but we had a lot of time to not just get to know each other, but get to work with each other too, and so that was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Who was your favorite person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Justin.  Justin Sainton is my favorite person for putting it on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.  That was on the Oregon coast, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it was just about like an hour and a half to the southwest of Portland.  I don&amp;#8217;t know my Oregon geography very well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it was right on the coast, so we just had a really big house that was just located &amp;#8212; I mean, we were 100 feet from the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;ve heard good things about the Oregon coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was chilly, but it was beautiful &amp;#8212; at least chilly for me.  I mean, I&amp;#8217;m from Kansas, and right now it&amp;#8217;s 95 to 100 degrees every day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Going down to where it was like 45 at night and 60 during the day was a little bit different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, no doubt.  Are you &amp;#8212; you got some other WordCamps on the horizon, don&amp;#8217;t you, or not other WordCamps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple coming up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Word Camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple different events.  I&amp;#8217;m traveling all of next week just for, I think, the first actual vacation that I&amp;#8217;ve taken.  I&amp;#8217;ve done a lot of traveling recently, but not just for fun.  Tomorrow, I&amp;#8217;m flying to Canada to go visit family.  But beyond that, we&amp;#8217;ve got WordCamp Kansas City coming up in July, and then WordCamp New York is at the beginning of August, and WordCamp Omaha is in the middle of August, and I&amp;#8217;ll be going to all three of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Are you traveling at all any time soon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	No.  I play ultimate Frisbee during the summer, competitively.  We travel all over the place.  I&amp;#8217;m going to be in Boston next weekend, and then Ottawa next month, and then for nationals, Canadian nationals in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s a pretty full schedule during the summer, so I can&amp;#8217;t really fly.  I think my wife would kill me if I did any more traveling than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And then we&amp;#8217;re expecting our second child in September, so kind of write off &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hey, you&amp;#8217;re just ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, is that right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re expecting our second in October and so, after WordCamp Omaha, I&amp;#8217;m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m taking the next like four months off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m pretty much writing off everything up to Big Snow Tiny Conf in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Something that was fun about BeachPress because it was so casual, I mean aside from just getting to know a lot of people, meeting new friends, and getting back together with old friends.  Because of how casual it was, we were able to do some good co-working, and so there were two things for me that came out of it.  One, we managed to get some nice traction on some WordPress Trac tickets, which was cool.  But we also managed to get EDD version 2.0 pushed out finally, which kind of made me happy.  That&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the last, like, four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And managed to not push out a point release the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Achievement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	My last four releases have had, like, a point release pushed out either with a day or within 36 hours because of something that we found, and so this is the first time in, I think, six months that we haven&amp;#8217;t had a point release after a major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I mean, that&amp;#8217;s pretty typical of the big projects anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, I think it&amp;#8217;s really typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Any time that you have a release, whether it&amp;#8217;s a plugin or WordPress Core or a giant theme that you have been working on for six months, there&amp;#8217;s some little thing that&amp;#8217;s going to slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is why I have no problem pushing out a point release because I&amp;#8217;m much more interested in making sure that we get problems fixed than we annoy people because they installed two updates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, and a lot of people will hold off for like a week before they install that update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah, and so even if you do push out a point release on the same day, the number of people that are going to have to install both is pretty low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly, yeah.  That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of, you know, correcting those little issues immediately.  It&amp;#8217;s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Cool!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Something else that was kind of cool with BeachPress, I managed to get a new plugin written called Batch Comment Spam Deletion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I ran into a problem.  It actually occurred to me, like, as I was flying to BeachPress.  I was sitting there on the plane with plane Wi-Fi, was logged into my site, and I noticed that I had 43,000 comments in spam.  Yeah.  I mean, they just built up over a couple of months, and they were all there.  I was like, you know, I should clear these out.  There&amp;#8217;s no reason for these to sit here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Are you using a Kismet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.  And they still sit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The Kismet does not work on my site right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t know why.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t.  I mean it catches them in terms of in that it gets them, puts them into spam, but it&amp;#8217;s not auto deleting anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But anyway, so I had 43,000 spam comments sitting there.  And, okay, I should clear these out.  So I click &amp;#8220;empty spam&amp;#8221;.  Well, if you&amp;#8217;ve ever tried to delete 43,000 spam comments, it kills your server.  I mean it just slaughters it because the way that the &amp;#8220;empty spam&amp;#8221; function in WordPress work is it actually performs a query to get all of the IDs, every single comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, boy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So it does a select var on the comment post ID.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It gets all of the comment IDs, and then it loops through every single one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, dear God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And calls WP delete comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Why does it do this this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I was thinking about it because I was thinking this seems really silly, and I realized that some of it probably has to do with the fact of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	WP delete comment fires the hooks that you might want, which is pretty important.  It also deletes all comment meta associated with the comment.  And so at first I was a little peeved to see that that was how it worked.  Then I realized, oh, wait; actually it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The problem is it simply doesn&amp;#8217;t scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I decided to attack it with a plugin, so I wrote a little plugin that replaces the &amp;#8220;empty spam&amp;#8221; function with one that processes it in batches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so it&amp;#8217;ll do a batch of 100 at a time, and then it just iterates through them.  So it does 100, and it does another 100, and it does another 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	How did you accomplish that?  Did you use just ajax requests to batch them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I didn&amp;#8217;t do it with ajax.  I would like to maybe do a version 2.0 that uses ajax because it would be cleaner.  It would be better for the user.  What this does is it uses a step procedure and does a redirect, and so it deletes 100, redirects, deletes 100, redirects.  And it does it in such a way that it will never cause a redirect loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it will successfully delete 100,000 spam comments without killing any server or without failing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Or timing out, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It will take a little while, but it will do it.  And so that was fun, and that was something (indiscernible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Timeouts are the other issue there, right, because if you&amp;#8217;re running something like, you know, Nginx, for instance, it doesn&amp;#8217;t respect the set timeout PHP function.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right, so in this case it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what your set timeout is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, that&amp;#8217;s what I mean, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	As long as the server has the ability to delete 100 comments at a time, which is not hard to do&amp;#8211;I mean, that&amp;#8217;s a pretty small request in terms of the timeout speed&amp;#8211;it will never fail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  No, I meant before your plugin if you just did &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, before it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, certainly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You would definitely get a timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	In my case, when I ran into the issue, I was able to delete about 1,000 comments at a time before it would just timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  That&amp;#8217;s funny.  And then you could end up with like partial &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So yeah, so that was the plugin I wrote.  I wrote it at BeachPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You could end up with like partial data there too, right?  Like you could end up &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like it could delete the meta &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Like you might have a comment that was deleted, but the meta wasn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which actually I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure has happened to me because I recently migrated my personal site from one host to another and, when I was doing that migration, I noticed that my comment meta table was enormous.  I mean, it was like ten times larger that the rest of the database combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think a lot of it was actually because of comment meta that was left over from comments that had been deleted, probably because of that exact problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, yeah, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that was something else that came out of BeachPress that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, anyway, what have you been doing recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, we have been getting Migrate DB Pro 1.4 beta out with the CLI add-on, so you&amp;#8217;re able to &amp;#8212; this is all beta right now, but we haven&amp;#8217;t gotten any bugs reported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I migrated a live site with it a couple days ago with the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s awesome.  And it worked, so that&amp;#8217;s good.  We&amp;#8217;ve got a pretty rigorous testing system that we go through or process, I guess I would call it.  And so, yeah, it seems to be in a good spot, so our testing seems to be working pretty well.  But anyway, the CLI add-on allows you to run migrations using WP-CLI, so you can just run a command from the command line and give it the profile ID that you&amp;#8217;ve set up using the GUI.  And it&amp;#8217;ll just run that migration from the command line.  So you can do things like set up a Cron job to run overnight and migrate, you know, get the latest live database down to your local dev environment.  Then when you get to your machine in the morning, it&amp;#8217;s like ready to go, you know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That is cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s been our biggest request, feature request, is just being able to automate their migrations, and so people are pretty pumped for this, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s really awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So if you sign up for, you know, if you get a license for Migrate DB Pro right now, you can get the beta.  Just download it from my account, so it&amp;#8217;s not like an exclusive thing or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s what I saw the other day because I was installing a new &amp;#8212; I was downloading a new version to install on the site that I was migrating.  And I noticed the beta, so I went ahead and tried it, and it was awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  That&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It worked.  I mean, I didn&amp;#8217;t notice any issues.  Everything worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  You were having problems with, like, a CDN at one point or something.  CloudFlare, I think you said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I think CloudFlare was causing those problems.  It was interesting because we pushed it up.  I had it on the dev site, and then I pushed it over to the live site.  The idea was, I was going to pull from the dev to the live.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And, for some reason, CloudFlare actually cached one of the JavaScript files.  Well, it cached a minified version and, during the minification process, it broke some function in the JavaScript file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then it cached that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it took me an hour and a half to get that cache cleared out.  There&amp;#8217;s something about the CloudFlare caching system that is just ridiculously hard to overwrite.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s just because I fail miserably at something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	No, I&amp;#8217;ve heard that cache invalidation is an extremely difficult problem when you&amp;#8217;re talking about a CDN.  I have no idea of how it works, like the inner workings of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I have no idea, but it took us forever to get it figured out.  Eventually we got it.  Then once we cleared it out, everything worked great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I run Amazon CloudFront on my blog just kind of as an experiment to experiment with a CDN.  Every once in a while I have to run a cache invalidation there, and it takes like five minutes to ten minutes to run this invalidation.  And we&amp;#8217;re talking about just invalidating one CSS file; it takes this long.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, and this was just a JavaScript file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean it was tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like I said, I don&amp;#8217;t understand what&amp;#8217;s going on in the background there, but I&amp;#8217;ve heard it&amp;#8217;s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I don&amp;#8217;t really know, but it was interesting because, for the longest time, I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that it was a cache problem, and so I was sitting here like why is this erroring out?  This server is identical to dev; the same plugin.  I&amp;#8217;m looking at the file on the server and it&amp;#8217;s still breaking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Brad, help me.  Oh, not your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But we used it to launch a new site.  My brother runs a company called CG Cookie, and it&amp;#8217;s an education site for 3-D modeling, concept art, and things like that.  Anyway, so the software that they run on is called Blender 3-D, which is another open source project similar to WordPress, but something that Blender 3-D does not have is the commercial sphere that WordPress has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So Blender 3-D is like a desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	For doing 3-D modeling.  Is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, 3-D modeling, animation, texturing, things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So it can be used for games, movies, advertisement, what have you, lots of different things.  But so Blender is kind of &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s in the same kind of position is WordPress is in terms of the way that the project works.  It&amp;#8217;s all open source.  But they don&amp;#8217;t have that commercial sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So if you think about, like, look at WordPress five years ago when commercial products were really just starting to come about.  There were a lot of people that were pretty against it.  A lot of people saying things like, well, how can you sell an open source plugin?  How can you make money off of this?  This is wrong &amp;#8212; things like that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what was cool about this new site that I helped my brother launch earlier this week is that it&amp;#8217;s the first commercial marketplace for Blender software for add-ons and things like that.  And so it was fun to launch this project.  It&amp;#8217;s called Blender Markets or cgcookiemarkets.com.  It was cool, for one, because I was able to work with my own stuff, so it&amp;#8217;s all powered by Easy Digital Downloads and some of our extensions, as well as Affiliate WP and a couple other plugins.  It was cool for that, but it was also cool because I got to have a new look where we used to be in WordPress because they are in that exact spot that we were five years ago with commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Do they have &amp;#8212; so does Blender have the equivalent of the WordPress.org repo where they&amp;#8217;ve got like free stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s an official repository.  There are definitely a lot of sites that do have their own little repositories, but I don&amp;#8217;t know if there&amp;#8217;s one specifically, like an official one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so there is definitely not really a way for people to get their products out there aside from their own site.  And so think of something like CodeCanyon and The Envato Marketplaces, which has been huge for a ton of people to get into the commercial sphere for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Some people have done it very successfully, others maybe not as successful.  Some people opted to stay there.  Some people moved off of Envato.  But this new site is basically the Envato for Blender, and I think it&amp;#8217;ll be really cool to see them transform and see the open source community around Blender transform into something similar to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother actually sends me discussions that they have all the time where somebody mentions a commercial product and people were like, oh, well, how dare you sell a commercial plugin.  That&amp;#8217;s just not right to sell an open source project.  And then he always points to WordPress and be like, look; this is the same system.  It&amp;#8217;s an open source project that has a really vibrant, commercial sphere.  Why is this any different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so Blender Market, cgcookiemarkets.com is the site that we just launched that I&amp;#8217;m really excited to watch and see what that does.  That&amp;#8217;s what we used WP Migrate DB Pro for was to move to launch their live version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s cool.  Did you&amp;#8211;?  So I see that it redirects when you go to cgcookieamericas.com.  It redirects.  What&amp;#8217;s up with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It goes to /blender, the reason being, so their main network of sites, which is cgcookie.com, it&amp;#8217;s a big multisite install.  Then they have cgcookie.com/blender, cgcookie.com/max, and so they have all of these different sites dedicated to different kinds of software or to topics.  They have one called /concept, which is concept art.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so cgcookie.com/markets is going to be the same thing.  They&amp;#8217;re going to be launching marketplaces for other software as well, such as like 3-D … max or maybe for like concept art, which would be like Photoshop add-ons and things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But Blender Market is the first one, so they&amp;#8217;re just sending everybody there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s cool.  Yeah.  Did they do like a big release for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right now it&amp;#8217;s kind of a soft release, so they haven&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There hasn&amp;#8217;t been a lot of marketing push on it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But they&amp;#8217;re going to be doing that pretty soon.  The first few days we&amp;#8217;re kind of like, hey, let&amp;#8217;s get it live and make sure that we don&amp;#8217;t cause any major problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Is that what your brother does, he does CG stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay, cool.  Does he still do that, or is this his full time thing now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, he does it full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Something that&amp;#8217;s also kind of cool that they&amp;#8217;re doing with the site &amp;#8212; I might have to rescue my daughter in just a second &amp;#8212; is that they&amp;#8217;re actually using the site to help fund the development of the core software where authors can actually sign up, and they can give a proceed of their commissions to the Blender development fund.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that was a fun little feature that I got to build for Easy Digital Downloads where an author can submit their product, and they can say yes; I want to contribute to the fund.  Here&amp;#8217;s the percentage I want to contribute.  Then it calculates all of those things automatically and donates that money to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is kind of cool.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Totally.  Right on.  Something else I&amp;#8217;ve been working on that&amp;#8217;s been taking up a lot of my time just recently is I&amp;#8217;ve been redesigning DeliciousBrains.com because, I mean, it hasn&amp;#8217;t been redesigned since we launched over a year ago, and we&amp;#8217;ve changed quite a bit since then.  The product has changed a lot.  Like, for instance, there was nowhere for add-ons to go, really, because we didn&amp;#8217;t have add-ons when we started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So we kind of have to, I have to re-jig things to make room for them.  And so that&amp;#8217;s, you know, been taking up a lot of my time.  I&amp;#8217;ve been kind of wondering if I should have hired someone to do this.  Before I started, I was thinking of hiring someone.  But now that I&amp;#8217;ve gotten into it, I&amp;#8217;ve realized it&amp;#8217;s a good thing I didn&amp;#8217;t because there are so many little things that I realize after, like as I&amp;#8217;m designing, as I&amp;#8217;m doing this and that, like oh, yeah, I remember that customer saying this.  You know, and so all these things are influencing where, how I lay things out, how I structure things, and what copy I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Are you thinking of &amp;#8212; so right now you have Delicious Brains.  It&amp;#8217;s the Delicious Brains website, and then there&amp;#8217;s a page for WP Migrate DB Pro, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	A section, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Are you restructuring it so that WP Migrate DB Pro is the focus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I am, but it&amp;#8217;s still going to be under DeliciousBrains.com because we will be launching additional products this year, and so we&amp;#8217;re just going to launch them under the same umbrella site.  If you go to deliciousbrains.com/wpmigratedbpro, it&amp;#8217;s going to look a little bit different than the rest of the site, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be very focused on Migrate DB Pro, and the Delicious Brains branding and stuff kind of takes a backseat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Anyway, you&amp;#8217;ll see what I mean once it&amp;#8217;s launched, but hopefully &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s cool.  Looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, the biggest thing with it is like I&amp;#8217;ve been doing A/B testing and all these little incremental changes.  Then this change is just this massive thing, right?  It&amp;#8217;s like, okay, I hope conversions go up.  Right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, definitely.  Rebranding my personal site is something that I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to do for the last year.  I mean, PippinsPlugins.com hasn&amp;#8217;t changed in two or three years.  It&amp;#8217;s on the second design the site has had, but that&amp;#8217;s it, over the lifespan of four or five years.  And so, it&amp;#8217;s been due for a revamp for a long time, but it&amp;#8217;s one of those that I really want to do it myself, but trying to figure out how to give myself the time to actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s very easy to say I&amp;#8217;ll do it next week.  I&amp;#8217;ll do it next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s very easy to say yeah, and do it is another thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, especially when there&amp;#8217;s not necessarily major problems with it right now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Yeah, I mean that&amp;#8217;s the thing.  There must be things that bug you about it though, like oh, I wish this was like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, there are tons of things that bug me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	 But sometimes they&amp;#8217;re not necessarily enough to push me over the ledge to decide to spend 20 or 30 hours doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  It may be just chipping away at it is the better….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to do.  It&amp;#8217;s just a matter of getting that started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  That&amp;#8217;s kind of what I started out planning to do.  I was just going to redesign the features page and the pricing page.  Then now I&amp;#8217;m doing the checkout and my account and, you know, it&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Just a snowball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was originally going to start it by just redoing the page for my Restrict Content Pro plugin.  The way that that plugin is built, it&amp;#8217;s kind of similar to your scenario where you have Delicious Brains, and then you have a page on there for WP Migrate DB Pro.  Okay.  Where do you host the add-ons?  Where do you host the documentation, all of those things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I have that exact same problem with Restrict Content Pro, and so I&amp;#8217;ve been debating between rebuilding the site in such a way that it&amp;#8217;s easy for me to section those pages out, or to just build a completely new site for Restricted Content Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  How do you feel about that, like the separate site for each product versus like a single site?  Yeah, an umbrella site, let&amp;#8217;s say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So part of me loves it.  I mean it&amp;#8217;s so much easier to set up documentation, to set up support articles, things like that, when there is an entire site dedicated to one product.  For example, if I was to add a documentation link to the navigation in PippinsPlugins.com, well, what does that refer to?  What plugin?  There&amp;#8217;s over 100 plugins on PippinsPlugins.com.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	How is somebody going to know that that&amp;#8217;s Restrict Content Pro documentation?  When you have a dedicated site for a product, you get rid of those problems.  But you might lose some of the strong branding that comes with that, the other site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	PippinsPlugins.com has much stronger branding and recognition than, say, RestrictContentPro.com does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so I have not figured out what to do with it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.  Yeah, I mean, that&amp;#8217;s kind of what I was thinking is that if you have a brand that&amp;#8217;s an umbrella brand that, you know, above all these products, then that can be &amp;#8212; you can kind of strengthen that brand, and your customers who are, maybe there&amp;#8217;s customers just for one product, and they go to your site to view documentation or whatever.  And they see that you have another product, right?  You know, they can cross over between products very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Versus if it&amp;#8217;s separate sites that are on these islands, it&amp;#8217;s sometimes hard to kind of bring those together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.  I had somebody tell me the other day they were purchasing Affiliate WP.  They were also an Easy Digital Downloads customer, and I think they were a customer of PippinsPlugins.com too.  And they said, well, why don&amp;#8217;t you just have them all under one site?  I mean, you are the main person behind these products.  Why are they on separate sites?  I would love to have my one central account history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it was a good point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that was something that I had not really considered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Again, it&amp;#8217;s an interesting battle to try and figure out.  Do you separate your products out?  Do you put them on their own sites?  Do you put them all in one site?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What about putting them all in the same site, but you could design each page to be very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s exactly what I&amp;#8217;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s kind of what I&amp;#8217;ve been contemplating doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean that&amp;#8217;s what Apple does, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Each section of their site is very, very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s still Apple.com, but it&amp;#8217;s apple.com/ipod, apple.com/macbook, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And each one looks very different.  And I like that idea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Speaking of products, I did something yesterday.  This is, I think, maybe the second time that I&amp;#8217;ve really done this.  I discontinued a commercial plugin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You bastard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	How dare I.  It was kind of bittersweet.  It was one of the first maybe three or four commercial plugins I wrote, so the plugin was about three or four years old at this point.  It was sold on CodeCanyon, and it was called Sugar Modal Windows, and so it was a plugin for creating popup modal windows that you could insert into a post or page.  And so you&amp;#8217;d just have a button, you&amp;#8217;d click it, and it would open the modal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin did pretty well.  I mean it was never a get rich plugin by any means, but it did pretty well for itself considering how much time I spent building it and things like that.  But over the last six months or so, it&amp;#8217;s been kind of a headache to support.  For one, because it has just enough support that I do have to focus on it.  There are some plugins that get a support ticket every two months, and so if you get a ticket, it&amp;#8217;s not a big deal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one had a support ticket raised at least two or three times a week, and so it had a decent amount of support, but it was a bit of a headache to support.  Because it was an older plugin, it did some things in ways that were not necessarily that reliable, ways that, as a developer, I personally didn&amp;#8217;t like them.  So I kind of battled with myself every day when I was supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so, today, or yesterday, I decided to officially close the plugin.  And I had some comments come in from Twitter that I want to bring up and I think are a good topic for discussion.  There were a couple questions.  One, did you consider selling it to someone else to let them continue it?  Consider giving it to someone else?  Then someone asked &amp;#8212; I mentioned that for me it was not about the dollars that the plugin brought in.  It was the headache that the support caused.  Would I consider just giving it away on .org, or would I consider giving it to someone else to give away on .org?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these are all really interesting questions to consider when you discontinue a commercial product.  I have various answers to them but, Brad, what do you think?  When you discontinue a plugin, and this is a plugin that people have paid for and that people are definitely still actively using, what do you think are some of the things to keep in mind that you should probably do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s tough because you have so many other things going on, and this is really just a distraction at this point.  It was great in the beginning.  It was giving you a little bit of income, and you got your feet wet in the commercial plugin market, so it was definitely good in the early days, but now it&amp;#8217;s kind of a burden for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I mean, and it&amp;#8217;s not easy to sell something like this.  I mean that becomes an even bigger burden all of a sudden, right, when you&amp;#8217;re trying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  Is it worth it to go through the trouble of selling it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  It&amp;#8217;s GPL though, right, this thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, so I guess releasing it or getting someone to adopt it would probably be the best course of action if you can find someone fairly easily and, with your audience, that probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t be that hard to do.  The tricky part there though is that it&amp;#8217;s a paid commercial plugin, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Then that person now is on the hook kind of to support those &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Support all past customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; past customers, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	They would almost have to, like &amp;#8212; I think if they rebranded it, if they rebranded it as their own thing and then let those customers know this guy is rebranding this thing.  He&amp;#8217;s basically forking it and starting it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You can jump onboard with him and, you know, go from here with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Or you can just keep using what you&amp;#8217;re using now, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that&amp;#8217;s exactly what I&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8212; if it does get handed over to anybody else, that&amp;#8217;s probably what will happen.  At this point, I&amp;#8217;m not really interested in actively reaching out to find somebody to do that.  But if someone was to approach me and say hey, I would be interested, then absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, so if anybody &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t even really have that much interest in selling it.  I will happily give it away to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If they want to then sell it on their own, or they want to redistribute it, and however they choose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The issue for me was simply &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I mean they could have done that before, technically, because it&amp;#8217;s GPL, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	They could have forked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s nothing stopping someone from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But in this case, let&amp;#8217;s put it this way, as opposed to just forking and doing it, here, I will happily give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, because it did become &amp;#8212; it became a support headache not necessarily because of the problems the plugin encountered or the support issues that were raised, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	With a lot of things going on, I need to try and narrow my focus and to decide to put my time where it&amp;#8217;s more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean you probably developed this thing because you had a need for it at the time too, right, I&amp;#8217;m guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, at the time I built it because I thought it sounded like a cool idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which something that I&amp;#8217;ve learned over the last three years in building plugins, personally, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen some very well known people in the community say the exact opposite of this and adamantly disagree with me.  But I really don&amp;#8217;t, at least for me personally, I do not believe in building products that do not scratch my own itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I completely agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.  I don&amp;#8217;t like building products that I don&amp;#8217;t personally use because I am much less empathetic of problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.  I completely agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s much easier if you have a product &amp;#8212; and this plugin was a perfect example of this.  If somebody, if a user comes to me and says I have a problem, I&amp;#8217;m trying to do this, and I don&amp;#8217;t personally use the product, and I don&amp;#8217;t personally experience those problems day-to-day, it&amp;#8217;s much easier to say I&amp;#8217;m sorry; it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean you just have less invested in it, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You don&amp;#8217;t care as much, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But if someone comes to you, and you&amp;#8217;re using &amp;#8212; you&amp;#8217;re using EDD to power your primary business right now, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And it&amp;#8217;s your product.  And so if someone comes to you with something, you&amp;#8217;re like yeah, I&amp;#8217;m going to look into that.  You&amp;#8217;re damn right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  For example, over the last three days, we had a bug in EDD 2.0 that, in some bizarre cases, one that I could never reliably replicate, there would be a random error on the checkout screen that would say that payment gateway is not active.  And it would only apply when a discount code was used.  If I were not using EDD, I would say yes, we&amp;#8217;re going to get this resolved because that&amp;#8217;s kind of a serious problem because it prevented a purchase from going through.  But it would not be as important to me if I were not also experiencing that same problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Over the last three days, I had multiple customers come and say hey, I&amp;#8217;m trying to purchase an add-on from you with this discount code, but it won&amp;#8217;t let me.  So suddenly it&amp;#8217;s become a personal problem that affects my business as opposed to affecting one of my users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so it&amp;#8217;s much, much closer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s definitely &amp;#8212; I think it&amp;#8217;s definitely better to scratch your own itch when you can.  But, you know, I&amp;#8217;m not going to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you always have to.  I mean there are definitely cases where I could see myself getting really invested in a product idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And really wanting to, you know, hammer it out and make it awesome, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I could see that, but yeah, it&amp;#8217;s definitely easier when you scratch your own itch because &amp;#8212; and I found myself, like I&amp;#8217;ve had plugins where I scratch my own itch and, you know, I kept developing them for a while.  Then I stopped using that plugin, right?  A good example: Live Comment Preview.  That was a plugin I had for a while because I had these live comments.  The way it worked is, as you would type your comment in, it would show up on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve seen that plugin used before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Quite a few people still use it, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t using it anymore, right?  And people were reporting bugs, and I was like, I don&amp;#8217;t care that much anymore.  It&amp;#8217;s just this little plugin that I don&amp;#8217;t use anymore, and I&amp;#8217;m still supporting it.  It just didn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It just doesn&amp;#8217;t line up for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, and it might &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And so I gave it up for adoption, and someone else is maintaining it now that actually uses it and has a stake in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s still under your name.  Did you know that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s still listed under your name.  Did you know that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think my name is still on it, but there&amp;#8217;s someone else on it too, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nope, just you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah, crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m looking at it right now.  Oh, crap, now I&amp;#8217;ve got to do something on a plugin I don&amp;#8217;t care about anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Sometimes that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It does.  I mean, I have several plugins in the repository that are that way.  For example, I have a small event calendar plugin.  I really like the plugin, actually, and I really enjoyed writing it, but I don&amp;#8217;t actually use it on any of my sites, and so it&amp;#8217;s much more difficult for me to say, when somebody reports a bug, especially in the free version, to drop things that I&amp;#8217;m working on that I have a vested interest in to go fix it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You know what it is?  I gave them access to the GitHub repo, but they haven&amp;#8217;t updated the .org site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oops.  Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think that&amp;#8217;s what happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	We&amp;#8217;ll have to get that sorted out, but anyways if anyone else wants to work on Live Comment Preview, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The same thing with Sugar Modal Windows.  Anybody who wants it, it&amp;#8217;s pretty much open for adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There you go.  Adopting plugins is great.  You know, it&amp;#8217;s such a great way &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It is.  I gave up another plugin for adoption recently and had it successfully taken over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.  Which one is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I love the idea of continuing a plugin and letting someone take it because it is sad to see a plugin completely die, regardless of what the plugin does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Especially if it has a lot of active users and a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So we actually just adopted a plugin as well.  It&amp;#8217;s for excerpts.  It&amp;#8217;s called Advanced Excerpt plugin.  And it&amp;#8217;s kind of a boring plugin, to be honest.  All it does is give you more control over excerpts in your templates and themes.  For example, if you&amp;#8217;re using a theme off the .org repo or something, and you don&amp;#8217;t want to have to modify it to change the way the excerpts show up, you would use a plugin, this plugin, to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It gives you complete control.  You can choose how many words you want to show in your excerpt and all that kind of stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Anyway, this thing was well over the two-year period that, you know, it hadn&amp;#8217;t been developed for two years, so it had that yellow bar at the top on the .org page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And so we decided, you know, let&amp;#8217;s just take this over.  We&amp;#8217;ll make it.  We&amp;#8217;ll just roll it into the cost of the business, and we&amp;#8217;ll handle this because, I mean, this thing gets &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s heavily used, still.  Last week it had 7,000 downloads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right?  I figure, you know, this is a good way for us to contribute to the WordPress, just kind of give back.  And for us, I think, like, we put a little &amp;#8212; on the admin page, we put a little shout out to WP Migrate DB Pro, right, to give us a little bit of credit there for maintaining this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But that&amp;#8217;s about it, so I don&amp;#8217;t know.  Now that I think about it, we should just adopt Live Comment Preview as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Readopt it, you mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, because, I mean, I was looking at it from the point of view it&amp;#8217;s my plugin personally, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But, yeah, we could totally adopt that and….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s one of the things that&amp;#8217;s cool when you start getting &amp;#8212; when you have a team built up of people that you&amp;#8217;re working with is that you can have a plugin like that that you may personally be maintaining or you may be the one that wrote it, but when you have that team of people working with you, it can become a team effort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so supporting it, either supporting it or fixing bugs is much less of a burden on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Absolutely, yeah.  And you just make it part of the business, right?  It&amp;#8217;s just part of the business.  It&amp;#8217;s just part of the day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s much easier than trying to maintain it in your spare time when you&amp;#8217;re working a full-time job and, you know, that&amp;#8217;s kind of the reality for a lot of people that have plugins on .org, right?  This is their spare time that they use to develop these things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You&amp;#8217;re starting to see that a lot more in the WordPress community, right?  People donating time to, you know, WordPress Core or to plugins, to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Just as an example, WP Engine right now is trying to hire two new developers to work on WordPress Core full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s their only job at WP Engine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think that&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; DreamHost does that as well.  I think Schroder &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I don&amp;#8217;t remember if he works full time on Core.  I mean he does a ton.  He works on Core a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I don&amp;#8217;t remember if that&amp;#8217;s his full-time position at DreamHost or if it&amp;#8217;s part time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Still though, that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But still, it does; it benefits those.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It benefits those companies, whether it&amp;#8217;s DreamHost or WP Engine or somebody else because their business is built around WordPress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so if you can pay someone to help contribute back to WordPress Core, and maybe address some of the issues that you encounter, fantastic.  And, I mean, good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I think it just lines up, right?  Those interests all line up, so it makes complete sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s something that I&amp;#8217;m really interested in pursuing more in this next year, both with myself and anybody who is working with me, is giving back to Core more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m trying to actually get into the habit of setting aside like one day of the week that is for WordPress Core.  I haven&amp;#8217;t done it yet, but that&amp;#8217;s kind of my goal where that day or maybe that afternoon is doing nothing but working on WordPress Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	WordPress Core is hugely responsible for where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	WordPress Core, I mean, every single one of my products runs on top of WordPress, and so not only do I feel a little bit of obligation to give back and donate to something that empowered me so much, but also it&amp;#8217;s a good idea from a business perspective because all of my products run on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.  Yes, absolutely.  Here&amp;#8217;s a question though about Core.  I mean, if you get onto a Trac ticket that&amp;#8217;s, you know, getting pretty popular, I will say, you get the impression almost that there&amp;#8217;s too many cooks in the kitchen.  There are so many people working on one ticket or commenting on a ticket.  How much more, like, do they need your help is what, I guess, what I&amp;#8217;m getting at?  Is there already enough people working on WordPress Core?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, here&amp;#8217;s the thing.  I think there are definitely tickets where you can say there is not help needed because there are too many cooks in the kitchen.  But let&amp;#8217;s see if I can pull up a quick number real quick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Is there just so much work that there are definitely not enough people to&amp;#8211;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There are definitely not enough.  Real quick, I&amp;#8217;m just going to pull up the report that says here&amp;#8217;s the number of tickets that do not have a patch.  Now these are not necessarily tickets where they&amp;#8217;re going to get a patch in, or that this enhancement or this bug is going to get taken care of.  But the number of tickets currently in the system that say they need to have a patch &amp;#8212; and if WordPress Core will load.  It&amp;#8217;s going a little bit slow on me.  Currently there are 287 tickets that need a patch, and so is there a need to have more people involved to help write patches, to test patches?  Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It sounds like it, yeah, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean there are tickets that, in this list, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there are tickets in here that are more than two or three years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Maybe because they&amp;#8217;re a low priority, but also just because there hasn&amp;#8217;t been anybody to address them yet.  And so, yeah, there&amp;#8217;s absolutely work for people to do.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean that there needs to be more people on some of the more active tickets.  I mean, I think it&amp;#8217;s always nice to have people provide feedback and say yes, I like this approach, or have we considered this, because that&amp;#8217;s always helpful.  Well, mostly, mostly always.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Assuming you&amp;#8217;re doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  As we grow our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  As we grow our team, I&amp;#8217;m definitely going to be looking at that.  Maybe we&amp;#8217;ll do a Core contributor day once a week where, you know, our team just spends a whole day, all of us, working on Core tickets or something like that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That would be really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;d be a good idea, right, something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s definitely something that I&amp;#8217;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Even if you start small, like say, okay, I&amp;#8217;m going to work on it an hour every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then I&amp;#8217;m going to work on it two hours every Wednesday, and then slowly progress up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I think it would be….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think the big thing for a lot of people, or at least for me, the thing is with Core it&amp;#8217;s like it&amp;#8217;s almost intimidating because, like you said, there are 200-and-some tickets.  Where do I start?  It&amp;#8217;s just like this giant mountain that you&amp;#8217;re kind of chipping away at.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But I guess that&amp;#8217;s the point is that you just have to dive in there and find something to work on and work on it, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think, as I&amp;#8217;ve started to do it more frequently to jump in on tickets and such, I found it helps a lot to look at one component.  A component would be like a category.  For me, I am subscribed.  You can subscribe to email notifications with tickets on Trac for Core.  But you can also subscribe to tickets in a specific component.  So I get an email notification any time somebody opens a ticket related to plugins because that&amp;#8217;s kind of my focus.  That&amp;#8217;s what I like to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that helps me narrow my focus on Trac tickets, as opposed to just looking through this massive list of tickets and trying to find something.  Instead, look at a component.  If you like media, look at the media.  If you like the Cron API, you like plugins, et cetera.  Then you can even narrow that down even further and say I want to work on documentation for plugins.  You can take the plugins component with a focus of docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Or maybe there&amp;#8217;s something in the plugins API that doesn&amp;#8217;t perform very well, so you can look at plugins and then filter it by performance.  And so you could really narrow your focus much more.  This is also something that&amp;#8217;s come out the last, like, three months as Nacin has been building some of these filtering tools.  And that&amp;#8217;s helped a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not interested in writing in a patch, or you don&amp;#8217;t know how to, there&amp;#8217;s another one.  Nacin put in a getting started section where you can quickly just view: I want to look at patches that need testing.  These are patches that people have written.  All you have to do is apply it and say yes or no; it works for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, that&amp;#8217;s awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s made it so much easier to jump into these tickets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s also a tag that Core is using now called Good First Bug, which is basically they are tickets designed that are easier to patch for people, like, for their first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So if somebody is looking for their first ticket to jump into, go look at ones titled with Good First Bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that sounds awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I&amp;#8217;ve heard the Core developers say that they generally try to not patch those tickets themselves because they&amp;#8217;re trying to leave them for people that want to contribute for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Right.  That&amp;#8217;s cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I guess we should probably wrap it up.  We&amp;#8217;re at 50 minutes here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I think we&amp;#8217;ve been rambling for a while.  It&amp;#8217;s easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Just want to say that you should go to iTunes.  If you&amp;#8217;re listening to us on iTunes, give us a five star review and leave a little comment, if you want.  You don&amp;#8217;t have to.  You can just give us a five star review.  That&amp;#8217;s cool too.  But, yeah, we really appreciate any iTunes reviews because that kind of boosts our profile on iTunes and let&amp;#8217;s more people know about our podcast, so really appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.  And if you are willing, if you are interested with the rating as well, give us a review.  Let us know.  That means a lot to us and, in exchange, I&amp;#8217;ll happily take a look at your plugin, leave a rating for it, give it a quick review or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There you go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Thanks, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Catch you next time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

INTRO:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

PIPPIN:	Hello!  I am Pippin Williamson, and joining me as usual is Brad Touesnard.  Say hello, Brad.

BRAD:	Hey, everybody.

PIPPIN:	Welcome to Episode 19 of Apply Filters.  Today were going to talk about a lot of different things that weve been involved with recently, both projects, events, things going on in the community, et cetera, and it shouldnt fill up our whole episode.

But right before we get into that, we want to mention our sponsorship again, which comes from WP Ninjas and their recent product Ninja Demo.  Theyre getting ready to push out a new version that has some cool, new features on it.  If youre not familiar with Ninja Demo, go to ninjademo.com and check it out.  It is one of the only options available to easily create a demo environment for your WordPress themes or your plugins where potential customers can sign up in just seconds to get a dedicated demo where they can really give your product a test drive.

BRAD:	Yeah, thats cool.  Thats one thing I didnt really realize when they first launched is that each time a user starts a demo, its private.  You know, not everyone else could see what theyre doing and stuff.  

PIPPIN:	Yeah.

BRAD:	Thats super cool. 

PIPPIN:	One thing that I think is really cool about it is because its private -- the way that it works is you have a multisite install and then, when you generate a demo, it creates a new site within that multisite.  Then that user gets access to that site, which means that, depending on how you have it set up, you could give them access to edit any content they want.  So if youre demoing, say, an e-commerce plugin, you could allow them to create products, test sales, et cetera, and it wouldnt affect anyone elses demo.  

BRAD:	Cool.

PIPPIN:	Yeah, so its a pretty slick system.  Were using it on Affiliate WP right now, and its working really well.

BRAD:	Nice.  So, man, where have you been?  Youve been kicking around somewhere on a coast, I think.

PIPPIN:	Yeah, Ive been traveling a lot over the last week, mostly because I traveled to Oregon all of last week for BeachPress 2.0, which was this really cool event put on by Justin Sainton.  Basically the idea was to get 20 to 30 people from the WordPress community and put them in a house on the beach for a week and see what happens.

BRAD:	That sounds terrible.  What a terrible idea.

PIPPIN:	No, it was amazing.  It was really cool.  It was very much a -- it was kind of like an un-conference.  The idea was to have everybody come together, stay together in this house, and see how it works out.  So it was really a co-working situation where everybody was kind of doing their own thing.

	Since we were there for a full, I think, five days, there wasnt any of the normal tension that you might have from trying to get the scheduled events happening and make sure that everything happens on time to the schedule and that everybody gets their moneys worth.

BRAD:	Right.  There is a schedule to BeachPres</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;INTRO:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Now here&amp;#8217;s your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes, I am Brad Touesnard, and this Episode 18.  This time we have a special guest, Frankie Jarrett, and Japh Thomson is also joining us.  Say hello, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Hey, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Glad to have you guys onboard.  Real quick before we get started, we just want to give a quick shout out to our sponsors, which is WP Ninjas, and their latest project, Ninja Demo, which is a fantastic new platform they&amp;#8217;ve created for easily setting up live demos of your plugins and themes.  If you want to create a demo that customers can log into and then view the plugin or the theme in a live sandbox that&amp;#8217;s unique to that instance, that&amp;#8217;s what Ninja Demo allows you to do.  You can check it out at NinjaDemo.com.  I&amp;#8217;ve used it a couple times already and it&amp;#8217;s really pretty slick, so go check it out and see what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Awesome.  Frankie, do you want to start off by just maybe introducing yourself and let us know who you are, what you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Sure!  Absolutely!  It&amp;#8217;s good to be here with you guys.  If I can just say, that Ninja Demo thing looks really cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	I was playing around with it, and I thought, wow, this fills a huge need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.  Yeah, so a little bit about myself.  My name is Frankie Jarrett, and I&amp;#8217;m a WordPress developer.  I work for X-Team, and I&amp;#8217;m based in the Kansas City, Missouri area.  I&amp;#8217;ve been working with WordPress since about somewhere around 2.7, 2.8 release cycle, so it&amp;#8217;s been about six years or so.  When 3.0 came out is when I really decided, okay, WordPress is going to be my platform of choice, and I&amp;#8217;ve been working in WordPress ever since.  I&amp;#8217;ve been a core contributor in the past, and now I work full time on a plugin called Stream, which is X-Team&amp;#8217;s first venture into the plugin space.  That&amp;#8217;s been a lot of fun.  It&amp;#8217;s been a blast working on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	My favorite thing, probably, about working on X-Team is just getting to work with my colleagues remotely.  It&amp;#8217;s a blast just being able to work from home, being able to work with just such amazingly passionate people who are just excited to be doing, you know, the things that we do, developing on WordPress, and sharing that passion with … is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s a great &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s one of the great benefits of having a team of people that you work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Whether it&amp;#8217;s 5 or 20.  How many people are there on X-Team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	On X-Team, X-Team as a whole, there&amp;#8217;s lots of different teams, I suppose, within X-Team, and so X-Team, as a whole, I would say, is around just over 100 people, but the WordPress X-Team &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Holly cow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.  The WordPress portion of X-Team is about 17 or so developers.  Then our Stream team is even smaller than that since we&amp;#8217;re kind of a bootstrapping startup within that team.  So there&amp;#8217;s like about four of us, three of us full time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I never realized that X-Team was so big.  I guess I&amp;#8217;ve always known of X-Team from the WordPress side, and so I&amp;#8217;m familiar with like the WordPress team of X-Team.  For some reason I always assumed that that was all of X-Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	I know.  That&amp;#8217;s what a lot of people think.  We actually even have a Drupal team within X-Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	We have front-end developers.  We have a game development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Do you guys get together, like, during the year?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Man, I wish we did.  I wish we did.  We get together with our &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You could have like a Drupal/WordPress battle, like water fight or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Like a match-up, yeah.  Have, yeah, a water fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, we get together with our WordPress team, but we don&amp;#8217;t get together, unfortunately, with the whole team, and maybe we can change that some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s fantastic.  And I know you guys were all down in Miami, or a lot of you were two weeks ago.  Real quick before we go any further, Japh, let&amp;#8217;s have you jump in and tell us about yourself real quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Japh, are you around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, he might be &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, did we lose &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Sorry.  I&amp;#8217;m back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, no worries.  Fantastic.  Yeah, tell us about &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	I muted myself and forgot to un-mute myself.  Excellent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	I&amp;#8217;m Japh.  You may know me from my WordPress evangelist days at Envato.  I relatively recently, the last two months or so, joined X-Team to work on their Stream product that Frankie was talking about because basically it&amp;#8217;s something I found really interesting, really passionate about it, and wanted to get in there and help build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.  And how long have you been working with WordPress now?  I know that you worked for Envato as a WordPress evangelist for at least several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s for about four years or so, I think.  And I&amp;#8217;ve been working with WordPress since around about 2006, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I think we all got in around the same time, somewhere in the 2.7 release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Sounds like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think I got in &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Not me, man.  I go way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah?  How long have you been working with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t know what release cycle that is.  What, 2.4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t know either, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	You&amp;#8217;re vintage, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	That&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8212; WordPress was like, what, one year old at that point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was in high school then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I was working at a coop work term.  My coworker started a blog on this thing called WordPress, and so I was like, maybe I should have a blog.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s pretty much how it started.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool, so you guys work &amp;#8212; you&amp;#8217;re both part of X-Team, and you both work on the WordPress team, obviously.  And you&amp;#8217;re both working on the Stream plugin.  Within your work with X-Team, are you doing any other WordPress work, or is it only Stream right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so we, the X-Team WordPress team, we mainly do enterprise level work, so working at a partner type level with other large companies that have maybe multiple websites or multisite networks or, you know, big sites running on WordPress.  We&amp;#8217;ll come in and, you know, develop custom plugins and custom functionalities, custom themes.  Then we do the ongoing support and maintenance type contracts to keep those sites running, working with their producer teams to make sure that things are being tested and implemented, and QA&amp;#8217;d properly with their QA teams, and then overseeing deployments of that stuff to production.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s kind of full service type stuff.  We&amp;#8217;ve been doing that for several years.  We&amp;#8217;re a VIP partner, and that&amp;#8217;s been a good part of the business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  Did you guys&amp;#8211;?  I don&amp;#8217;t think we talked about what is Stream.  Have we?  We haven&amp;#8217;t really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Not really.  I think we only maybe hinted on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Let&amp;#8217;s dig into that.  Do you want to do that, Japh?  Maybe you can start off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Sure.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Essentially, Stream is a free plugin that you can download from the WordPress.org plugin directory that lets you track and monitor everything that happens in your WordPress site, basically.  It&amp;#8217;ll show you an activity feed of what&amp;#8217;s been happening, whether it was new posts created, published, installing, activating the activating plugins, changing settings, everything that happens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	So you can kind of keep track of all that stuff.  It&amp;#8217;s great for troubleshooting if you have it installed on a client&amp;#8217;s website and your client says something has happened on my website, and I have no idea how that happened.  You can log in and go, oh, well, that&amp;#8217;s because you did this.  So next time just be careful of that and make sure you do that first or whatever, and that kind of stuff.  You can also, for security, you know, if someone has added a link into your post, you can sort of see how that came in, happened and, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s got a pretty wide range of uses, but that&amp;#8217;s essentially what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I see that it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; so one of the things that you guys mentioned in the summary of what the plugin does is that it tracks logged in user activity.  Does it also track changes?  Okay, so let&amp;#8217;s say that you modify a page, and you insert a post, you insert a link in that page.  If that&amp;#8217;s done by a logged in user, that&amp;#8217;s going to be tracked, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.  Now let&amp;#8217;s say that a plugin modifies that same page, but from the plugin side of things, so it&amp;#8217;s not via a logged in user.  Does it still get tracked, or is it only tied to users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	It&amp;#8217;s not only tied to users.  And assuming that fires, you know, the correct hooks in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm, yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Which, you know, if the plugin is built properly, it should.  Then it will still track it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What if someone has like a form, like they&amp;#8217;re using one of the form plugins on the front-end and a form submission occurs?  Is that tracked?  Do you see that in Stream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Again, assuming that it fires all the right hooks, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You guys have it &amp;#8212; am I right?  You guys have it set up so that there is an API or an API coming that allows you to create custom events, so if a plugin wanted to tie in to track custom actions, regardless of the hook they&amp;#8217;re using, they can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	You can do that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t remember.  Is that something that&amp;#8217;s in the plugin right now, or is that coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	It&amp;#8217;s in there right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	It&amp;#8217;s in the plugin right now, and I think the logged in user kind of, I guess, blurb that describes that plugin, I think, is for, you know, the overwhelming majority of use cases, it tracks logged in activity.  But, yeah, Japh is totally right.  If it fires the hooks, then that&amp;#8217;s what Stream is listening for.  So if those hooks are fired within the WordPress API, even if they&amp;#8217;re fired by using WP-CLI, Stream will track it.  So it&amp;#8217;ll even know, hey, things are being modified on the command or to WordPress using the command line, and it&amp;#8217;ll track that as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So you guys are listening on, like, certain hooks and recording, you know, activity on those hooks.  Is that how it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.  Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What are some examples of the hooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Essentially, and sometimes we&amp;#8217;re having to hack around even.  If there&amp;#8217;s not a particular hook there, we kind of hook it; use other hooks to kind of detect when something has happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Gotcha.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Quick question for you because I actually ran into this the other day.  Have you ever found yourself needing to track some data when something gets inserted into the database, and there is no hook that fires during that database write.  And so you actually hook into the filters and actions that are in the WP DB class.  Have you ever done that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ve ever done that in particular.  Well, wait.  I might take that back.  We may be doing something like that actually for widgets because widgets lack some proper hooks when things are changed.  And so we&amp;#8217;re having to grab.  I think, though, we&amp;#8217;re grabbing into the globals, and we&amp;#8217;re monitoring changes that occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I just remember, not too long ago.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember what plugin I was working on, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out a way to track it.  I think I was doing an integration between a membership plugin and my affiliate plugin.  I was trying to find a way to identify their queries.  And the only way that I could find it was literally looking at the SQL query before it&amp;#8217;s executed and say, like, well, if it&amp;#8217;s for this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE: 	Whoa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And … kind of query stuff, I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	That&amp;#8217;s pretty low level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It felt pretty dirty, but there&amp;#8217;s actually hooks in the DB class that allow you to do that if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It feels dirty at first, Pippin, but you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s a certain level of awesome to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  What are some examples of hooks that you guys are using?  What kind of activity are we talking about?  What are some examples?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so I think some examples, the most common ones would be &amp;#8212; so WordPress is made up of all these different APIs, right?  There&amp;#8217;s widgets API.  There&amp;#8217;s settings API.  There&amp;#8217;s post types.  There&amp;#8217;s taxonomies.  The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Every one of these areas within WordPress, we have set up each one of these areas as &amp;#8220;connectors&amp;#8221;.  If you look at the source code of the plugin, you&amp;#8217;ll see that there&amp;#8217;s an abstract class called connector.  Then we&amp;#8217;ve got these child classes that are for each individual area within WordPress.  We have unique callbacks fired within those, so for post types we&amp;#8217;re looking for things like, you know, when the post is updated, post created, post deleted, post transition, so keeping track of when posts transition through statuses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for things like the settings API, you know, when are settings created?  When are they updated?  When are they deleted?  And keeping track of those changes, so when they get piped into Stream, Stream then filters that data that&amp;#8217;s happening and organizes it in such a way so when you&amp;#8217;re viewing your Stream inside of your WordPress admin, you see all that activity in an organized fashion.  So you could say: show me all settings that have updated.  Show me all settings in the general tab that have been updated.  And you can kind of narrow down your search to see what&amp;#8217;s happening on the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s really cool.  You guys have extensions for this free plugin that you&amp;#8217;re selling too, right?  What are those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s right.  We have four extensions available at the moment.  There&amp;#8217;s one called Cherry Pick, which allows you to remove items from your activity feed.  There&amp;#8217;s a data importer/exporter, so you can get all the activity back out of your database if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Can you export it from one Stream install into another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	No, there&amp;#8217;s no import functionality.  It&amp;#8217;s export only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Sorry &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	We thought about that, and we were like, well, if you&amp;#8217;re migrating sites, you&amp;#8217;re going to do a database migration anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Probably.  And Stream isn&amp;#8217;t really content.  It&amp;#8217;s just activity, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.  And then we have &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	&amp;#8211; reporting, so you can kind of &amp;#8212; instead of just having the activity feed, you can kind of have a nice, more histogramic kind of look at your activity.  And the last one we have, and it&amp;#8217;s probably my personal favorite, is notifications, which is really nice.  You can kind of tailor very much what you do and don&amp;#8217;t get notified about.  So you&amp;#8217;re not just getting a fire hose of notifications, but they are either push notifications to your mobile device or email notifications for, you know, really specific activity that you want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the example I mentioned before, if you have your client using your website, and you know they don&amp;#8217;t update all that often, but you&amp;#8217;d like to kind of be able to help them out if they do something wrong when they are, you could make it so it just notifies you when anyone other than you modifies that site.  Then you get a push notification, and you can give them a call.  I think Frankie has experienced exactly that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, for sure, notifications.  I&amp;#8217;m the same as Japh.  It&amp;#8217;s probably my favorite one.  Reports has the eye candy factor, I guess.  It shows you some cool looking, responsive charting.  But with notifications, I really like that one because you can do some pretty granular things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Have you guys played with the iTunes Smart Playlist feature before?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I haven&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s where the idea was actually inspired from for building these notification triggers.  So you can do and/or logic and nesting of triggers inside of a notification rule.  And you can do some cool stuff, you know, like saying if the editor role and author roles log into the site on a Saturday and make a change, notify me.  So it&amp;#8217;s like you can use some pretty &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s so cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so you can do, like, are people working on the weekends?  Are people not working on the weekends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty neat.  You could even say, like, if they are updating just this particular post.  So it&amp;#8217;s not just any update.  It could be: are they just changing widgets, or are they just updating the main menu?  You know, if I don&amp;#8217;t want anyone messing with the main menu because the main menu is really important, then I can say, hey; notify me if anyone ever touches this and changes something about the main navigation.  That kind of stuff, I think, is pretty cool.  There are just like so many use cases that it could apply to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s pretty fantastic.  I think that&amp;#8217;s by far my favorite aspect of the entire plugin as well is that kind of control in getting those notifications of different things that you need.  One of my favorite ideas of how to extend the Stream plugin, which I know you and I, we&amp;#8217;ve talked about it a couple times in the past, but I love the idea of saying, like if you take an ecommerce system and create a custom login event using what I think you guys call your connectors and set up certain rules.  For example, if you have a sale over $500, or you have a sale that matches possible fraud flags.  Take those parameters and then send an alert to somebody.  I love the idea of hooking into Stream to add that kind of support.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, totally, that&amp;#8217;s a really cool idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hopefully at some point in the near future that&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m going to be working on.  It would be fun.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I have a question about Stream.  I&amp;#8217;m curious.  Okay.  Here&amp;#8217;s a quick scenario first.  Let&amp;#8217;s say you have a large membership website that is all based around user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Let&amp;#8217;s say your name is Pippin Williamson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, let&amp;#8217;s say your name is Jonathan Williamson.  You run the website my brother has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	For example, my brother runs a website that has 6,000 to 7,000 active subscribers log in constantly every day.  The entire site is membership.  Tons and tons of content, as well as tons of publicly submitted content, which is all then stored as posts.  Are there performance concerns when you have that much stuff happening with logged in users?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there&amp;#8217;s the natural decrease in performance you&amp;#8217;re going to have simply based on that much content being created, being delivered, etc.  But I guess what I&amp;#8217;m asking is, what have you guys done with Stream to help mitigate possible performance concerns simply because of how you&amp;#8217;re logging everything?  I mean, because if you&amp;#8217;re logging too much data, do you ever run into where you bog down the database?  I&amp;#8217;ve played with it, and I didn&amp;#8217;t see any issues with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What I&amp;#8217;m really curious is how did you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so this is a huge &amp;#8212; this is a really important topic and something that we are always looking to improve and want feedback from.  One of the best pieces of feedback we got was actually from Jason Cohen, the founder of WP Engine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	We were talking with him in Austin, at WordCamp Austin, and we were talking to him specifically about performance and things like that.  We were talking about how Stream, you know, it&amp;#8217;s monitoring database changes, right?  So when there&amp;#8217;s a database change that happens, that&amp;#8217;s when Stream makes a log to let you know that it happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the principle is that a database write is happening anyway.  And so what Stream is essentially doing is, after that writes, it&amp;#8217;s doing another lightweight write to its own table saying that it happened.  And it&amp;#8217;s more lightweight because it doesn&amp;#8217;t; the object isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as big as like a post object.  It&amp;#8217;s not nearly as resource intensive, and the table is a lot more flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are interested in how can we make things even more performance conscious, so Japh and I were having a conversation with Shady, another developer on the project, and we were coming to some new conclusions because we had architected Stream in such a way that every action that happens can have a context.  Well, we had originally architected it to where there could be multiple contexts.  Well, to do that, we had to have a relationship table in between Stream&amp;#8217;s main table and the metatable to be able to say, hey, there are multiple contexts available for this record row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after getting a lot of user feedback and a lot of testing ourselves, we came to the conclusion that having multiple contexts for a single action, there&amp;#8217;s never going to be a use case for that, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t appear that there &amp;#8212; we haven&amp;#8217;t come across one yet.  And no customer or no user has said that they need this, and so we decided we&amp;#8217;re going to remove that in an upcoming version.  It actually eliminates another database table, so now there are only two database tables and makes the writing even quicker.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those kinds of things are definitely a concern.  I think, when you do have maybe tens of thousands of users, it&amp;#8217;s something you need to monitor, just like you would need to monitor database performance anyway for, I think, a site that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Of course.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	But that would be my take on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I guess, like, how many people or how many of your users have you seen where they have a ton of traffic hitting their dashboard though?  That must be fairly rare.  Is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	We had one example relatively recently where we saw a real world kind of example from one of our users.  They were just getting pummeled by failed login attempts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	And so what Stream does probably even more than just tracking logged in users, what Stream does is track changes to your site.  We actually kind of worked out that something like 95%, I think it was, of the activity being tracked by this site was failed login attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	And we thought, well, that&amp;#8217;s not a change.  I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not ideal, but there&amp;#8217;s other things like Brute Protect or things like that that you should be using to mitigate that, right?  We actually made the executive decision to stop Stream from tracking that because it bloats the database.  It kind of makes it difficult to see what else is happening in your Stream.  And it&amp;#8217;s not a change to your site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Yeah, that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Ultimately, it might be nice to see those here and there.  But if you&amp;#8217;re seeing a ton of those, it&amp;#8217;s really not that useful.  You&amp;#8217;ve already been; you&amp;#8217;ve already realized now that you have an issue and that you should address it in some other means that you don&amp;#8217;t need to register that, or you don&amp;#8217;t need to track it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	It&amp;#8217;s like if Stream is &amp;#8212; if 95% of what Stream is tracking is failed login attempts, which is a front-end action by a user, there&amp;#8217;s no database write involved.  Then, effectively, what Stream becomes is a failed login attempt tracker and, oh, it happens to track some other cool stuff too.  And that&amp;#8217;s not the purpose of Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s now where you want the focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so we &amp;#8212; then the next version in 1.4.6, like Japh mentioned, we kind of had a pow-wow.  We decided, okay, the next version we&amp;#8217;re stripping this functionality.  If people want it, you know, we&amp;#8217;ll give them a Gist or something for developers, but it&amp;#8217;s going to not be something that&amp;#8217;s part of Stream anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Do you guys have&amp;#8211;?  I want to get into the topic, two different subjects in development now.  Number one, do you guys have any developer documentation, or plans to, to help people who want to create custom login events?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s say that I wanted to log some event in Easy Digital Downloads, for example.  As far as I know, there&amp;#8217;s a way to do that.  But will you guys be putting together any documentation or examples that show how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	We definitely will.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  That would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	There&amp;#8217;ll be documentation coming to kind of explain how to do that, sort of just developer docs.  Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	We will definitely be doing that.  We haven&amp;#8217;t done that yet.  We&amp;#8217;ve got our &amp;#8212; so we have our four main extensions and, in sort of the next few things that we&amp;#8217;ll be adding to the list of extensions are connectors for some other popular plugins.  And so once we have those out, that&amp;#8217;s actually helping us flush out some of that documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  And my other developer question for you is, as far as I know, this is public on GitHub.  Are you guys actively interested in encouraging an open community development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, we definitely are.  It&amp;#8217;s been great because I think our plugin has only been out for about seven months.  I think we initially launched in like the very beginning of December with like an alpha version to the public.  Since then, just by last count, I&amp;#8217;m just checking now, 22.  We have 22 contributors on the project.  A lot of those are X-Teamers that kind of caught the vision too and wanted to be a part, and contributed here and there.  But there are a handful of folks on there that just, they fell in love with Stream too, and they wanted to do something to contribute back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve got a lot of good issues created from the community too, and not just pull requests, but just issues just saying, hey, I found a bug or, hey, I&amp;#8217;ve got a feature enhancement idea for consideration.  It&amp;#8217;s been a big part.  I think that&amp;#8217;s what really makes us the most excited about the project, in general, is just getting other folks contributing to it because, at some point, the project becomes limited by your own … if you are so worried about, you know, doing every little thing in a closed little box.  If you open that up, I think you can reach further and do cooler stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.  Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	How much of your guys&amp;#8217; time goes into Stream right now?  Are you guys full time on this?  How many of you are full time on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, we are full time on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.  Yep, yep, Japh is full time.  Luke Carbis is another developer on our team who is full time.  I am full time, but then I am also, technically, I&amp;#8217;ve got other obligations with some of our VIP partners, so I jump out every now and then to talk to customers or help with other developers that are dealing with issues with some of our enterprise clients.  So I guess I&amp;#8217;m full time and then some on that stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Eighty hours a week, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But like Japh and Luke and myself, we&amp;#8217;re full time on Stream.  We have other developers on the team that are part-time like Shady.  He&amp;#8217;s one of our developers in Cairo.  And he is instrumental in creating the architecture of Stream from the early days and continues to be a force to be reckoned with because the guy is a machine.  I mean, he&amp;#8217;s one of my favorite guys to work with.  And so just having guys &amp;#8212; and Weston Ruter, who is a big contributor in WordPress 3.9.  He&amp;#8217;s been contributing.  He built the WP-CLI integration into Stream.  And so just having guys like even part time has been great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I just looked at &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m actually looking through the code of the plugin right now, and I just looked at your connectors class.  That&amp;#8217;s fantastic.  I love the way that it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s so simple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	At first &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	We try to be simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I like the way that you guys have basically set up a white list of actions, and then you just create a call back for each one on how you want that to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s really cool.  Is there&amp;#8211;?  I haven&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; I originally used the plugin, I think, like the first week that you guys released it, and I haven&amp;#8217;t used it since because I haven&amp;#8217;t had a use case.  Is there a UI for enabling and disabling connectors, or are all connectors generally considered to be enabled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, all connectors technically are enabled by default.  However, there is a settings screen in a tab called exclude where you can exclude certain connectors or contexts or even actions from ever being tracked by Stream.  So if you know for a fact that, you know, this is my website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that I&amp;#8217;m Pippin for a second.  I&amp;#8217;m Pippin.  I&amp;#8217;ve got a website.  I want to track everything everyone else is doing, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to track what I&amp;#8217;m doing.  Then you could put yourself in, your user as an exclusion, so nothing that you did would be tracked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mu-ha-ha.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m kind of excited to play with it again now.  I kind of want to throw it up on one of my sites and just &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m generally the only person that&amp;#8217;s on my sites, but I still want to play with it just because I think it&amp;#8217;s super cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so I might be &amp;#8212; we&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes.  I&amp;#8217;m kind of interested in going in and looking at creating a new connector, mostly for fun.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Mm-hmm, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We&amp;#8217;ll see how that goes.  That&amp;#8217;ll be cool.  Brad, any other questions for the guys about Stream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t think so, no.  I think we&amp;#8217;ve covered lots here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  Why don&amp;#8217;t we switch topics really quickly then?  Frankie, I know you have contributed to WordPress Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And, Japh, I think you have as well.  Is that true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yep, yep, certainly have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  Why don&amp;#8217;t you tell us real quickly what kind of contributions have you given back to WordPress Core and what&amp;#8217;s your interest in contributing to Core?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah, so my contributions have been pretty minimal, but they were up my alley, which is, I was at WordCamp San Francisco last year, so that&amp;#8217;d be 2013, and we had a contrib day.  I think it was the day before.  Maybe it was the day after.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember, but it was a lot of fun.  It was the first time I got to sit down with some of the Core devs and, you know, because Trac is a scary place.  It&amp;#8217;s frightening and laced with all kinds of landmines.  You get deathly afraid, no matter how seasoned of a developer you are.  You&amp;#8217;re looking around going what in the hell is all this.  This seems like a lot of red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once you get past that fear, that&amp;#8217;s what I needed.  And so I was able to sit down with some guys, watch them do some tickets and be like, oh, I can do this.  And was able to contribute to some of like the escaping functions, some cleanup that needed to be done in Core that was kind of waiting for cleanup.  So I went through, found some tickets, was able to clean up some escaping functions that were needing to be patched.  That was my first experience with Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any advice I could give to any developer, no matter what stage you&amp;#8217;re in, is to not be afraid of Trac and to try to attend a WordCamp that does have a contributor day.  It was hugely valuable for me, and I think it would be valuable to anyone who is interested in contributing to find a Core contrib day and go to it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I would absolutely agree with that.  Japh, how about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Definitely.  Yeah, definitely.  I think it must have been for 3.4, Mike Schroder and Marko Heijnen were working on Image Editor, and making it so you didn&amp;#8217;t have to just use GD for image stuff.  You could also use Imagick.  And so I helped with some of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that stuff in particular, a lot of the work that I was doing didn&amp;#8217;t make it in, mainly because it was for the command line version.  And the idea was to be able to do, so like if you were doing a batch resize or things like that, to be able to handle it on the command line in a single command instead of doing a call for each image and stuff like that.  And basically we couldn&amp;#8217;t guarantee that hosts would necessarily have access to all of that stuff and checking for it and all that kind of stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stuff, most of that stuff didn&amp;#8217;t make it in, the bulk of that work.  And every time I see Mike now, he&amp;#8217;s like, oh, man, it&amp;#8217;d be really good if we could go back and get that stuff in there.  But, you know, maybe it&amp;#8217;ll happen one day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in 3.6, I contributed on the plugins screen.  When you go to install a plugin, there&amp;#8217;s a favorites tab, so you could go add a new plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, that&amp;#8217;s right.  I remember that ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	The favorites tab, basically I built a plugin that added that.  There was no API call to WordPress.org at the time, and so I was essentially being … scraping, and I got an email from Otto saying my plugin had been removed because it was scraping, and that wasn&amp;#8217;t very nice.  And I said, well, how about an API.  And he said, funny you should say.  The reason I realized you were scraping is because I was building the API just for that.  So Otto and I worked together and got the favorites screen in there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it was the fastest large feature I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen built in the core.  It was just amazing timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Scraping will do that, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	…build a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Well, it was such amazing timing that I just built it.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Obviously we don&amp;#8217;t know how long Otto, I mean, unless you do &amp;#8212; we don&amp;#8217;t know how long Otto spent writing the API and updating that.  But, I mean, it was like Japh wrote the plugin, released it.  The next day it was gone.  And then there was a track ticket that says, hey, let&amp;#8217;s do this.  And later that night it was committed and done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was pretty cool to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	It was just amazing.  Just the timing thing, I think, you know, Otto had done that, done the backend stuff.  I had done the interface stuff.  Then we merged it together, together, and yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s kind of a cool example of how &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	That&amp;#8217;s my contribution to Core, anyway, and I&amp;#8217;m hoping to get some time to do some stuff, either in 4 or 4.1 for either the WP-API or maybe some internationalization stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The WP-API as in the JSON API?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That would be cool.  I played with it quite a bit, and I was actually trying to work on it actively in the early days of the API, and then I got busy, and I kind of dropped off from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	The same here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I love what they&amp;#8217;re doing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Did you guys see that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, well, it&amp;#8217;s slated for the 4.1 roadmap now, so that&amp;#8217;s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So did you guys see that email that went out about reworking the plugin screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	I did, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That was pretty &amp;#8212; I like that the discussion got started on that because I think it is an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	It&amp;#8217;s Alex Shields, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	I think Alex is working on that, right?  I was in the dev chat yesterday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes, I believe so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think there&amp;#8217;s several.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yes, and he&amp;#8217;s an Aussie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think there&amp;#8217;s several people working on it, actually, already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yes.  Yeah, there are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	(Indiscernible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I really can&amp;#8217;t wait to see how that turns out.  I mean, there are a so many different ways that it could go.  But I love the fact that it&amp;#8217;s getting discussed and changing because it really hasn&amp;#8217;t changed.  Well, put it this way.  I&amp;#8217;ve never seen anything different as long as I&amp;#8217;ve used WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	I was going to say, in the meeting yesterday they said, if you look at the 2.7 plugin screen and the plugin screen now, so like they&amp;#8217;re pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	So that basically means, from what we talked about at the beginning of this podcast, that&amp;#8217;s pretty much as long as most of us have been using WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It means it&amp;#8217;s perfect, that it doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be changed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s clearly perfect.  Don&amp;#8217;t change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Well, the thing that stuck out to me the most on that discussion, and I don&amp;#8217;t know if this will actually happen.  It&amp;#8217;s maybe more than just a rework of the design and maybe has to do with search API.  But talking about re-weighting the search so that, like, plugins that have, you know, graphics or plugins that have a good ratio of closed support tickets, high activity, good ratings and recent ratings get higher up on the search results because right now it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, fortunately, if you type in Stream into a plugin search, we&amp;#8217;re the first one.  But I know that, for a lot of other plugins, if you type in ecommerce, for instance, you know, I don&amp;#8217;t think Easy Digital Downloads is the number one result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m even remotely close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	But if there was something more than just like keywords because sometimes plugins that maybe aren&amp;#8217;t worthy to be the number one on the list because they haven&amp;#8217;t been updated in two years, show up number one on the list when there is another plugin five down below it that maybe should be a the top of the list because it&amp;#8217;s an active project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  A lot of….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I would love to see the weighting happen so that let&amp;#8217;s say that you have an old plugin that&amp;#8217;s been at the top of the list for a long time, and it&amp;#8217;s just kind of an old man in the game.  But then a new one comes along and immediately gets 100 awesome ratings.  Like that should show up really high.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Right.  Where&amp;#8217;s the WordPress Panda, you know … for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I would love to see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	They were talking about this yesterday where Alex Shields mentioned that, at the moment, you know, it&amp;#8217;s like a MySQL backend on the search stuff, and there&amp;#8217;s only so much they can sort of get out of that.  And he was thinking, at some point, probably not for this initial change, but some point soon he might tackle changing it across to a different, more search oriented platform, which I think would be pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	And that&amp;#8217;s actually even something that we&amp;#8217;re talking about doing with Stream.  You know, a little bit of a kind of a secret, bit of information, I suppose, that we&amp;#8217;re kind of working on a hosted platform for Stream so that you can host your activity loads in the cloud.  And one of the advantages for that is better search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Interesting.  Yeah, so there&amp;#8217;s quite a discussion already going on under Alex&amp;#8217;s post on Make, on the Make blog, make.wordpress.org.  Yeah, we&amp;#8217;ll link that up in the show notes.  And so if anybody is interested in taking part in that discussion, hop right in there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	We were all at WordCamp Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE: 	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Maybe we should just have a little &amp;#8212; what did you guys think of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	I had a great time.  It was like, wow, that campus was beautiful, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, my God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Amazing.  It was such an amazing venue, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	How would you get work done?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You didn&amp;#8217;t get any work done?  Isn&amp;#8217;t that like the sign of a great conference?  I didn&amp;#8217;t get any work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	No, I just mean, like, how would you if you went to that university?  You&amp;#8217;d be sitting there all the time just going, I&amp;#8217;m just going to have a coffee by the water here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Well, it&amp;#8217;s funny because I was talking to a local, and I said, yeah, we&amp;#8217;re at this conference at University of Miami.  And she goes, oh, yeah, University of Miami where you go to work on your tan.  So apparently it&amp;#8217;s like a local saying is the students there don&amp;#8217;t work very hard, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I could see that.  Just like the venue itself, like the building itself, like the way the conference rooms were set up, and then they had that nice hallway with the couches outside.  I thought it was just like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	It was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; perfect setup for….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve always liked the venue that they&amp;#8217;ve had in the previous years, which is on the same university, just a different building.  It was a completely different setup, but also really excellent.  I think university campuses generally work pretty well for WordCamps.  I&amp;#8217;d love to see them use more.  I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re really hard to get a hold of and reserve or not, but WordCamp Miami has always done an excellent job with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	WordCamp Sidney, I think, usually tends to happen in a university campus as well, and that is actually quite good.  I know that if I ran a WordCamp here in Hobart, or if someone did, the University of Tasmania is okay, but you would feel a little bit like maybe you ducked back to the &amp;#8217;70s for a minute if you were on the campus there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sweet!  You could sell that, man.  Time warp.  It&amp;#8217;s like going back in time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Time warp WordCamp, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	So, Brad and Pippin, I know you both spoke at Miami, but what was your favorite talk that wasn&amp;#8217;t your own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I usually don&amp;#8217;t like my own that well, so that wouldn&amp;#8217;t even be hard.  I watched &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;d say Brian Richards&amp;#8217; talk was my favorite, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.  Brian Richards was excellent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	He was so well spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Yes, a great talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it was just so polished.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t hate you.  I just hate your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah, that was it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I really enjoyed that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It sounds kind of like a silly or title or whatever, but it was a really good example of how you can have a great, great plugin or a great theme or any great platform.  I think WordPress is a really perfect example of it where you can have a great platform, but it has some really crappy code in it.  And a lot of that is because of legacy.  It&amp;#8217;s not necessarily because they were bad developers who wrote it or whatever reason.  But the point is that every project, whether it&amp;#8217;s WordPress or a plugin, has parts that are less than beautiful to it, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t make it a bad system.  And I like that, and I like Brian worked to highlight that, including mentioning a very well known plugin in his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Just slipped that in there nicely.  I actually also really enjoyed Mark Jaquith&amp;#8217;s I Can&amp;#8217;t JavaScript, and so Can You!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was really sad I didn&amp;#8217;t get to go to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, totally.  Pippin and I were on the podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because that was during our podcasting panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, the podcasting panel next door.  We could hear you guys in the other room, and we were like, oh, man, they&amp;#8217;re having such a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve seen Mark a couple of times.  He&amp;#8217;s always excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Well, don&amp;#8217;t feel too bad, but it was awesome, and you really missed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Thanks, Japh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What a jerk.  Should we wrap things up?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mark is one &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Pippin, I think it&amp;#8217;s pretty close to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So just give a real quick shout out again to our sponsors, NinjaDemo.com.  Go check them out, as well as everything else they do at NinjaForms.com or WPNinjas.com.  A couple of great guys there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	If we could, if you would like to give us a review on iTunes, if you have a plugin or a theme on WordPress.org or anywhere else, we would be happy to take a look at it.  Give you some feedback.  Maybe even leave you a public review as a trade, as a thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	And we also want to thank Shawn Hesketh or @leftlane on Twitter for doing the excellent job that he did with the new Apply Filters intro &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; that you hear on this episode, as well as all upcoming episodes.  And thanks to Frankie and Japh for coming on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Thank you, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Thanks, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We had a little bit of technical problems getting everybody together, but it worked out in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	It was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAPH:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Totally worth it.  Yeah, thanks, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.  Thanks so much, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRANKIE:	Thank you.  &lt;/p&gt;

INTRO:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Now heres your hosts, Pippin Williamson and Brad Touesnard.

BRAD:	Yes, I am Brad Touesnard, and this Episode 18.  This time we have a special guest, Frankie Jarrett, and Japh Thomson is also joining us.  Say hello, guys.

FRANKIE:	Hello.

JAPH:	Hey, everyone.

PIPPIN:	Glad to have you guys onboard.  Real quick before we get started, we just want to give a quick shout out to our sponsors, which is WP Ninjas, and their latest project, Ninja Demo, which is a fantastic new platform theyve created for easily setting up live demos of your plugins and themes.  If you want to create a demo that customers can log into and then view the plugin or the theme in a live sandbox thats unique to that instance, thats what Ninja Demo allows you to do.  You can check it out at NinjaDemo.com.  Ive used it a couple times already and its really pretty slick, so go check it out and see what you think.

BRAD:	Awesome.  Frankie, do you want to start off by just maybe introducing yourself and let us know who you are, what you do?

FRANKIE:	Sure!  Absolutely!  Its good to be here with you guys.  If I can just say, that Ninja Demo thing looks really cool.  

PIPPIN:	Yeah.

FRANKIE:	I was playing around with it, and I thought, wow, this fills a huge need.

PIPPIN:	Yeah, its pretty slick.

FRANKIE:	Yeah.  Yeah, so a little bit about myself.  My name is Frankie Jarrett, and Im a WordPress developer.  I work for X-Team, and Im based in the Kansas City, Missouri area.  Ive been working with WordPress since about somewhere around 2.7, 2.8 release cycle, so its been about six years or so.  When 3.0 came out is when I really decided, okay, WordPress is going to be my platform of choice, and Ive been working in WordPress ever since.  Ive been a core contributor in the past, and now I work full time on a plugin called Stream, which is X-Teams first venture into the plugin space.  Thats been a lot of fun.  Its been a blast working on.  

	My favorite thing, probably, about working on X-Team is just getting to work with my colleagues remotely.  Its a blast just being able to work from home, being able to work with just such amazingly passionate people who are just excited to be doing, you know, the things that we do, developing on WordPress, and sharing that passion with … is fun.

PIPPIN:	Thats a great -- thats one of the great benefits of having a team of people that you work with.

FRANKIE:	For sure.

PIPPIN:	Whether its 5 or 20.  How many people are there on X-Team?

FRANKIE:	On X-Team, X-Team as a whole, theres lots of different teams, I suppose, within X-Team, and so X-Team, as a whole, I would say, is around just over 100 people, but the WordPress X-Team --

PIPPIN:	Holly cow!

FRANKIE:	Yeah.  The WordPress portion of X-Team is about 17 or so developers.  Then our Stream team is even smaller than that since were kind of a bootstrapping startup within that team.  So theres like about four of us, three of us full time.

PIPPIN:	I never realized that X-Team was so big.  I guess Ive always known of X-Team from the WordPress side, and so Im familiar with like the WordPress team of X-Team.  For some reason I always assumed </itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:subtitle>Jared Atchison joins us for Episode 17 to talk about his work, contributing to bbPress, the recent WordPress 3.9 release, and more</itunes:subtitle>
                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Joining us for episode 17 is Jared Atchison, a well-known developer in the WordPress development world with an impressive portfolio of work. Along with learning about Jared&amp;#8217;s day to day work, his recent projects, and what he does on the side, we spend some time discussing WordPress 3.9, the new &lt;a href="http://demowp.pro/" target="_blank"&gt;DemoWP Pro service&lt;/a&gt;, bbPress, and how massive plugin upgrades can be handled well or poorly by the developer or team of developers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-145"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was sponsored by &lt;a href="http://wpninjas.com/"&gt;WP Ninjas&lt;/a&gt;, a leading WordPress plugin development team that is constantly innovating and building excellent tools for the rest of us. Recently they announced their new DemoWP Pro system that allows plugin and theme shops to easily setup live demo environments where potential customers can quickly log in and give the plugin or theme a test drive. In their own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you sell a WordPress plugin or theme? Do you have a demo site that allows potential customers to try out your product? If you don’t, you’re missing a critical tool for reaching customers. If you do, how did you build it? If you’re like most developers, you had to cobble together snippets of found code, backup services, restriction plugins, and prayer. Hoping that the demo would work like some magically imbued golem. Not only is this method sloppy, hard to manage, and a pain in the butt to update, but it doesn’t even make a good demo. What if two users are editing the same part of your demo at the same time? They might think that your plugin is broken because their changes don’t stick. Cross pollination sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://demowp.pro/" target="_blank"&gt;DemoWP PRO&lt;/a&gt; offers a new way for customers to try out your products. Every time a user visits your demo site, they are given a fresh, clean sandbox version of your demo. In this quarantined environment, they can test every nook and cranny of your product without ever messing with anyone else’s data. You can decide how long a sandbox gets to live, and once it’s grown up and reached the end of its life, all traces of its existence disappear from your demo. Much like a sad, disenchanted golem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

PIPPIN:	Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 17 of Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  I&amp;#8217;m your host, Pippin Williamson.  Joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: 	Hey, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And with us today, we have a special guest, Jared Atchison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Howdy, guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.  So today we&amp;#8217;ve got a few things that we want to talk about, and we&amp;#8217;ll jump in.  Primarily we&amp;#8217;re going to let Jared tell us all about himself.  First, we want to give a nice shout out to the WP Ninjas and their new product that they&amp;#8217;re working on launching called DemoWP.  It is a system or it is a plugin that allows you to easily set up a demo environment for your plugins or your themes where potential customers can log in and log into the admin and view all the features of your theme or your plugin in a real environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it&amp;#8217;s DemoWP.pro.  Go check it out.  They&amp;#8217;re going to be launching here within a couple of days.  Sign up for the newsletter, and keep and eye on it.  I played with it today.  It&amp;#8217;s really slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I&amp;#8217;m going to have to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  If you ever sold a plugin or if you&amp;#8217;ve ever sold a theme, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; I mean, we get requests for this all the time where people just went, like, hey, can I have a demo of the plugin?  Do you have a live demo I can log into?  And setting that kind of environment up is really challenging for a variety of reasons.  One, because you have to think about, well, how do I reset my database every couple of days so that people don&amp;#8217;t just see tons of junk data?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that&amp;#8217;s what this takes care of, which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  So it sets up like separate, private kind of environments for each user, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  So I haven&amp;#8217;t seen behind the scenes entirely how it works, but what I&amp;#8217;ve heard from them is that you install it on a multisite setup.  And each time that a user requests a demo, basically they fill out a form, and it generates a demo for them.  It actually creates a new site within the multisite based off of an existing setup.  So it basically clones a site for them, and then they can log into that as an admin of that site with some special privileges and go do anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then that sandbox site gets automatically wiped out after a certain period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s definitely a different take than what I guess we&amp;#8217;ve normally seen for demos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, for sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, I&amp;#8217;ve seen sandboxes before, but it&amp;#8217;s like a kind of catchall where everyone ends up in the same sandbox.  And it&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; just a mess, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  And that&amp;#8217;s how I&amp;#8217;ve always done my demos, maybe because I&amp;#8217;m lazy, and it kind of works.  It usually works for like the first week, and then test users go and muck around with the data enough that it just becomes not very good anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So this one will actually give you, give every single user a unique sandbox from the standard starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  That&amp;#8217;s awesome because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve set these, something like that up before, but it was just on a Cron, so it would just blow stuff away.  So a user could be like in the middle of doing something, and then all of a sudden their data would be wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So not my….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Call it a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I guess so.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s DemoWP.pro.  Go check it out.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.  Jared, you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Do the intro spiel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;m an independent WordPress developer.  I&amp;#8217;ve been working in some capacity with WordPress for probably about the past, oh, seven years or so.  I guess the past five years has been when I&amp;#8217;ve really gotten into the, you know, nitty-gritty, under the hood development type of stuff.  So, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m just a developer.  I do theme work, plugin work, work with bbPress when I can.  I just started doing membership sites recently, I guess, and just kind of, you know, I won&amp;#8217;t say jack of all trades because I don&amp;#8217;t really like that connotation, but just kind of all things WordPress right now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  What are you using for the membership sites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So for the membership sites, I started doing them about six months ago.  And the reason is I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to find kind of a niche to focus on.  Originally about a year and a half ago, I tried getting into bbPress, which I absolutely loved working with.  However, the demand for bbPress isn&amp;#8217;t really that high, so then I decided to take a stab at membership sites.  I follow Chris Lema, and I know that, you know, he kind of predicts that membership sites are up and coming, so I figured that was something for me to take a stab at.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I first got into them probably about six to eight months ago, I tried a variety of different plugins: off course Pippin&amp;#8217;s Restrict Content Pro, Premise, S2.  And so I&amp;#8217;ve kind of &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ve tried a variety of them, and the one that I had settled on, which I&amp;#8217;ve been using recently, was MemberMouse.  And the thing I did find out is they all have their pros and cons, right?  So before I decide on one, I kind of talk to the client and figure out their needs and make sure that we&amp;#8217;re going to put them on the right platform for what they need.  But recently, it&amp;#8217;s been MemberMouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with that said, I&amp;#8217;ve been dying to take a look at the new iThemes Exchange.  The stuff they&amp;#8217;ve added recently has just sounded &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really slick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.  I mean, the whole idea of having the membership sites or the platform and then, of course, you know, there is a degree of ecommerce in there if needed, which sounds really good because I&amp;#8217;ve gotten that request before on membership sites.  And, of course, you know the team, Cory and the crew at iThemes are just, you know, absolutely amazing people.  And I haven&amp;#8217;t looked under the hood of the code yet, but I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s great, and extendable, which that&amp;#8217;s kind of one of the downsides of MemberMouse, I guess, is they&amp;#8217;re not WordPress folks.  They&amp;#8217;re kind of like enterprise coders, which has its pros and cons.  But one of the cons is a lot of the things they do kind of isn&amp;#8217;t the WordPress way.  So when I need to extend stuff, it just takes a little bit more time to get familiar with their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  They don&amp;#8217;t have nearly as many hooks or filters in their collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	…with &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Eric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Eric from MemberMouse recently because I was doing an integration with my Affiliate WP plugin.  I wanted to really easily track referrals on new membership signups and things like that.  And it took me a while to figure it out because I didn&amp;#8217;t have those standard hooks and filters.  But it turns out that there was a way to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The nice thing about Eric and MemberMouse is that he&amp;#8217;s super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	He&amp;#8217;s super smart too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And he told me, like, any time if you have a filter in action, you need to just tell me.  They&amp;#8217;re not necessarily things that we intuitively add, but if there&amp;#8217;s ever a clear reason to have one, more than happy to add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, and that&amp;#8217;s kind of why I went and in the past I&amp;#8217;ve been using MemberMouse is so I originally started out using Premise, which I won&amp;#8217;t really go into that, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have great experiences with that at all.  So after kind of getting burned on that and shifting to something else, then I just wanted like the, you know, I guess MemberMouse is kind of considered the Cadillac.  They have the most &amp;#8212; even though they take away some of the extendibility, they offer like kind of the most out of the box, I guess, by the up-sells and the down-sells and all that type of stuff.  So I&amp;#8217;ve really been pushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s a super … for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve really been pushing that recently, but I think on my next project, unless there&amp;#8217;s some feature that doesn&amp;#8217;t let me, I&amp;#8217;m really going to try out Exchange.  I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward to that, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Have either of you guys tried Memberful?  The Theme Foundry guys, I think do that one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	No, I haven&amp;#8217;t.  Chris has talked about it a little bit, but I honestly haven&amp;#8217;t ever really used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I haven&amp;#8217;t actually played with the system yet.  We are looking at integrating with it for Affiliate WP.  It&amp;#8217;s a little different though, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s more of a SAS, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s like a hosted service, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, exactly.  That was my understanding anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure how it works in terms of like providing the membership content.  But it&amp;#8217;s definitely something, considering who is behind Theme Foundry; it&amp;#8217;s obviously something that should be looked at because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The Theme Foundry being behind it is good enough for me to go take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  Those guys just scream quality, right, like the stuff they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  They&amp;#8217;re pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s the thing.  I mean, I think right now that people who need a membership site, they&amp;#8217;re probably in the best position that they&amp;#8217;ve been in, you know, ever, right?  I mean, there are some really solid platforms out there now depending on your needs.  I mean, Chris has covered those in depth on his site and has even done some infographics that help you decide which one is potentially the best for your needs or whatever.  But if you look at the state of those platforms now versus like three years ago, right, all you had was Wishlist, S2, and a couple other things.  You were basically screwed.  At least now you have some alternatives that, you know, are fairly robust.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, three years ago is right about when I started building RCP.  And that&amp;#8217;s why I built it because I was &amp;#8212; because I wanted to run a membership site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	And you knew better to use what else was out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  And also, I also worked for a company that was running a big membership site, and they were running on A-Member at the time, and we really wanted to get them off of A-Member.  And now they&amp;#8217;re still running RCP, and it&amp;#8217;s working great for them.  I do really like that now there are a lot of options when it comes to memberships because there is no one size fits all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, I think that&amp;#8217;s part of the problem that we used to have with membership systems is that the systems that were available were trying to be one size fits all.  And from a developer standpoint, I really don&amp;#8217;t like that mentality.  I have no problem telling somebody that, hey, RCP is not for you, or MemberMouse is not for you, or this is the one that you should be using because that&amp;#8217;s always going to create a better experience &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; for the user and the customers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Well, we know what happens when you bolt on the kitchen sink, right?  We were just talking about that yesterday on some plugin I won&amp;#8217;t mention.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, I know the one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It doesn&amp;#8217;t take much to figure it out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I really &amp;#8212; I haven&amp;#8217;t looked at the membership portion of iThemes Exchange, but I&amp;#8217;ve played with the code base of the base plugin, and it&amp;#8217;s really nice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I think they kind of are taking to the model of what you said, right.  Instead of trying to do the kitchen sink, they&amp;#8217;re just picking out selective features, that kind of 80/20 rule and just doing them well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	They are doing them really well.  I&amp;#8217;m not going to lie.  Some of their features with the membership stuff makes me jealous because I&amp;#8217;m like, man, I would like to do that.  And I&amp;#8217;m like, ah, you know what?  There&amp;#8217;s not enough time.  But that&amp;#8217;s okay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  So, Jared, do you do &amp;#8212; do you release plugins on the .org repo?  Do you have any plugins…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I sure do.  It&amp;#8217;s not something I do as much as I would like to because a lot of the cool stuff I write is really just made specifically for a project or a client.  So to go back and kind of like rework that code to make it generic or, you know, to work in general use case, a lot of times I just don&amp;#8217;t have the time to do that.  But I do have plugins on .org.  My user name is JaredAtch.  Let&amp;#8217;s see.  I&amp;#8217;m looking at them.  A lot of them are actually bbPress plugins because, from all the bbPress work I was doing about a year ago.  And, at the time, I had a couple clients that were using it fairly heavily, so I did some bbPress plugins.  But, yeah, so there&amp;#8217;s a few there to check out.  Not a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I still use your bbPress new topic notifications every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Excellent.  Yeah, see that was actually &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	[Indiscernible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That was actually kind of an example of what we just talked about, right?  Like I put it up, and it did just like exactly what I wanted to do and nothing else.  And then first people started requesting all these new features like, oh, we want to be able to segment this and like only put notifications if this happens.  And I&amp;#8217;m like, no, I&amp;#8217;m not doing that.  Like, I just want it to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, and then people started like doing one star drive-bys like it needs more features.  You know, screw you, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I totally understand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	But, yeah, so one of the actual new features that I&amp;#8217;ve had pretty good or new plugin, sorry, that I&amp;#8217;ve had good reception on is one called basic user avatars.  And basically it&amp;#8217;s a fork of tin-ups or Jake Goldman&amp;#8217;s old, simple, user avatar, I think is what it was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	And I took the old version and basically added front-end bbPress support into it because that was one of the things that, as a bbPress user, kind of annoyed me that there was no easy way for users to set an avatar on the forums.  They had to either sign up for a gravatar or you had to like give them back WP admin access, so they could use one of the existing plugins.  It just wasn&amp;#8217;t a good user experience whatsoever.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	[Indiscernible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So I took the existing plugin, forked it, and now you can just manage your avatar from the bbPress profile screen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sweet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	This is a new one to me.  I had no idea that you&amp;#8217;d written this.  Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s actually something that I need to put on my support forms because we&amp;#8217;ve had users come in, like, I want to change my avatar.  Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, and then you tell them, like … avatar, and sign up.  You know, it&amp;#8217;s just not worth it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, it&amp;#8217;s totally not worth it, and it&amp;#8217;s not worth it for the user either unless they already use gravatar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Exactly.  Well, yeah, try it out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	[Indiscernible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I mean, if you have any problems, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I have a question for you, Pippin.  Did you &amp;#8212; you know that email that everyone &amp;#8212; any plugin author should have gotten an email that said &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; you should update the compatible &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, for WordPress 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  Is that new, or did I just not see it before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So I thought that too.  I don&amp;#8217;t recall ever, or at least not recently, for a major release, getting that email until this one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it&amp;#8217;s new because that was the first time I had seen it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It worked.  I did it.  It worked for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But, honestly, I haven&amp;#8217;t done it yet.  But I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It just takes forever to go through 50 plugins and update them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I know.  I always think of it when a new release comes out, and then I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8212; and then I immediately forget to do it or whatever.  But I feel like the email just nudged me that little bit extra, just enough, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I liked it.  I thought it was, whether you choose to do it or not, it&amp;#8217;s still that nice reminder that says, hey, by the way, you have these plugins that either you should test them or at least update whether they&amp;#8217;re compatible or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  No, I liked it.  It&amp;#8217;s good.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Jared, have you ever done any contribution to WordPress Core?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I have not, not directly.  I mean, I don&amp;#8217;t have props on any tickets.  I&amp;#8217;ve been involved in numerous tickets, one that talks about the metabox stuff, one that talks about bundling jQuery UI.  I&amp;#8217;ve done &amp;#8212; reported bugs that I&amp;#8217;ve gotten fixed and stuff, but I have never directly submitted a patch.  There&amp;#8217;s no real reason why.  I guess I just &amp;#8212; when I have time to do stuff like that, I&amp;#8217;d rather contribute to bbPress, honestly, is what it kind of came down to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Yeah.  I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not easy to contribute to Core, really, like to get things through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I mean &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Unless you just happen to jump on a ticket that has a simple patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which usually….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I mean, so my idea was if I ever came across a problem that was, you know, something stupid that no one else had found yet and, you know, I could do a quick fix, I would definitely patch it and, you know, push that upstream or try to.  But my thought was, you know, if I have free time to just sit around and, you know, kind of donate my time towards something, I ended up just doing bbPress.  I mean, I haven&amp;#8217;t been really involved in probably the past 6 to 12 months actively just because I&amp;#8217;ve been so busy with paid client work.  But for a while there, you know, I was a core contributor and was help leading the dev chats and everything like that.  And, I mean, I always, in my talks going to WordCamps when I was talking on bbPress, I&amp;#8217;d encourage people, you know, look; it&amp;#8217;s not like don&amp;#8217;t contribute to WordPress Core, but if you haven&amp;#8217;t started that, why not consider bbPress?  The barrier to entry is a lot lower, and the developers there will work with you and help you with your patches and everything, which is something that WordPress Core is getting better at, but they&amp;#8217;re still not, you know, there&amp;#8217;s still that kind of barrier to entry.  And, of course the load on &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, and I think there&amp;#8217;s a barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, and then the code on bbPress is like pristine, right?  I mean, so what better way to learn the code than go through the code at bbPress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more.  bbPress is definitely where I started too.  I was contributing to bbPress Core for at least a year, a year and a half before I ever really started thinking about contributing to WordPress Core, and it was because of that barrier to entry.  And I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s necessarily because developers are more responsive, but there&amp;#8217;s a couple things.  You mentioned the code is pristine.  WordPress has a ton of legacy code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So if you get into some of those legacy parts, it can be difficult, either because it&amp;#8217;s difficult to interpret what&amp;#8217;s going on, or because changing it is a backwards compatibility nightmare.  One of the nice things with bbPress for sure is that because it was all rewritten from the ground up like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; what, a year and a half, two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s beautiful, especially because Jtrip is crazy when it comes to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Like super….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; how clean this code is going to be.  I mean, it&amp;#8217;s all pristine for sure.  And so it&amp;#8217;s definitely easier to get into read it, to find where things are happening and, overall, I&amp;#8217;d say it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of a &amp;#8212; I mean, it&amp;#8217;s a simpler system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Well, and part of it for me was, you know, when I would submit a patch, and this might have been just because, you know, there&amp;#8217;s not as much going on, right?  So the noise is a lot lower.  But when I first got started with bbPress, you know, I would submit a patch and Jacoby, John James Jacoby, the, I guess, kind of the guy who runs that and BuddyPress.  You know, he&amp;#8217;s kind of the gatekeeper for all that.  And he would take my patch and be like, yeah, this looks like a good start, and then would just commit a different patch that was like 90% rewritten, right?  But the beauty of that was like he&amp;#8217;d let me compare what I submitted to like what he ended up with.  Okay, well, this makes sense why he changed this.  This makes sense.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versus you don&amp;#8217;t really see that a lot on WordPress Core, at least not that I see.  Most of the time if they don&amp;#8217;t like your patch they&amp;#8217;re just like, no.  You know what I mean?  They don&amp;#8217;t really take the time to go through and say, like, okay, well, that&amp;#8217;s pretty good, but here we&amp;#8217;re going to walk you through a few things and show you what you could have done differently.  And for me, in bbPress, that&amp;#8217;s what I absolutely loved is, I mean, my &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Getting that immediate, quality feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, exactly.  And then my next patch was better.  And then my next patch was better.  And, you know, finally my last patch is like, you know, Jacoby was like, yep, looks good to me; going in, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	But it&amp;#8217;s because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I had the exact same experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It&amp;#8217;s because you worked with me, I got to that level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think &amp;#8212; so why do you think that is then?  Like why is WordPress &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Just the size of the project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I think so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	…the size, the lack of noise.  I mean, if you look at the number of tickets in the bbPress Trac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s so much smaller.  Some of that is because the project is, I mean, the project itself is much smaller.  There are fewer people contributing to it.  There are fewer people reporting bugs.  It&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to manage tickets in the bbPress Trac than it is in WordPress simply because of size.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And instead of having, say, ten people that are the leaders of the project, you have one or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I guess technically there&amp;#8217;s three or four that are more or less leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	No, I think there&amp;#8217;s three or four core committers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s Jtrip, Jennifer, and Daniel, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Are the three.  But in general, you still have much more rapid feedback and just the ease of reviewing a ticket is a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Exactly.  So that&amp;#8217;s why, you know, when people are looking to get started, you know, if you want to go work with WordPress Core, by all means.  But, you know, if you&amp;#8217;re looking for more immediate feedback then &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	&amp;#8211; bbPress is definitely a good place to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s definitely a nice intro into like how contributing to WordPress Core works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I think so because you get used to Trac.  I mean, Jacoby runs, you know, the bbPress Trac very similar to Core, obviously just on a much smaller scale.  So it&amp;#8217;s very easy, and it&amp;#8217;s getting better now that Nacin has spent a lot of time like reworking the Core Trac and everything.  But it&amp;#8217;s very easy to just, you know, get overwhelmed with Trac, right?  Like not know what the hell is going on.  There are just all the tags and everything like that.  And bbPress, like you said, is such a smaller project that I think it is a good first step to, you know, kind of get familiar with how things work and then, you know, six months of doing that and creating patches, well then it&amp;#8217;s hop over to WordPress Core, you know, is really nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Should we move on to maybe, Pippin, do you want to talk about what you&amp;#8217;ve been up to these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, let&amp;#8217;s hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  Sure.  So my recent thing that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on, aside from my standard day-to-day work with Easy Digital Downloads and some other stuff, is we finally got Affiliate WP launched and out the door, so that was fun.  We launched it a week and a half &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;d play like a sound effect, but we don&amp;#8217;t have any sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, we fail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It would have been like clapping and like a hurray, like a crowd applauding, so you can kind of imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Now I&amp;#8217;m sad and disappointed.  But we got that launched just a little bit over a week ago, and we&amp;#8217;ve had a really great response to it so far.  It&amp;#8217;s been fun for me, aside from &amp;#8211;I always like launching a new plugin.  But it&amp;#8217;s been really fun for me because I&amp;#8217;ve stepped back on this project and modified my role quite a bit.  I&amp;#8217;ve always been hands-on with every aspect of a project that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on, and so that means that I&amp;#8217;m doing the development.  I&amp;#8217;m doing the support.  I&amp;#8217;m doing the site.  I&amp;#8217;m doing the marketing, et cetera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for this one, I have Andrew Monroe, who&amp;#8217;s been a long time EDD contributor.  He&amp;#8217;s been working with me on it.  And we agreed to split our roles up, so I&amp;#8217;m doing nothing but development, and he&amp;#8217;s doing all of the support and all of the site.  And it&amp;#8217;s been really fun for the last week or so to be able to just focus on fixing bugs, making improvements, et cetera, as opposed to working with initial customer support, working getting the site up and going, and things like that.  And I think it&amp;#8217;s allowed the project to move dramatically faster and have the end result be a lot better and a lot more polished, so that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Affiliate WP, I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with writing a Pebble app, so I bought a Pebble, the Smart Watch, a month or so ago.  And I decided I wanted to try and write an app for it, and so I wanted to write an app that would allow me to quickly view like my current sales stats for a day from one of my sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I could open the app, and it would do a quick query to the API and say you&amp;#8217;ve made X number of dollars today, or something like that.  And it&amp;#8217;s not finished, but I did get it mostly working in the dev environment, and that was really fun.  I&amp;#8217;ve never, aside from like ten years ago, I haven&amp;#8217;t worked with C ever.  So writing in C was new.  And then figuring out the SDK and then, and honestly, like seeing something happen on my watch that I just programmed was pretty frickin&amp;#8217; cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  It sounds like fun.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I mostly just did it for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I did a C course in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, me too.  Good God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I did C++ in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, mine was Unix based C, so it was like the projects were like, you know, build a server that would fire off child processes and do other things and stuff.  I found it really cool.  I really enjoyed it.  But I could see, so why did yours suck, Jared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It was just our instructor was really hard.  Actually, it was funny because, you know, I took this in college, and I had to take a programming elective, and my choices were like, it was something stupid.  It was C, Pascal, or Fortran.  And I&amp;#8217;m like, well, let&amp;#8217;s see which one is actually going to be, you know, even remotely useful to me.  So I ended up taking C, and I actually liked the course itself because having basic PHP knowledge already, I made a ton of connections.  I mean, I was leaps and bounds ahead of most of the people in the course who just had no idea what they were doing just because the functions were somewhat similar named and whatnot, so I really liked it.  But, yeah, it was just a tough course.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean, the professor makes such a difference, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah, exactly.  And he was one of those professors that, you know, didn&amp;#8217;t really give a shit about everyone in his class being lazy and had no problem just failing everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Isn&amp;#8217;t that like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	[Indiscernible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Isn&amp;#8217;t that like the Steve Jobs thing?  Isn&amp;#8217;t that like don&amp;#8217;t take courses, take professors, or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I think that&amp;#8217;s a pretty smart way to say it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I wish I still had time to do stuff like that though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The C++ class that I took in college was, it was terrible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was taught by a grad student that had no idea how to teach a programming class, and it was a little painful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah, that&amp;#8217;s too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I managed to get through it without ever buying the textbook, which I was pretty happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ah, yeah, typical student scheming right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was like, you know what?  I know programming.  I&amp;#8217;m going to see what I can do.  I&amp;#8217;m going to get through.  I&amp;#8217;m not going to buy this darn textbook.  It&amp;#8217;s going to cost me $150.  Screw that.  And there was definitely times I was like, man, I should have just bought the damn textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But, hey, I made it through.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Actually, yeah, there was no textbook for my Unix C course because, like, there&amp;#8217;s man pages and stuff, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ll be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think the idea of a programming textbook is kind of stupid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s something wrong with the program language if it doesn&amp;#8217;t have just proper documentation.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, well, and like in my case, the course was pretty much reading from the textbook, chapter by chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So I just thought about it.  So that programming class was actually the reason I got my very first Mac ever.  I was a die-hard PC person, was really familiar with Windows XP, and was actually a computer tech, so I knew all that.  And, yeah, so for the C stuff to compile it and everything, you either had to, you know, have a Unix or Mac based system or had to put, you know, Putty or something similar on your PC and then like SSH or Telnet into their servers and like do all your programming there and try to compile it and everything.  And so the off, for whatever reason, was always screwing up, and I could never connect to their servers and everything, so I was like screw it.  I&amp;#8217;m a student.  You know, I get like a 15% off discount at the Apple store.  Went down there, got me just an old school white Mac book.  I think it was the first generation Intel core dual or whatever and, yeah, I started using that to compile my C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	And then I just eventually ended up switching over completely.  So I guess I have then the C class to thank for that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There you go.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So what else have you been working on lately, Jared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Just a whole lot of little things.  I mean right now I&amp;#8217;m actually working on redoing the ShareASell blog, which I&amp;#8217;m pretty excited about having that project as can be.  They&amp;#8217;ve been great so far, so I&amp;#8217;ve been doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s a pretty high profile project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Exactly.  That&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m counting on.  It&amp;#8217;s going to look good in my portfolio, so right now I&amp;#8217;m actually building the custom event calendar for them, so that&amp;#8217;s kind of been my last few days, and it&amp;#8217;s been a real interesting process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Does that mean that you have to use ShareASell for your affiliate system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Does that mean you have to use ShareASell for your affiliate systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	…yeah, so ShareASell is really what I&amp;#8217;ve been working on the past week or two.  That&amp;#8217;s hopefully going to be done in the next week.  And then right before I left for vacation last month, we launched the new LeadPages site, which is leadpages.net, and that was a pretty massive sized project, so that took up quite a bit of time working on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	When you work on these, are you usually working by yourself, or do you have other people that you work with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	No, usually it&amp;#8217;s just me and the client, and that&amp;#8217;s it or, you know, if there&amp;#8217;s a designer looped in.  But as far as developers, I&amp;#8217;m typically the only person.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Do you do the front-end coding as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I do.  I do.  So sometimes there&amp;#8217;ll be projects where I just get so many templates and there&amp;#8217;s just a ton of work that I need to do on the backend.  I&amp;#8217;ll actually contract out some of the front-end stuff just so I can focus on the backend stuff.  But that&amp;#8217;s very rare.  I only do that for really large projects where, you know, there&amp;#8217;s a lot to do for me on the backend that&amp;#8217;s going to keep me from doing the front-end stuff.  But typically I just knock it all out myself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s very cool.  Nice.  What about you, Brad?  What have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, I had MicoConf, which is a business conference.  I guess it was last week, and I spent a couple days vacationing in Las Vegas &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; just before the conference.  Yeah, and it was awesome.  It was so good.  I love talking business.  And there are just a lot of passionate people there, and it was kind of a small conference, about 300 people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Those are the best though, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, it was.  I just &amp;#8212; my only regret is that I kind of bounced around too much, I think.  I just wanted to talk to everyone, right?  But it was &amp;#8212; it ended up being &amp;#8212; you know, it&amp;#8217;s one of those things, like when I got home, I had so many things to do and catch up on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I was like that&amp;#8217;s the sign of a good conference because there was no time where I was working or, like, doing other things.  I was absorbing the conference, you know.  So that&amp;#8217;s kind of like PressNomics is similar, I think, to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I was behind for several weeks after PressNomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  But before MicoConf, I released a little bit of code on GitHub.  So I wrote an article about filtering your logs.  So like if you&amp;#8217;re developing and you have a plugin installed that&amp;#8217;s like polluting your log, your error log with all these errors that, you know, it&amp;#8217;s a third party plug-in, so you can&amp;#8217;t really fix those errors, right?  But you can filter them out of your error log.  So I wrote an article about that.  And the problem is that the solution that I came up with in that article didn&amp;#8217;t work when you had XDebug enabled.  So I released some code to kind of filter out an Xdebug log. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So that&amp;#8217;s like really specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It&amp;#8217;s pretty wild though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah, but just check out the article, I guess, and you&amp;#8217;ll see kind of why it&amp;#8217;s useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Too long….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, TLDR.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  It&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.  I was just taking a look at it, and I mean it&amp;#8217;s definitely an issue that I&amp;#8217;ve run into before, but honestly I probably never would have thought to jump in and say, hey, let&amp;#8217;s take care of this.  Instead, I&amp;#8217;m the lazy developer that just says, ah, screw it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Also I&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I wrote an article like a couple weeks ago about &amp;#8212; the title was Stop Commenting Just to Say You Did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, God, the comments on that were awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And it went nuts on Hacker News.  It hit the front page and stuff.  But the funny thing is with Hacker News is that it really doesn&amp;#8217;t do anything for you.  It brings a lot of traffic to your site, but like no one signs up for your email list and, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, it&amp;#8217;s usually the wrong kind of customer base or user base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so I&amp;#8217;ve gotten on like the front page of Hacker News like three times already this year, somehow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Good for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And just, well, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; but that&amp;#8217;s it.  That&amp;#8217;s all it is.  It&amp;#8217;s like a vanity thing.  It&amp;#8217;s like can I make the front page of Hacker News, because there&amp;#8217;s really no benefit besides &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; being able to say that you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Just to say you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, which is kind of stupid, right?  So I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;m going to submit my articles anymore, but I&amp;#8217;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m going to try to resist.  Sometimes you just want to know, right, like is this going to resonate, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I mean, I thought it was an interesting article.  I was reading the comments, and I was kind of siding in the middle of it, right?  So I don&amp;#8217;t know if you all talked about the article last week or last week, but it was basically just like don&amp;#8217;t comment for the sake of comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Commenting.  And I don&amp;#8217;t know.  Personally, I guess I kind of end up kind of putting in pointless comments sometimes, but they&amp;#8217;re more of like placeholder comments that I&amp;#8217;m supposed to go back and expand on later, and then a lot of times I just don&amp;#8217;t do it.  But it was a good article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I guess my argument there was that it&amp;#8217;s like if you do that then you end up with like &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s really hard to identify the meaningful comments when there&amp;#8217;s a lot of stub comments, right?  That was my point I was getting at.  But people kind of brought up the idea of like Javadoc, whatever those things are, the documentation generators, like they need those stubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, they have to have the doc block for every function, even if like it&amp;#8217;s pointless just to be able to generate the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that seems ridiculous to me.  That seems like a problem with your doc generator more than &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.  Have you ever seen a plugin that&amp;#8217;s like click here to see your docs?  And you click it, and then all it is is the auto-generated documentation from the dock blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I hate it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And then I immediately hit the back button.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.  Is that not the most like stupidest thing?  I mean, uh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I mean, in terms of developer documentation, it&amp;#8217;s pretty much worthless.  Why don&amp;#8217;t you instead just link to GitHub and go to the code base?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I mean it&amp;#8217;s pretty much the same thing except for: oh, wait, you don&amp;#8217;t have code in there.  All you get to see is comments.  Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, and the comments generally don&amp;#8217;t, unless you&amp;#8217;re like bbPress, you know, and you just put all this crap in your comments that help you learn how to use the functions and stuff.  The doc blocks usually don&amp;#8217;t really tell you that much.  You&amp;#8217;re going to end up going and looking through everything anyway, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, no.  They&amp;#8217;re silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sometimes they&amp;#8217;re kind of cool just to see whether or not you have your doc blocks written out well enough, but beyond that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve never found one that I thought was useful for me as a developer not familiar with a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, same here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And, I mean, honestly, that&amp;#8217;s what developer documentation is supposed to be is for people to become familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We&amp;#8217;ve got a little bit of time left.  Why don&amp;#8217;t we talk real quick about WordPress 3.9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So 3.9 dropped a week and a half ago, something like that and, overall, I love 3.9.  I think it&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So you&amp;#8217;ve updated all your sites and everything as far as you&amp;#8217;re concerned, or are you kind of holding off and only…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, I&amp;#8217;ve got everything updated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Actually, no.  There&amp;#8217;s on site I don&amp;#8217;t have updated, which is a client site.  And the only reason we haven&amp;#8217;t updated them is because we have a very strict schedule on when we perform their updates just because of the size of their site and availability of people if something goes wrong during the update of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Here&amp;#8217;s why &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We can&amp;#8217;t just throw thousands of dollars down the drain if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Here&amp;#8217;s why I haven&amp;#8217;t updated one of my sites: because I&amp;#8217;m not confident that the plugins that I have installed have done &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	thorough enough testing yet and I&amp;#8217;ve worked out all the bugs.  And that&amp;#8217;s why I just don&amp;#8217;t have the trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I think I&amp;#8217;m in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What are some of those &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Not necessarily what are the plugins, but what are the issues that you expect those plugins to have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So I&amp;#8217;m running &amp;#8212; so I guess the big thing is I&amp;#8217;m running an ecommerce site: deliciousbrains.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So if anything breaks, you know, I lose money and have a hard time paying my employees and, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s a disaster, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, that&amp;#8217;s pretty much the same reason that this client site, we haven&amp;#8217;t updated them yet.  We have updated their staging site, and basically we&amp;#8217;re letting their staging site run for a week or two to make sure that everything is running fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so far it&amp;#8217;s all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve updated my blog and, I mean, but that&amp;#8217;s not much, right?  Most of it&amp;#8217;s a static site anyway, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I do have to say one really nice thing about running an ecommerce system that you wrote is that you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about whether your ecommerce system works on 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because you already know if it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly.  That&amp;#8217;s a very good point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I guess it&amp;#8217;s a nice, little position to be in.  But, yeah, all of my sites are on 3.9, and I&amp;#8217;m really happy.  I have not had any issues with anything.  I have seen some people or some pretty widespread issues when it comes to TinyMCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yep, I&amp;#8217;ve had clients yell at me about that already.  It&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, TinyMCE 4.0, so there&amp;#8217;s a lot of plugins, primarily plugins that added buttons to the TinyMCE toolbar.  Some of those failed with 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It&amp;#8217;s not even they don&amp;#8217;t; it&amp;#8217;s not even they fail in the sense that like they don&amp;#8217;t show up, which would be acceptable because then they&amp;#8217;d just reappear when the plugin fixes itself.  It&amp;#8217;s that the cases I&amp;#8217;ve seen with some of my clients, they just nuke the WYSIWYG altogether.  So they log in, and they&amp;#8217;re just like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, that&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	&amp;#8211; the WYSIWYG just doesn&amp;#8217;t load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So, yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a lot more inconvenient than like, oh, you know, the whatever …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, you don&amp;#8217;t have formatting….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	…button doesn&amp;#8217;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  Yeah, that wouldn&amp;#8217;t be as big of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Have you tracked down the reason for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I haven&amp;#8217;t.  I do know one of the plugins was the zip list recipe plugin, I guess, and that was like a known thing documented on .org, so I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll push a release out for that if they haven&amp;#8217;t already, but yeah, it was just weird.  It was nuking the editor entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I would assume that&amp;#8217;s just because of the difference between the previous version of TinyMCE and 4.0 &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; with how buttons are added.  I mean it&amp;#8217;s just causing a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That does bring up a point that I want to make because I think it&amp;#8217;s really important.  I had a conversation with a plugin developer last week.  They had written a plugin, and it broke with 3.9 due to TinyMCE.  And to put it this way, they were pretty much PO&amp;#8217;d at WordPress for breaking their plugin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I kind of wanted to say, &amp;#8220;Shut up and just deal with it,&amp;#8221; because &amp;#8212; so first of all, you write a plugin for a platform.  So it is your responsibility as the developer of that plugin to make sure that you work with that platform.  And I think that&amp;#8217;s something that most plugin developers, in general, understand, at least the greatest ones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	You mean the competent ones, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I mean that whole argument is a farce to me.  I mean, if you wrote something that was on jQuery three years ago and now the new version breaks, are you going to be like, well, it&amp;#8217;s jQuery&amp;#8217;s fault, you know, I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, exactly.  But beyond that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Or iOS or something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But aside from that, I think it&amp;#8217;s really, really important that plugin developers understand that especially if they are running a business with their plugins.  If you give plugins away for free, and you don&amp;#8217;t want to test them with prereleases, you know, that&amp;#8217;s fine.  You&amp;#8217;ve given away a free plugin.  That&amp;#8217;s awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	But if you run a business off of your plugins, either selling plugins or it&amp;#8217;s a service of some kind, F&amp;#8217;ing-A, test it prerelease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	WordPress 3.9 was in beta for like, what, four weeks?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And was very publicly announced.  Hey, RC1 is going out.  RC2 is going out.  Beta 1, et cetera.  We&amp;#8217;re all going: all of these announcements were made.  There were very clear blog posts.  It was very public.  And yet here as soon as 3.9 comes out, a whole bunch of plugin developers come in, oh, crap, my stuff broke.  Ah, well, you&amp;#8217;re running a business on this, and it&amp;#8217;s your responsibility to know that you should be testing this and to not do that is entirely negligent to you and your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.  I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re a premium plugin-er, you&amp;#8217;re taking money, then I think you definitely have that responsibility.  That&amp;#8217;s just ridiculous if you don&amp;#8217;t, you know.  If I was a user of that plugin, I&amp;#8217;d be pretty pissed off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.  And if you choose to not test the RC versions, whatever.  But when you discover that something is broken, don&amp;#8217;t ever try and blame WordPress Core for it.  Don&amp;#8217;t ever go ranting off that something broke because you didn&amp;#8217;t test a beta version.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I think we started &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We had the same mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	We started testing &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	It&amp;#8217;s same mentality for ecommerce sites that don&amp;#8217;t have staging areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So, Pippin, it must be like a massive undertaking for you guys because you have so many plugins, like the add-ons for EDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, what do you all &amp;#8212; how do you all deal with so many add-ons and making sure that they comply with all the updates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	To be honest, we don&amp;#8217;t test them every update.  What we do instead, which I think actually works really well, is when we have an add-on that is going into the review system, before we ever publicize it to the store, we basically make sure that it&amp;#8217;s not doing anything that&amp;#8217;s going to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	I gotcha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So if it&amp;#8217;s using &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	By the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If it&amp;#8217;s using an API that&amp;#8217;s not stable, or it&amp;#8217;s using something that we know is going to change, we say don&amp;#8217;t use it.  Use reliable systems.  In general, APIs in WordPress and hopefully APIs in your platforms, in this case would be like EDD, hopefully they&amp;#8217;re stable and they&amp;#8217;re there to stay, and so that people should be able to rely on them.  And so as the project manager, if we know that, hey, this API in EDD is not going to be here anymore or is changing, we make sure that it gets deprecated early and that new extensions are not allowed to use it.  And so a lot of it is being cognizant of what future problems might happen.  And so far that&amp;#8217;s been awesome, and we&amp;#8217;ve had very few extensions break due to WordPress Core updates or EDD updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s good, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think, over the course of two years, we&amp;#8217;ve had three or four extensions that failed after an update for some reason.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	That&amp;#8217;s a pretty low failure rate there &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	&amp;#8211; given how many updates and extensions that have been in play there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think a lot of it is because of that, the idea of, hey, let&amp;#8217;s make sure that before something is released that it&amp;#8217;s stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There must be some plugins that you have, like the more complex ones, that you must test a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like the software add-on and there&amp;#8217;s probably a couple others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I mean, a lot of the core ones that we use, like I use them day-to-day on the EDD store itself and on my personal store and some other stores.  And so they&amp;#8217;re getting tested every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think the ones for this particular discussion are more like the popular ones that we don&amp;#8217;t use, but we still want to test them before release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But most of the really popular ones that we&amp;#8217;d have to worry about those are being constantly developed anyway, so that, I mean, that is our testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So speaking of plugins and updates, I wanted to get you all&amp;#8217;s opinion on something real quick.  I don&amp;#8217;t know if you all &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	&amp;#8211; were involved in this kind of Twitter stream going back and forth yesterday.  So you all are familiar with the advanced custom fields plugin, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So I used that on a good, fair number of my sites, and on many of those sites you use some of the premium add-ons, which are like the repeater field, the gallery field, the options page field and a few other things.  So Elliott, the developer, is a great guy.  All his updates and stuff, for the most part, are usually typically pretty solid and well tested, has been working on a new version, 5.0, which is right now in beta and going to have a bunch of some speed improvements and things are done with ajax to not, you know, bring down your site if you&amp;#8217;re using a select box that has 1,000 posts and stuff like that.  So, overall, it&amp;#8217;s going to be, you know, it looks to be a good update.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The problem being is, at least as of a few days ago is, the way he was thinking about handling the update.  So the way it is now is, 4.0, the 4.0 release, you can just download off .org, and then you go to the advanced customs field site.  You purchase your paid add-ons, and then, you know, you just activate those separately on your site, and everything just works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Well, what he&amp;#8217;s going to do now with 5.0 is basically have a pro-release, so you have a lite version that&amp;#8217;s going to be on .org, and then you have a pro version that you install, put in a serial, activate, and it just has all of the add-ons in it already, so there&amp;#8217;s not any of this, you know, going and managing two different things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So the issue with this is his upgrade path that he was thinking about doing, and I&amp;#8217;m hoping he&amp;#8217;s going to consider, and it sounds like he might, is so when 5.0 hits and, you know, your users are going to go in and be like, oh, yeah, update.  Update.  Well, it&amp;#8217;s going to update to 5.0 lite.  And so you&amp;#8217;re going to lose your premium add-ons until you know that you need to go in there and put in the serial key and activate the pro version to basically get the new versions of the add-on back, which, you know, my clients won&amp;#8217;t do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So basically, you know, it&amp;#8217;s going to be….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I know why he&amp;#8217;s doing &amp;#8212; I know why he&amp;#8217;s doing that too.  I know why because you can&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; he won&amp;#8217;t be &amp;#8212; he wants to get his pro code out of the .org repo, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And so updating the .org plugin, that&amp;#8217;s really the only way that he&amp;#8217;s going to be able to do that.  I can&amp;#8217;t even think off the top of my head how he would go about it any other way.  Like what&amp;#8217;s the alternative?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I guess the shitty thing is it seems it&amp;#8217;s a crappy situation to be in because you can say, well, this is the model that, for whatever reason, it needs to go to for the future.  How do we get people to that model?  I don&amp;#8217;t have an answer for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But for people like you and other people that are managing client sites, that&amp;#8217;s pretty crappy for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.  I mean, like me and Bill Erickson and Travis Northcutt and some other people were talking about it and, like, I mean, we&amp;#8217;d just flat out be screwed, right?  Like, I mean, the three of us combined probably have hundreds of sites using that plugin, most of which are using the premium add-ons.  And so for when that update hits, you know, all the clients are just going to go in and hit update and not really know any better.  And then all of a sudden a core functionality that, you know, like the repeater field or the gallery field just breaks.  And they don&amp;#8217;t know that, like, well, shit, I should have bought a pro version, and I should have gone and put in that license first.  And so I think it&amp;#8217;s going to….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I guess my argument there would be like: should clients be updating plugins anyway because, like, the shit could break anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Personally, I think they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	They should be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I think that&amp;#8217;s a different discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So from a product manager&amp;#8217;s perspective, a couple things: number one, I think any decision that is going to cause 50%, 90%, 20% of your user base to break is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	A decision, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No matter what the goal is to get to, I think that&amp;#8217;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And there has to be a better way around it.  I don&amp;#8217;t know what the answer is for how to get around it.  I&amp;#8217;m not super familiar with the plugin or how that ecosystem has worked.  But I think, with a commercial product, choosing an upgrade path that results in major failure is wrong, regardless of what the reason is.  The only time I think that should be acceptable is if that is the only option.  I don&amp;#8217;t know what the answer is for how for him to move his users over to the new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I kind of like what Mike Jolly did with Download Monitor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	What was &amp;#8212; how did he do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.  So he had an old version of a plugin that he&amp;#8217;d worked on for like three or four years.  And it had a lot of legacy code.  And he rewrote it from the ground up.  The problem is that the new version simply did not work with the existing version.  And so anybody that upgraded, it would just break.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so what he did is he said, okay, I&amp;#8217;m going to re-release this.  It&amp;#8217;s the same plugin, but I&amp;#8217;m going to re-release it in such a way that I don&amp;#8217;t break any existing sites.  Instead, I&amp;#8217;m only going to release it such that new users get the new system.  If somebody wants to migrate from the old one to the new one, they still can because we&amp;#8217;re going to provide them an upgrade method, but it&amp;#8217;s not going to be through the automatic update.  And so what he did is he had version like 4.5 was his current version.  And when he re-released it, he changed his version back to 1.0.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, that&amp;#8217;s smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so this is 1.0 that&amp;#8217;s really 5.0.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But the cool thing that it did is it prevented anybody from auto updating because WordPress will always say, oh, well, this is a lower version, so you can&amp;#8217;t update.  But so it allowed new users to install the brand new plugin that&amp;#8217;s been rewritten from the ground up, but didn&amp;#8217;t break any existing sites unless somebody went in there and manually said, &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s install this.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	So what was his policy with the 4.0 version?  Did he basically say, look, this version is, you know, it&amp;#8217;s going to work, but obviously development is discontinuing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Discontinued, there&amp;#8217;s no support for it, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Wouldn&amp;#8217;t he be overriding?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think that model &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wouldn&amp;#8217;t he be overriding like version 1.0 though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like if someone wanted to go back and get it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, but, I mean, if you think about it, if you have three years of history or two years or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Overriding 1.0, the only problem with it really is for historical sake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, no one is going to go back to install 1.0 when you&amp;#8217;ve gone through 50 versions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And you could still dig it out of version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  And I&amp;#8217;m sure he kept it somewhere.  He probably has it tagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But the point is that he introduced this new version for all new users.  The plugin maintained all of its download stats on WordPress.org, the same URL, the same everything, but he didn&amp;#8217;t break any existing sites via the automatic install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s a good solution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I agree.  I think that was a &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s a nifty workaround for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  We actually &amp;#8212; we had a Skype conversation on how to do it before he did the release because he was worried about the exact same problem because he has half a million downloads on the plugin and was like, I don&amp;#8217;t want to break everybody.  It&amp;#8217;s going to be a nightmare.  And so that was the solution that we came up with for him to do.  And I think it worked well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still a bunch of users that were pissed off because they did.  They&amp;#8217;re like, oh, hey, there&amp;#8217;s a new version.  I&amp;#8217;m going to install it, and didn&amp;#8217;t realize that all of their downloads that they had created would be incompatible and things like that.  But it was still those users that chose to manually install the update.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Huh.  So was there any sort of add-on or anything that migrated, or you were pretty much &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	&amp;#8211; just stuck with &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, he created a legacy migration tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m actually going to test that out on my site sometime soon because I&amp;#8217;ve been using Download Monitor for two years, something like that, and I&amp;#8217;ve got a bunch of downloads in there that I want to migrate.  I just haven&amp;#8217;t done it because it takes time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I think when these problems come up that it really gives you kind of a sense of appreciation, right, for some of the massive plugins like Gravity Forms or, I don&amp;#8217;t know, BackUpBuddy or anything like that that, you know, you know these problems have probably come up, but luckily we just don&amp;#8217;t really ever see them, as an end user.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, and I think if you&amp;#8217;ve done things right, you don&amp;#8217;t see them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, I understand that there are some problems that you have to find a way to get around.  I mean, if you have to change an API, you have to change an API.  But I have never been convinced that the solution that results in thousands of sites breaking is ever the right solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah, I think you&amp;#8217;re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t care what your end goal is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, especially when you&amp;#8217;re taking money from these people of the sites that&amp;#8217;s going to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, I don&amp;#8217;t like to point fingers, but now this is kind of &amp;#8212; in this case we were just talking about Mike and how he handled Download Monitor.  I think my personal opinion is like when WooCommerce 2.0 came out and they broke all the payment gateways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, I think they made a mistake because it broke tons of sites.  Now I understand that they need to introduce that new API because maybe the old one was crappy or it had a limitation.  But the point is that it still resulted in massive breakage.  And for that reason alone, something wasn&amp;#8217;t done the way it probably should have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I agree with that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think WordPress Core is a nice indication of that as well in that, over ten years, there hasn&amp;#8217;t been that massive breakage because of an API change.  And that&amp;#8217;s part of the reason why we have so much legacy code too because backwards compatibility is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward to chatting some more with both of you at WordCamp Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	In like two weeks&amp;#8217; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Gosh, already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s going to be great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot of people there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it&amp;#8217;s May 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The attendance list is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, May 9th to the 11th is when it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, and the attendee list is looking awesome, so I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward to it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Well, it looks like it&amp;#8217;s probably the biggest one of the year, short of San Francisco, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;ll definitely be close to it.  Jared, you&amp;#8217;re speaking there as well, aren&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yes.  I am giving bbPress 1.0 at the BuddyCamp, which is Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, if anybody wants to go learn about BuddyPress, sorry, bbPress and what is &amp;#8212; or BuddyPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Or BuddyPress, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really the bb camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;ll be a great place to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Jared, you&amp;#8217;re obviously well qualified to give that 101 talk, so I&amp;#8217;ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	Yeah, I am.  I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll have too much of a problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Awesome.  Well, Brad, do you want to wrap us up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Well, thanks, everybody.  And catch you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  It&amp;#8217;s been fun.  And thanks, Jared, for coming on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JARED:	No problem.  You all have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Thanks, Jared.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>Joining us for episode 17 is Jared Atchison, a well-known developer in the WordPress development world with an impressive portfolio of work. Along with learning about Jareds day to day work, his recent projects, and what he does on the side, we spend some time discussing WordPress 3.9, the new DemoWP Pro service, bbPress, and how massive plugin upgrades can be handled well or poorly by the developer or team of developers.


This episode was sponsored by WP Ninjas, a leading WordPress plugin development team that is constantly innovating and building excellent tools for the rest of us. Recently they announced their new DemoWP Pro system that allows plugin and theme shops to easily setup live demo environments where potential customers can quickly log in and give the plugin or theme a test drive. In their own words:
Do you sell a WordPress plugin or theme? Do you have a demo site that allows potential customers to try out your product? If you don’t, you’re missing a critical tool for reaching customers. If you do, how did you build it? If you’re like most developers, you had to cobble together snippets of found code, backup services, restriction plugins, and prayer. Hoping that the demo would work like some magically imbued golem. Not only is this method sloppy, hard to manage, and a pain in the butt to update, but it doesn’t even make a good demo. What if two users are editing the same part of your demo at the same time? They might think that your plugin is broken because their changes don’t stick. Cross pollination sucks.

DemoWP PRO offers a new way for customers to try out your products. Every time a user visits your demo site, they are given a fresh, clean sandbox version of your demo. In this quarantined environment, they can test every nook and cranny of your product without ever messing with anyone else’s data. You can decide how long a sandbox gets to live, and once it’s grown up and reached the end of its life, all traces of its existence disappear from your demo. Much like a sad, disenchanted golem.

PIPPIN:	Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 17 of Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Im your host, Pippin Williamson.  Joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Brad Touesnard.

BRAD: 	Hey, everybody.

PIPPIN:	And with us today, we have a special guest, Jared Atchison.

JARED:	Howdy, guys.

PIPPIN:	All right.  So today weve got a few things that we want to talk about, and well jump in.  Primarily were going to let Jared tell us all about himself.  First, we want to give a nice shout out to the WP Ninjas and their new product that theyre working on launching called DemoWP.  It is a system or it is a plugin that allows you to easily set up a demo environment for your plugins or your themes where potential customers can log in and log into the admin and view all the features of your theme or your plugin in a real environment.  

And so its DemoWP.pro.  Go check it out.  Theyre going to be launching here within a couple of days.  Sign up for the newsletter, and keep and eye on it.  I played with it today.  Its really slick.

BRAD:	Yeah, thats awesome.  

JARED:	Im going to have to check that out.

PIPPIN:	Yeah.  If you ever sold a plugin or if youve ever sold a theme, its -- I mean, we get requests for this all the time where people just went, like, hey, can I have a demo of the plugin?  Do you have a live demo I can log into?  And setting that kind of environment up is really ch</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. I&amp;#8217;m your host, Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hi, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: This is Episode 16 and, in this episode, we&amp;#8217;re going to talk a little bit about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on recently and some caching, lots of stuff about caching. So do you want to start us off, Pippin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Why don&amp;#8217;t we start by mentioning our sponsorship for the episode? Sami from Foxnet Themes was kind enough to sponsor an episode. Sami does some really great work over at Foxnet-Themes.fl [sic]. If you just search Foxnet Themes in Google, you&amp;#8217;ll find him. He&amp;#8217;s got some great themes up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also released a nice little blog article recently about his experience becoming a theme author for WordPress.com. WordPress.com tends to have some extra special requirements, things you can or can&amp;#8217;t do, and so he went through some of those requirements really explaining how it wasn&amp;#8217;t that hard to become an author on WordPress.com. So if that&amp;#8217;s something that you&amp;#8217;re interested in, definitely go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. So that&amp;#8217;s Foxnet-Themes.fi, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, fi, sorry. That&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I was like, it&amp;#8217;s fl? When did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I can&amp;#8217;t read. So definitely thanks to Sami for sponsoring the episode and go check him out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep, you&amp;#8217;re awesome, Sami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So, Brad &amp;#8212; Brad, what have you been working on lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So a little while ago I read this article from Theme Foundry about how they sped up their site using Nginx and SPDY and how they got their SSL rating up and stuff. And so it kind of prompted me to upgrade my SSL system. I&amp;#8217;d been using this old server called Pound. It&amp;#8217;s, I think, ancient. And Nginx is far superior. It&amp;#8217;s kind of cutting my teeth on Nginx for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I checked my SSL rating and mine was a C for DeliciousBrains.com, and that was largely because of the configuration of Pound. So I replaced Pound and did some tweaking to the Nginx configuration and managed to get my SSL rating up to A+, so that was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And one of the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s a whole level of the server side of things that I&amp;#8217;ve never even dived into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8212; I find it fun, but some people hate servers. I think Brad Williams is on record: I wish I could run a website without servers, or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have mixed feelings. I love servers in terms of like getting in and understanding how they work and learning how to really fine-tune them and things like that is really awesome. But when it comes to my business or anything like that, I just want my server to run. I don&amp;#8217;t want to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. I think &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s kind of like my mentality with Linux and things like OS X. When I just want to get work done, I just want my laptop to be there, run in OS X to just work. But when I really just want to go have fun and tinker around, I want my Linux box to go do whatever I want on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And if I want to rip the kernel out, I rip the kernel out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think I &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s kind of how I feel about servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve gotten more into performance and like tweaking stuff since I started running an ecommerce website because I&amp;#8217;ve found a fair amount of research that suggests the speed of your website is directly related to your conversion rate. Meaning &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, there are tons of studies that show that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, meaning: if you&amp;#8217;re site is slow, people will buy less. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve kind of taken this to the next level, I guess, but also because I&amp;#8217;m really interested in it. One of the coolest things I found out actually is that there&amp;#8217;s this HTTP header that you can send back in your response. It&amp;#8217;s called the Strict-Transport-Security header. And you just have to send that back, and basically it tells the browser that any future requests to your domain name should be over HTTPS. So the next time you type in HTTP://DeliciousBrains.com, the browser will automatically detect, oh, I got that header last time saying it&amp;#8217;s always HTTP for this domain, and it automatically switches it. So like there&amp;#8217;s no redirect first, which is pretty cool. I had no idea about that until I dove into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I feel like that can have a substantial performance impact in terms of the time it takes to load that initial page &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; just by removing that redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So what have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: My last week or so have been doing a lot of development on Affiliate WP, which is the affiliate plugin I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the last two months or so. I finally got kind of over a hurdle and got to a point where I got the plugin is mostly functioning. I can actually start using it. If I wanted, I could throw in upon a live site and actually start using it. So now it&amp;#8217;s doing a lot of the fine-tuning, the little fun pieces here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently I&amp;#8217;ve been doing two things. Number one, I&amp;#8217;ve been testing it on a whole bunch of different hosting environments. One of the issues that a lot of affiliate plugins have, at least affiliate plugins that are built directly into WordPress, and this also goes for ecommerce plugs as well, is that when you put really aggressive caching in place on your site, which this also leads into our caching discussion here in a little bit, things tend to break and don&amp;#8217;t work as well. So like, you may have a referral link that result in a successful conversion, but, for whatever reason, it doesn&amp;#8217;t actually track the referral or doesn&amp;#8217;t successfully track it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;ve been doing is testing the plugin on all of the different managed WordPress hosts, which generally have more aggressive caching than say your standard shared host or some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What are you using &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What are you using for an endpoint to make that request track that conversion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s all in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I know. But you have a WordPress endpoint too, right, where the JavaScript is hitting some WordPress endpoint to make that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Just admin-ajax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, so you are! That&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; okay, so then that&amp;#8217;s really surprising to me that that would be aggressively cached because those should be off limits, right, those ajax?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, admin-ajax is usually really reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But so what happens is the way that I&amp;#8217;ve set it up is that when you &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217;s say that you load a referral, a URL that has a referral in it. That will actually trigger an ajax request from the JavaScript to admin-ajax at which point that&amp;#8217;s where all of your referral data gets stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so I&amp;#8217;ve been testing that on all the different managed WordPress hosts, as well as some others, because they tend to have things: more aggressive page caching, more aggressive object caching, et cetera. And to make sure that it still works. And so far it&amp;#8217;s working really, really great, which makes me happy. And then the other part of that is building my integrations between Affiliate WP and all of the WordPress ecommerce plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So out of the box, for example, like if you sell through Easy Digital Downloads, it&amp;#8217;ll work for that. It&amp;#8217;ll allow you to track those conversions. If you use WooCommerce, or you use WPCommerce, or use Shopp, JigoShop, or any of the ecommerce plugins, built in all of those integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. Are you having fun with this project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m having lots of fun with it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: My first two months working on it were not very fun because it was kind of just the idea I was going to build it, but I didn&amp;#8217;t really have an architecture in mind. I hadn&amp;#8217;t got to the point where I was starting to really actually see it come together. And, in the last week, I got to where it&amp;#8217;s really actually coming together. It&amp;#8217;s a functioning plugin. It has all these different features. And so now it&amp;#8217;s definitely &amp;#8212; I have to &amp;#8212; a lot of times I have to tell myself not to work on it because I have to do other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. I forgot to mention one thing that I found out recently is that there&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; that you can actually get statistics on your WordPress.org plugin pages from &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve seen that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; from Google Webmaster Tools of all places. So the reason I&amp;#8217;m getting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Isn&amp;#8217;t that tied to the Google+ profile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, so you &amp;#8212; if you add your Google+ profile to your WordPress.org profile, it kind of links the two, and it basically confirms you as an author of those plugins on WordPress.org. And so Google Webmaster Tools then gives you, because you&amp;#8217;ve said I own these pages or I&amp;#8217;m the author of these pages, it then gives you access to how many impressions those pages get, which is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So do you just add the plugin pages like you would add a normal site in Google Webmaster Tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. There&amp;#8217;s a special process. I&amp;#8217;ll link it up in the show notes. There&amp;#8217;s a special process you need to go through to become a verified author of those WordPress.org pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, because I&amp;#8217;ve seen the process for adding them, like adding your Google+ profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I mean like in terms of getting them into Google Webmaster, that&amp;#8217;s the part I&amp;#8217;m not familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, no, no, no. They just showed up. That&amp;#8217;s why I was like what the heck is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, okay. So I&amp;#8217;ve just never gotten my authorship set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Possibly. I mean the authorship should put your headshot next to your plugin pages and search results as well, right? That&amp;#8217;s kind of why I did it initially and because it&amp;#8217;s just cool to claim ownership within the Google search results, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep, clearly I do not have it set up because I do not show up. But I do know what you&amp;#8217;re talking about with the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: There&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Otto wrote up a nice post on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. There&amp;#8217;s a tool that you can kind of submit a certain, you know, submit this page and it&amp;#8217;ll show you if you&amp;#8217;re a verified author on this or not because I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it&amp;#8217;s always going to show a headshot next to your search result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Especially if you&amp;#8217;re the one logged in and searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So, yeah, there are definitely some tools that you can use to get that done. We&amp;#8217;ll link it up in the show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Have you found that those stats show anything useful or interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes, actually, because I &amp;#8212; so I found that my Amazon plugin gets over double the number of impressions than my Migrate DB Pro or Migrate DB, the free version, the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Wow! Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, to be honest, I would have thought Migrate DB would be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So did I. So did I. And I really don&amp;#8217;t know how reliable these stats are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Take them with a grain of salt. But they are still definitely interesting to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah. And I don&amp;#8217;t know where they&amp;#8217;re coming from, to be honest. Is this because WordPress.org has Google analytics stuck into their page, or is this search? Is this from Google search somehow tracking these stats?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I suspected WordPress.org had something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s probably what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: (Indiscernible)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I thought it was just a neat find because I had never seen this thing. To be clear, if you log into Google Webmaster Tools, and you&amp;#8217;ve already verified authorship, there&amp;#8217;s a labs link in the sidebar. And if you expand that, there&amp;#8217;s an author stats link, and that&amp;#8217;s where you find this, this gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ll have to go check that out and see if I can get it set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Have you &amp;#8212; how&amp;#8217;s you’re A/B testing going that we were talking about last time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s going pretty good. I&amp;#8217;m running a test right now based on the size of my checkout screen. So I&amp;#8217;ve seen speculation or maybe proof that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hard to tell with the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve seen various articles that suggest that a skinnier checkout screen converts better than a wide one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Ah, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what I did is I set up an A/B test to take my checkout screen and, for 50% of the users, it gives them the standard width. On a desktop, the EDD checkout screen is like 960 pixels wide, I think. It&amp;#8217;s the same width as the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: As a standard site page. And so then I set up a test so that 50% of people that go to the checkout screen get one that&amp;#8217;s 600 pixels wide, so everything is much smaller. And I wanted to see if that made any difference whatsoever. And I don&amp;#8217;t have enough data to be definitive yet. Simply since the checkout screen is not the most hit page on the site, like it&amp;#8217;s not like the homepage where you can build up thousands of hits in a short period of time. It&amp;#8217;s going to take a little bit longer to accumulate all of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But so far the skinny version has given me a 24.3% improvement on conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s nuts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Isn&amp;#8217;t that crazy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s insane!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Try explaining that one to somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Honestly, I think it comes down, I mean, I like the statement about A/B testing that A/B testing makes the smartest people in the room look like idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because I think it&amp;#8217;s really true. My only explanation is simply that a skinnier screen is to flow down without getting distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. I could see that. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And, I mean, whether there&amp;#8217;s any truth to that or not, I mean, that&amp;#8217;s purely speculation for myself. I have nothing to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So you heard it here, folks. Make all your websites phone width, even on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;d be really interested to know, does &amp;#8212; assuming that this is a standard result that most people would see for checkout screens, does that apply to other parts of a website as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I betcha reading, it does, because I always prefer when it&amp;#8217;s a nice, like, tight column versus &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You don&amp;#8217;t want to read a page that&amp;#8217;s 2,400 pixels wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. You&amp;#8217;re like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You want to read a page that&amp;#8217;s maybe 600 or 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, I think, as you, like when you read one line, it&amp;#8217;s like the sense of accomplishment, like instance sense of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If it takes you, you know, three-quarters of a second to read a line because it&amp;#8217;s like from one &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You also have to take into account like the way that people who read really, really fast do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I didn&amp;#8217;t know this for a long time, but my dad actually showed this to me. He can read a page in like an amazing amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But it turns out it&amp;#8217;s because the way that he reads, he reads with both eyes at once, and he literally just scans down the page. He doesn&amp;#8217;t go left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: He reads an entire line at a time, and he goes down the line. So basically his eyes are focusing on two points of the page just going down the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Whereas most people when they read, read left to right. They&amp;#8217;ll read a line, they move down, the read a line, the move down, et cetera. And so with a skinnier page, it&amp;#8217;s much easier to go straight down without going side-to-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yeah, you don&amp;#8217;t want to be reading one line like that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s why reading on my phone is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah. I really enjoy it as well. It takes some getting used to, but I really enjoy it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I can read an article so much faster on my phone than I can on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I do most of my reading, like I send everything to Instapaper, and I read it on my phone later in the day. That&amp;#8217;s the way I operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Do you use that Instapaper or Readability or one of those things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I never have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nope, never have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, it&amp;#8217;s funny because I always see people, like they&amp;#8217;ll be tweeting about an article that just came out. And I&amp;#8217;m like, I don&amp;#8217;t have time to read that thing yet. It&amp;#8217;s in my Instapaper, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Have you been &amp;#8212; I think you mentioned that you might have been doing some A/B testing as well. What did you find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, yeah! You challenged me last week. You challenged me to a dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s right. Yeah. How did your results come out? Do you have something to share?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, first of all, I went with Google Analytics instead of doing it the easy way. I chose the hardest way possible, which actually just turned out to be &amp;#8212; it actually just turned out to be a lot of reading and sifting through Google&amp;#8217;s docs, which are not very good. And trying to figure out how to &amp;#8212; like what code to add to my site that will pull this off. And, you know, the code in the end was actually very little. And it was kind of nice to be able to write my own JavaScript to change the page according to which test it is, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So I set up &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: (Indiscernible) the variable that you can use in your JavaScript, like this is version A, this is version B?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s actually a little simpler than that. Actually you just drop in this like you set up the experiment in Google Analytics, like you click through. And it gives you this experiment ID. And you drop that in, and then you call a function after you drop that ID in. And this all happens before your Google Analytics code. So you drop this ID in, and it includes this JavaScript. And then you make this call to this choose variation function, and it returns a zero. In my case it&amp;#8217;d be a zero, one, or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that, depending on which one of those, then I change things on the page, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Like as an example, if zero came back, I would change nothing, right? That&amp;#8217;s the original version of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s going to be &amp;#8212; yeah, that&amp;#8217;s going to be your default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And then if one came back, I would remove the links in the header. So if you clicked on the home link, like the icon, nothing would happen. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t go to the homepage. It would do nothing. Then the other links were just completely removed from my navigation bar, so there were gone. And then if a two was returned, I would remove the header completely, so the header bar is gone. And so this is a little bit interesting because it was kind of an A/B/C test, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Were you only doing this on your checkout screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So the idea is, do you, by removing distractions, do you convert better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. That&amp;#8217;s the test that we&amp;#8217;re testing here. And so what was interesting is that so far the removed header completely is actually performing worse, 8% worse actually than the original with &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; with the links. But the one with the removed links and the bar is still there, so the big thing with the bar is that the branding is still there. When the bar is completely gone, I don&amp;#8217;t have any branding anymore, so I think my guess is that it&amp;#8217;s people are losing confidence in the site. It looks almost broken maybe. That&amp;#8217;s my guess. But anyway, removing the links has increased conversion 20%, so that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah! That&amp;#8217;s pretty good, right? So I think I&amp;#8217;ll be doing that going forward is removing those links. I&amp;#8217;m going to keep the experiment running for a little while longer until Google tells me that a winner has been announced because apparently they have some threshold that I have to hit before they actually declare a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty cool. I was pretty happy with the reporting and stuff in Google Analytics, and it was pretty easy to set up once I figured out how to do that. So I might write a blog post just showing people how to do it in Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I would be intrigued to see it. But it sounds like once you have it set up, the actual, the ways that things are added or removed from the page and the way that you&amp;#8217;re looking at results is very similar to what Optimizely does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s exactly the same, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, with Optimizely, you can also write up any custom JavaScript you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Oh, really? I didn&amp;#8217;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, they&amp;#8217;ll give you &amp;#8212; they can give you a panel that basically says write your JavaScript here that you want to run on this variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But then there&amp;#8217;s also more of a visual editor where you can select elements and say just remove this one for me or remove this one. And then I assume they just write some JavaScript for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Huh! That&amp;#8217;s interesting. I also &amp;#8212; I kind of got addicted to this whole thing, this A/B testing. It&amp;#8217;s pretty cool to see these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And so I&amp;#8217;ve actually added another one in the meantime, and I just changed the message on the landing page for Migrate DB Pro to be a bit more engaging, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen a little increase in conversions there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I&amp;#8217;ll be curious to see what happens for you. So like you change that message, and you&amp;#8217;re seeing an increase. I did a similar experiment where I changed the wording of a button and, for the first two weeks, I saw a definite improvement. And then for like four weeks after that, it went straight downhill and it got substantially worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That is so weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which, I mean, I have no explanation for whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I wonder if that is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it just goes to show that you have to accumulate enough data before you make a decision because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; the only thing that can give you a definitive answer is enough data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I think it also &amp;#8212; I think you have to be careful what else is going on. And also, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m testing the right thing here. So right here I&amp;#8217;ve changed. I&amp;#8217;ve changed the wording on the landing page for Migrate DB Pro, and I&amp;#8217;m testing conversions, which is way further down the funnel. Like they have to hit my pricing page and then click a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really should be testing, I think, is if they proceed, like does this affect my bounce rate? Do people stick around the page longer because I&amp;#8217;ve changed this message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. What I did was I looked at engagement, engagement/click. So like did this message encourage the person to click on the button or the button next to it more so than the other message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because it&amp;#8217;s really difficult to say the button on the homepage &amp;#8212; I mean, it depends on where it is. You have to be careful about testing too far down. So just because you have something on the homepage that improved initial engagement does not mean that that&amp;#8217;s going to improve conversation rates. I mean, it might, but that&amp;#8217;s very difficult to test because there are too many variables in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And you also have to be careful like what other things you&amp;#8217;re changing on the site in the meantime, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s why you also have to be careful about running multiple tests at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes. Yeah, that they don&amp;#8217;t conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because they might be conflicting or the message in A over here may be actually affecting the conversion rate of version B over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, I could see that. Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, nuts. It&amp;#8217;s pretty cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Should we get on to the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it is. It&amp;#8217;s fun. Should we get on to the main course here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Let&amp;#8217;s jump into caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: All right. So why do we need to do caching in the first place? Who cares? Let&amp;#8217;s just run our pages right off of the Web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hey, it makes things a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Way easier. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, simply put, caching is for performance. If you get into anything that&amp;#8217;s on a certain scale or complexity, you&amp;#8217;re going to run into performance issues. And one of the ways that we improve that is caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, it obviously goes beyond that, but I think that&amp;#8217;s a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so as an example, so say when you request the homepage, your request goes through and hits the Web server, and the Web server then calls, prepares a query that blows through the database and takes like two seconds to run or something crazy. So then your page doesn&amp;#8217;t come back for like, you know, maybe three or four seconds, which is a really long time in terms of serving a page request, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So there&amp;#8217;s an example where you want to put caching in there somewhere, maybe even like in a couple places, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, because if that page is then cached, depending on how it&amp;#8217;s cached, maybe the first person that visits will generate the page, and then another person will come along and, since the page has been cached in such a way, that visitor never actually touches the database. They don&amp;#8217;t ever do any of those queries or anything. They simply pull the page from cache and it&amp;#8217;s loaded instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s the more or less goal of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, if it was that bad of a scenario that I just describe where it&amp;#8217;s taking two seconds to run an SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You probably have other problems on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You probably want to look at something. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s possible though that that&amp;#8217;s a query that you do want to run now and then. In that case, you might want to run it on a schedule and then cache it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. That&amp;#8217;s where Cron is come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what kind of &amp;#8212; we&amp;#8217;ve got several different kinds of caching. Do you want to walk us through some basic caching types?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, you have a full page cache, so that&amp;#8217;s where the whole page is cached either as a static file on the server or more typically it&amp;#8217;s stored in memory, so the whole page is served up right from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And when you say the whole page, I mean, you mean the text, the images, the HTML, everything that is on that page, every asset, every file, et cetera, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. I just mean the source code of that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s page caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, right, but &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, never mind. Never mind. Yeah, yeah, the source code, the source code of the page. Your assets are not necessarily going to be cached because they may be in an external location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. Yeah. You may, you know, but you could. You could have your CSS and JS and stuff cached as well in memory if you want to serve those up faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, but they are not explicitly going to be included in the page cache unless you have inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly, so that&amp;#8217;s a good way, actually. Like say if you just have a single page for some reason, like a landing page that&amp;#8217;s getting a ton of traffic. If you want to load that page really quickly, maybe you want to dump your CSS right into the page, like right inline. Instead of the page loading and then it having to make a second request to get that CSS, so that&amp;#8217;s another way that you can kind of optimize things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But anyway, another type of caching would be application level or object cache it&amp;#8217;s often called. And that&amp;#8217;s where you store things in memory, so bits of data in memory that is kind of part of the page or part of something that has to do with the page. A typical example of that would be transients in WordPress, right? If you have object caching turned on using &amp;#8212; I think there&amp;#8217;s a few ways that you can turn that on. One is Mark Jaquith&amp;#8217;s APC object cache plugin. Does W3 Total Cache do that as well? I think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes, it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And so, yeah, you can turn that on. And so instead of &amp;#8212; so transients are stored in the database. But instead of WordPress having to go do an SQL query and run it against the database and get that data back and then finally do something with it, it stores it in memory, and so it&amp;#8217;s super fast to access that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The main example, another example would be on transients. But maybe one that people will see on more databases is basically anything in the WordPress Admin, like any of the list tables, whether it&amp;#8217;s post, pages, users, et cetera. If the site has object caching enabled, when those pages are generated, those lists of users, those are coming out of object cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Not the pages, but the data that&amp;#8217;s on the pages. So the list of users, all of the user objects, et cetera are coming out of object cache, assuming they&amp;#8217;ve been cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. And then I guess, well, there&amp;#8217;s actually kind of two &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s actually two kind of variations of object cache as well. There&amp;#8217;s the kind that persists between page requests, and then there&amp;#8217;s the kind that only persists per request. So an example of that would be, that I found out recently, is the get_plugins function. That actually crawls through your WordPress plugins directory, opens up the PHP files and tries to find which ones are actually plugin files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That function actually checks each one of those files. And it stores that in memory for that request. But for future calls to that function, it grabs it from memory. So it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to do all that work again, which is actually a lot of work. So be careful when you&amp;#8217;re calling get_plugins function because if you&amp;#8217;re calling it at every request, it&amp;#8217;s probably not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And what&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s another type. Pippin, do you want to cover that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Database caching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: To be honest, so this is something that this is where my knowledge of caching starts to dwindle a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Database caching is pretty similar to object caching, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You know what, I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of experience with database caching either, to be honest. I just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve always kind of assumed database caching is like caching your queries and anything that you run to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s either &amp;#8212; or it could &amp;#8212; no. Sorry. I know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think MySQL does some fancy stuff on its own like caching common queries, right, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to do so much work for the same query over and over again. I think it kind of handles everything. I&amp;#8217;ve kind of just taken it for granted, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Well, I think you can &amp;#8212; I mean, it&amp;#8217;s very possible that I&amp;#8217;m completely dead wrong on this, so if somebody who is listening knows, that would be awesome to be corrected. But I think the difference between database and object caching &amp;#8212; so object caching is going to cache your query. So that query is never even going to hit the database, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: With database caching, you will hit the database, but you&amp;#8217;re hitting a cached version of the database or of that table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So for example, if we do a user query, and we return ten users, with object caching you&amp;#8217;re going to cache the results of that query. With database caching, you&amp;#8217;re going to cache where those results come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think. My basis for that is simply experience. It has nothing to do with any reading or anything I&amp;#8217;ve ever done. But for example, let&amp;#8217;s say you&amp;#8217;ve got database caching enabled, and you run a query to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then you modify the database, and you run that query again. Your modification may not show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, really? Huh. I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8212; it can be a real pain in the rear for like ecommerce plugins because we&amp;#8217;ll do a query to the database looking for something, I mean whatever it is you&amp;#8217;re looking for. Maybe you&amp;#8217;re trying to confirm a payment, complete an order. And then you run it again, and even though it is actually successful, it didn&amp;#8217;t think it was because it came back with cache data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Huh. Interesting. So what&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; so I think some people might be confused about like the difference between a content delivery network, CDN, and caching because they&amp;#8217;re both often lumped together in terms of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But they are very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Increasing performance, you know, it&amp;#8217;s kind of they&amp;#8217;re all kind of lumped together. Do you want to kind of take us through that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. A CDN is &amp;#8212; okay. Let&amp;#8217;s step back for a second. Let&amp;#8217;s say that you have files on your server, image files, CSS, JavaScript, et cetera. When a page is requested, those files are delivered. They&amp;#8217;re loaded to the Web browser, and they&amp;#8217;re loaded from your server. So the rate at which they can be loaded can be dependent upon your server performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The idea of a CDN, a content delivery network, is taking all of those assets, those resources, and taking them away from your server. So instead of putting the strain on your server and having your &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217;s just, to be extreme, let&amp;#8217;s say instead of having your slow server serve those files to the browser, let&amp;#8217;s have a really fast server serve them instead. So an example that people are probably familiar with, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of reference to say, hey, let&amp;#8217;s have Google deliver jQuery instead of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Instead of our local server because Google is much faster. That&amp;#8217;s exactly what this is. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s simply saying let&amp;#8217;s use Google&amp;#8217;s CDN for this version of this library. A CDN is saying let&amp;#8217;s take all of our images, all of our JavaScript files, all of our CSS, all of these static assets, and let&amp;#8217;s put them onto their servers that are much faster and being used only to deliver these files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. And I guess the other part of it is the delivery network part is really that it can be delivered from a location that&amp;#8217;s close to you. So say you&amp;#8217;re visiting Australia, and you try to load your site there. Well, it&amp;#8217;s going to try; the content delivery network is going to try to serve you assets from its Australian data center to try to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Make things faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And make things faster. But, you know, I&amp;#8217;ve heard various reports about whether that actually works or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s going to be a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If you have a really fast server, a CDN may not do anything for you. If you&amp;#8217;re on a crappy little shared host, a CDN might be your savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It can vary a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think the big thing with CDNs is like if you have rich media files like if you&amp;#8217;re serving MP3s and video files or any big stuff like that, CSNs, I think, are going to save you big time &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; and speed things up for those people that are in Australia or wherever else. So what are the other plugins that or what are some of the plugins for WordPress that can help with caching then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think there are three main ones. There&amp;#8217;s WP Super Cache. There&amp;#8217;s WP Total Cache. And then there&amp;#8217;s APC from Mark Jaquith. The first two are, I&amp;#8217;m going to &amp;#8212; this is not necessarily entirely correct, but they&amp;#8217;re kind of end-user plugins in a way. They&amp;#8217;re plugins that are designed to just be put on your site to give you a performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The APC one from Mark Jaquith is more of a &amp;#8212; I kind of want to say it&amp;#8217;s a developer&amp;#8217;s tool. It&amp;#8217;s not a plugin that you&amp;#8217;re just going to put on your site to improve your performance. It is a plugin that you&amp;#8217;re going to put on your site so that you, as the developer, or other plugins can make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right. So how does &amp;#8212; so what does W3 &amp;#8212; are you familiar with W3 Total Cache?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve used it a lot actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: W3 Total Cache, it does a whole lot of different things. It is a beast to configure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s a kitchen sink plugin, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It is very much a kitchen sink plugin. I mean, it does everything from page caching to object caching and database caching to CDNs to more. And WP Super Cache is much simpler in that it does not have nearly as many options to configure, and it works a little differently. WP Super Cache generates static HTML files of your pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I don&amp;#8217;t think WP Super Cache does anything with database or object caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Now, I mean, we could talk forever on the different things that W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache would allow you to do, and as well as problems that they can raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I want to be very clear from my personal standpoint. I personally don&amp;#8217;t; I really don&amp;#8217;t like cached plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I feel like cache plugins are like patching a hole that should have been repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Kind of. Like caching is server side stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if you are in a position where you have the ability to configure caching on your server, whether that&amp;#8217;s because you&amp;#8217;re on a managed WordPress host, you have your own dedicated server, please do it on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m sure there are people that will disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that a plugin like W3 Total Cache or Super Cache will ever get you the kind of caching that a true server side configuration will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. So the APC plugin from Mark Jaquith, APC Object Cache, it&amp;#8217;s called, that&amp;#8217;s an easy one that you can just drop in to the must-use directory or whatever. I guess you drop it into your content directory, the root of your content directory. And then it becomes a must-use plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And then that supposedly boosts your &amp;#8212; I mean, it uses the object cache that&amp;#8217;s built into PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So WordPress has a built-in API called the WP Object Cache. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with it, I suggest dumping that into Google and go find it on the Codex. And the WP Object Cache is used all throughout WordPress to cache, when able, things like user queries, post queries, things like that. And so the APC Object Cache basically modifies the way that Object Cache stores data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I can&amp;#8217;t say too much more because that&amp;#8217;s kind of where my knowledge with it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, I mean that&amp;#8217;s just, that&amp;#8217;s exactly right. And, I mean, if you don&amp;#8217;t have the Object Cache plugin configured, then you don&amp;#8217;t get that benefit, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: One of the crazy things with the WP Object Cache API, which has some very simple functions to use like, for example, if you do a query, and you want to store those results into the object cache, you can run WP Object Cache like WP_Cache_add or WP_Cache_set, and if your server doesn&amp;#8217;t have cache enabled, it&amp;#8217;ll take it, but it won&amp;#8217;t actually cache it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;ll just ignore it basically, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It totally ignores it. But it is actually &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s kind of cool because it means that, as a developer in your plugins, you can utilize the WP Object Cache as your main method of storing your complex operations into a cache and WordPress will automatically store that into cache in whatever way is available to it or whatever way it&amp;#8217;s been told to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I should clarify. I just said it doesn&amp;#8217;t do anything, but actually it will do things for one request. So within the same request, like I just mentioned about the get &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: The get_plugins call, that uses the WP Object Cache to make sure that it doesn&amp;#8217;t do everything again if get_plugins is called a second time in the same request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. For example, let&amp;#8217;s say in the header of your site you call &amp;#8212; to go off of your same example &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You call get_plugins because you want to list all of the plugins that you run on this site for the public to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It seems silly, but whatever, something like that. And then in the footer, you want to do the same thing. With the WP Object Cache, if you did not have persistent caching enabled, that second time it called get_plugins, it would pull from the cache from that request. But then if you reloaded the page, it would need to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s right. Yep. Yeah, exactly. I guess the other thing we just should probably mention is Varnish, which is like the super trendy page, full-page caching server. For example, I have Varnish running in front of my Apache MySQL on DeliciousBrains.com. I just run Varnish in front of that, and I have it configured to serve stuff right out of the cache, right out of the page cache for most of the URLs, but not things like /myaccount or /checkout, and any request to those pages goes right through to Apache MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that&amp;#8217;s what you were saying earlier, right, Pippin? You prefer that kind of solution over using a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Varnish is crazy too because I&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Varnish is insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ve been hacked or &amp;#8212; hacker newsed, I guess or, you know, listed on the front page of Hacker News this year, and Varnish just doesn&amp;#8217;t even break a sweat. Like it just servers that blog post page like no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Has no problem whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. And that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Varnish is used by a lot of &amp;#8212; I think most or all of the managed WordPress hosts use Varnish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah. They run &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I know WP Engine does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: They don&amp;#8217;t usually run Apache MySQL like I&amp;#8217;m doing, but, you know, I&amp;#8217;m old school and I&amp;#8217;m still learning about Nginx, so I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten that far yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Continuing on with the idea that all of this caching stuff is really server side details, I want to give an example. I feel like I know server side stuff reasonably well. I can set up a server. I could install a box. I could get all my stuff running. For the last three years, I have been the person that maintained and ran and set up a server for a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And this is a company that&amp;#8217;s been very, very successful, and they have a huge, highly traffic site. And I always thought I kind of knew what I was doing with things like setting up all the caching and different options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of server trouble. It was struggling a lot. Once a week or every other week or so, the server would go down because it just got hit too hard. Or it would just be super sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three months ago, the company decided to hire a dedicated server guy part-time that really knew all of this inside and out, and on a server that has fewer resources than anything I ever worked on, he has made the site ten times faster and more reliable simply by knowing how to set up Varnish, how to set up Nginx, how to set up all of those different layers that you will never achieve with something like W3 Total Cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if that&amp;#8217;s something that is important in terms of overall performance, and you really need to do it, investing in the resources, whether it&amp;#8217;s a dedicated server person to do it or whatever. It is amazing. I&amp;#8217;m just in awe of what this guy does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I actually &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I thought I knew what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I have a similar story. Actually, I hired someone off of Odesk to set me up on Amazon EC2 because I didn&amp;#8217;t really know the Amazon stuff like it&amp;#8217;s kind of its own thing, the Amazon way of doing things. And so I didn&amp;#8217;t really know what I was doing there, so I got him to do it. And then I kind of just kind of reverse engineered what he had done to try to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I actually learned a lot that way. So that&amp;#8217;s another way you can do it. Yeah, Odesk is a good place to find sys admins, I guess you would call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Anyways, we should probably &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Pretty crazy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It is crazy stuff. I love it. I love it. I love this stuff. Should we wrap up, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I think I was just going to throw one more thing out. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of stuff that you need to take into account and consideration when you&amp;#8217;re developing plugins that can be impacted by caching. I mean, just for example, ecommerce is huge when it comes to caching like problems with caching plugins and caching systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a lot of different things that you can do, so if you have any questions about, oh, how do I resolve this kind of issue with a caching plugin, or how do I take this scenario into account, let us know. Post questions to the episode. More than happy to help out. It&amp;#8217;s something that we both faced quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ve got a perfect tagline for caching. It&amp;#8217;s damned if you do, damned if you don&amp;#8217;t. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty good. One other small note: Brad and I will both be speaking at WordCamp Miami, which I think has a couple of tickets left. They may have already sold out. But if you want to come by and say hi, WordCamp Miami is an awesome time. It&amp;#8217;s a great place. It&amp;#8217;s one of my favorite WordCamps, and it should be a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward to it. Can&amp;#8217;t wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;ll be great. Cool. Well, thanks, everyone, for listening, and catch you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Im your host, Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.

PIPPIN: Hi, everybody.

BRAD: This is Episode 16 and, in this episode, were going to talk a little bit about what weve been working on recently and some caching, lots of stuff about caching. So do you want to start us off, Pippin?

PIPPIN: Sure. Why dont we start by mentioning our sponsorship for the episode? Sami from Foxnet Themes was kind enough to sponsor an episode. Sami does some really great work over at Foxnet-Themes.fl [sic]. If you just search Foxnet Themes in Google, youll find him. Hes got some great themes up for sale.

He also released a nice little blog article recently about his experience becoming a theme author for WordPress.com. WordPress.com tends to have some extra special requirements, things you can or cant do, and so he went through some of those requirements really explaining how it wasnt that hard to become an author on WordPress.com. So if thats something that youre interested in, definitely go check it out.

BRAD: Cool. So thats Foxnet-Themes.fi, right?

PIPPIN: Oh, fi, sorry. Thats right.

BRAD: Yeah. I was like, its fl? When did that happen?

PIPPIN: I cant read. So definitely thanks to Sami for sponsoring the episode and go check him out.

BRAD: Yep, youre awesome, Sami.

PIPPIN: So, Brad -- Brad, what have you been working on lately?

BRAD: So a little while ago I read this article from Theme Foundry about how they sped up their site using Nginx and SPDY and how they got their SSL rating up and stuff. And so it kind of prompted me to upgrade my SSL system. Id been using this old server called Pound. Its, I think, ancient. And Nginx is far superior. Its kind of cutting my teeth on Nginx for the first time.

Anyway, I checked my SSL rating and mine was a C for DeliciousBrains.com, and that was largely because of the configuration of Pound. So I replaced Pound and did some tweaking to the Nginx configuration and managed to get my SSL rating up to A+, so that was pretty cool.

PIPPIN: That is cool.

BRAD: And one of the --

PIPPIN: Thats a whole level of the server side of things that Ive never even dived into.

BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Its kind of -- I find it fun, but some people hate servers. I think Brad Williams is on record: I wish I could run a website without servers, or something.

PIPPIN: I have mixed feelings. I love servers in terms of like getting in and understanding how they work and learning how to really fine-tune them and things like that is really awesome. But when it comes to my business or anything like that, I just want my server to run. I dont want to touch it.

BRAD: Yeah, exactly. I think --

PIPPIN: Thats kind of like my mentality with Linux and things like OS</itunes:summary>

PIPPIN:	Welcome to Apply Filters, Episode 15.  I&amp;#8217;m Pippin Williamson, your host, along with my cohost, as usual, Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Hey, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Today we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about &amp;#8212; do our usual &amp;#8212; talk a little bit about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on recently, some of our recent projects, and then we want to jump into WordPress 3.9 Beta, which was released a couple of days ago and has a couple of really cool new features, as well as some new developer tools that are pretty slick.  So why don&amp;#8217;t we go ahead and start with Mr. Brad.  Take us away.  Tell us what you&amp;#8217;ve been doing recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Not much.  Just kidding!  Busy as hell, as usual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Again, just kind of refining the renewal process because my renewals are coming up for Migrate DB Pro, and so I was working on an automatic login kind of system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think I remember you mentioning that in a tweet or something somewhere.  Maybe it was in another conversation we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Tell me about that.  I&amp;#8217;m intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  So, well, the email, the renewal emails say, you know, renew now or whatever.  And, I don&amp;#8217;t know, you get these emails for other things that you&amp;#8217;re subscribed to.  And, oftentimes, when you click on them, you have to log in, and then you don&amp;#8217;t have your password because you&amp;#8217;ve forgotten it most likely, unless you&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then you drop out of the renewal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And then you give up or, you know, someone interrupts you, and you forget what you&amp;#8217;re doing or whatever.  So I&amp;#8217;m making this super simple.  If you do a forget-your-password thing anyway, what does it do?  It sends you an email, right?  So there&amp;#8217;s no security problem there if you just allow them to automatically log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right, because you already have access to the email inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly.  Correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s the theory that if a hacker or somebody malicious has access to that, well, they have access to anything they want anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  You better &amp;#8212; I mean, you better have, you know, two-factor authentication set up on gmail, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If you don&amp;#8217;t have that right now, I would suggest you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So this auto login, is it the idea that when they go, when they click on the renewal link, it automatically logs them into their account so they can purchase easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Yep.  And so you&amp;#8217;ll get &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, you&amp;#8217;ll get dropped off right at the checkout and, just a couple clicks later, you can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I would be really interested to know if this is something that you can test.  Do some A/B testing with it where you have, say, half of your users get the non-auto login URL and the other half do, and then look and see what the difference is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  You definitely could.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, obviously it&amp;#8217;s something that you&amp;#8217;re not necessarily &amp;#8212; you don&amp;#8217;t necessarily really want to play with because you know that you&amp;#8217;re probably putting money down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But it would be really fascinating to know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It would be.  But, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m not willing to do that.  It&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you ever decide that your pile of gold is too large and you want to test it, let me know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Usually with A/B tests, you don&amp;#8217;t look at something like, well, let&amp;#8217;s try to make this worse &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; and see if it&amp;#8217;s actually worse.  Usually it&amp;#8217;s like, let&amp;#8217;s try and make this better, but test that it&amp;#8217;s actually better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, no.  I know.  I know.  It still would be a cool, cool stat to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, for sure.  If you didn&amp;#8217;t have a system, an auto log in system, and then you implemented it, that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	See, so that&amp;#8217;s what I have right now because I don&amp;#8217;t have an auto login system.  So for me it would be really useful to go ahead and implement it and then say: Okay.  Here&amp;#8217;s our renewal rate before.  What is it now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And you never know with these things.  There could be something that you could never even imagine.  And for some reason the auto login might be worse.  You know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So that&amp;#8217;s why you do the A/B testing.  Right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Anything else you&amp;#8217;ve been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, so for Migrate DB Pro, we were looking at ways to exclude plugins from loading on certain requests, which sounds crazy, right?  So the way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Walk me through that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So Migrate DB Pro makes ajax requests to accomplish the migration, right?  And so each one of those ajax requests loads like everything for, you know, WordPress Core and all the plugins and your theme, everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right?  Which is a lot of overhead for each request, especially since we&amp;#8217;re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So is the idea to create like a short load process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Kind of.  What we figured out is that we could have a must use plugin in there that basically says we don&amp;#8217;t want to load any &amp;#8212; like have a list of plugins that we don&amp;#8217;t want to load, and it won&amp;#8217;t load them, but only for those requests, only for ajax requests.  So any request to the site or anything like that, all the plugins still load just fine for those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So is that an mu-plugin that when you&amp;#8217;re doing a migration, you have to go in and install the mu-plugin and then any request that you make after that will have those plugins excluded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s right.  Yeah, so what&amp;#8217;s going to happen is, you&amp;#8217;d be able to check off a little option.  And then, when you do that, a little popup will come up saying we want to automatically install this tiny mu-plugin.  And if you say okay, then it&amp;#8217;ll do that.  And cancel, it won&amp;#8217;t do that.  So it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, it&amp;#8217;s asking for permission to do that.  And the plugin will be bundled with Migrate DB Pro and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: 	So it should be &amp;#8212; the reason we have to do an MU is because the plugins are loaded so early on, we have to get ahead of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And you need an mu-plugin to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And the mu-plugins are loaded before normal plugins, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s right, exactly.  So that&amp;#8217;s how you are able to basically say we don&amp;#8217;t want to activate any of these plugins afterwards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  It was an interesting problem to look at and try to solve though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Was the ultimate goal here just to speed up request times because of timeouts on larger sites or just trying to improve performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s one thing.  But we actually started it because there&amp;#8217;s a number of plugins that are repeat offenders that keep getting, causing problems for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right, blocking request or modifying the data in some way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, and other weird things too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Doing other strange things.  Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, so we&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8212; so this is kind of the first step.  The next step will be to maintain a blacklist on our end and basically give them an alert when they have one of those plugins that are problematic and say, &amp;#8220;This is a problem plugin.  You may want to go disable this for any request to Migrate DB Pro.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There are two things I really like about this.  Number one is being proactive and looking at these are support issues that we have that are raised by customers.  What can we do to the code base to help prevent these support issues in the future?  Even though it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily a problem with your code, it&amp;#8217;s saying we&amp;#8217;re going to jump on the gun and account for these issues before they happen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think that&amp;#8217;s really cool and, two, is being aware of how your plugin interacts with other plugins and whether that means you adjust your behavior automatically to account for those, those known plugins, or you just simply tell the customer, &amp;#8220;Hey, we know that there&amp;#8217;s some conflicts here.  This might happen.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I really like both of those attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I mean, there&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; you know, we try our best to, you know, notify the authors when, and try to resolve the issues with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But it&amp;#8217;s not always possible to do that.  And people have old versions of plugins installed and haven&amp;#8217;t updated.  So there&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	We figure we just need another way of doing, tackling this problem.  But anyways, what have you &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, a lot of my usual.  I&amp;#8217;m doing, working on EDD version 2.0 right now, which is coming along.  But I&amp;#8217;ve had two things recently that I&amp;#8217;ve been doing that are kind of outside my normal that I wanted to highlight because they were kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Number one, I recently decided to try and install &amp;#8212; I have a big, multisite install that I manage for a client.  And I decided or they decided they were going to launch another site.  But they want both sites to share the same user database so that they can have the same accounts between both sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And this is something I&amp;#8217;ve known that you can do in WordPress for a long time.  There&amp;#8217;s a constant you can define in the wp-config file to set a custom table to be used as a user table, and a custom table to be used as a user metatable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Can you do this &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And this allows you to have &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Can you do this with non-multisite as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, it works the same way for both.  In my case, I had both installs were going to be multisite installs, which just complicates things a little bit more, but not too much.  The install process is the same.  So it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;d never tried to do, and apparently very, very few people try to do it as well because it turns out that right now you can&amp;#8217;t do it.  It&amp;#8217;s literally impossible because there&amp;#8217;s a bug in WordPress Core that does not let you go through the install process for the second site if you define a custom user table, which was kind of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	But it turns out there&amp;#8217;s a ticket in Trac for it with a patch that works.  And so I spent like an hour trying to figure out why in the world doesn&amp;#8217;t this work?  It seems very straightforward.  And then, sure enough, I look it up, and there&amp;#8217;s a Trac ticket on it, and it&amp;#8217;s getting fixed probably for 3.9 would be my guess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	But anyway, so once I got them installed, it&amp;#8217;s really cool because your user tables are completely synched between the sites, and so you can add a user on one site, and it&amp;#8217;s automatically available on the other site as well.  Each site &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So does it synch.  You just said the two user tables are synched or is it &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	They&amp;#8217;re semi-synched.  Let me clarify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, okay.  So it doesn&amp;#8217;t just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	They&amp;#8217;re semi-synched.  The user &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It doesn&amp;#8217;t just share one table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, it does share one table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So the users themselves, like the user name, their names, their email, their user meta, et cetera, is all synched and is identical, but their user roles are not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So the actual role of your user is set on a per site basis, which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.  Gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So for this one, what we ended up having was two network installs that share the same user base, and then we also have site admins and network admins that may or may not be the same on both sites.  But you can define the role that each user has for each site separately.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So it&amp;#8217;s a shared table, but they&amp;#8217;re still slightly separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So that was fun.  It was just kind of something I&amp;#8217;ve always known that you can do, but I&amp;#8217;ve never actually done it.  And then once I got it up working and it works beautifully, it&amp;#8217;s kind of a fun, little achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The other thing that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on, and this actually goes a little bit into what we were talking about a moment ago is A/B testing.  So I&amp;#8217;ve recently been playing with a service called Optimizely.  It&amp;#8217;s Optimizely.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s amazing!  It&amp;#8217;s absolutely mind-blowing!  What they allow you to do is to set up quick and simple A/B test for pretty much anything.  They have a little JavaScript snippet they give you that you embed on your site.  And then you can go and create an experiment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Let&amp;#8217;s say that I want to A/B test the color of a button on a page or the text of a button.  I can simply go into a visual editor, click on my button and say I want to edit the HTML.  And then you can &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;ll be a variation.  And then you can create another variation if you want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	For me, I ran a test.  I have a download button on the EDD homepage.  And so I wanted to do a quick test that says, okay, which one is better: download, download now, or free download.  And so I created these variations, and then it automatically distributes a version to each user that comes to the site, and then tracks the engagement of the user, the conversion rates, et cetera.  And then it will give you all of the data.  It&amp;#8217;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;ve played with it a little bit, and it is super cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s one of those ones that it&amp;#8217;s almost like unbelievable that it&amp;#8217;s so simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you&amp;#8217;ve ever tried to do A/B testing, and you wanted to try and, like, you thought it was really hard, just go play with Optimizely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  How does it &amp;#8212; do you know how it works?  So it&amp;#8217;s a little JavaScript snippet, so the JavaScript must change your site, like content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It does.  It edits the DOM live.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Before the page is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So when you&amp;#8217;re page &amp;#8212; your page loads like what your site, like your Web server renders it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t think so.  I mean, I guess.  I&amp;#8217;ve never seen it happen though.  Like I&amp;#8217;ve never seen elements change on a page.  So however they&amp;#8217;ve done it, it works really well.  It also works flawlessly, even with super aggressive caching, which is cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Like what do you mean super &amp;#8212; like &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Let&amp;#8217;s say that you have really aggressive page caching, and so you can&amp;#8217;t necessarily modify anything on the PHP level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Or the server side level because it&amp;#8217;s all page cache and it doesn&amp;#8217;t ever hit the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you have that kind of setup, their snippet still works perfectly because that snippet itself is also cached into the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean, if you were going to set up an A/B test yourself just using your own homegrown solution, in that situation with a page cache you&amp;#8217;d have to use JavaScript most likely to show and hide things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  And so that&amp;#8217;s what theirs does.  They use JavaScript to do it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  I was going to try setting it up with Google Analytics because they have like a &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s like an experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve seen theirs.  I never played with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I ran a couple of tests.  I&amp;#8217;ve actually run, I think, five or six now.  Some of them were interesting.  Some of them gave very little insight.  But I did have one that gave a substantial insight that I thought was really cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I&amp;#8217;ve always known, and I think anybody who is in ecommerce at least has a vague idea of this that the simpler your checkout process, typically the higher your conversion rate is.  But it doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily just mean that, like your checkout process in terms of the form that they have to fill out, the customers, needs to be simple, but also means simplifying the environment around the checkout process, so removing distractions from a page.  So I ran a simple test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I want to know, does my checkout form convert better if I remove the navigation from my header.  And it did.  And I ran it over a course of about two weeks.  And so we had several thousand hits to it.  And we saw a 1.4% conversion improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow!  That&amp;#8217;s a huge &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	By removing the header.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That is &amp;#8212; in ecommerce, that is massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	In ecommerce, 1.4% is huge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I ran the numbers to see, like, how much is this worth to me a year, and it was not a small number.  And to think that removing the links from my header improves my conversion rate on average by 1.4%, to me, like, that&amp;#8217;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so it immediately validated all of the ideas around A/B testing, and so now I&amp;#8217;m having fun going &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Do you have numbers for your button change?  I&amp;#8217;m curious what the numbers were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The button change made a really surprising difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I do have those numbers.  Give me a second, and I&amp;#8217;ll actually pull the actual numbers up.  I ran three tests.  The default one that we have right now, it just says download.  And so then I wanted to know what happens if I change it to download now or free download.  We didn&amp;#8217;t change the color.  We didn&amp;#8217;t change the position.  We didn&amp;#8217;t change anything else.  I was really expecting free download to be substantially better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nope.  It was 12.5% worse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And download now was 26.6% worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So the best option there was just download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	The concise &amp;#8212; yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	This was based off of 1,000 visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I thought that was crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Maybe that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s a little bit small, that sample size, but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It is a little small, but I think it&amp;#8217;s large enough to give a pretty good indication of where it was going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It started out, before we got past about like 500, 800 users that had viewed the experiment, the numbers were much closer.  And the bigger, the more visitors that we had, the larger the decrease went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, okay.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It got worse and worse and worse the more visitors we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, so you shut it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So it seemed like it was on a pretty clear trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, right.  Better shut this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s not doing us any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  A/B testing is crazy.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember who said it, but A/B testing makes the smartest people in the room look like idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it&amp;#8217;s totally true.  Oh, here&amp;#8217;s another one that I ran that was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s because the smartest people in the room make logical statements that are often lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And sometimes logic has nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I know!  Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I ran another one that I thought was interesting.  We had a banner on our extensions page, which is kind of like our main store page that says, &amp;#8220;If you purchase three or more extensions, you will get an automatic 10% discount on your order.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I always assumed that it worked really well.  But I wanted to see, okay, does it actually work?  And so I ran an experiment over, I think, two and a half weeks to see.  And this was out of 2,500 unique visitors.  And it turns out that removing the notice actually improved the engagement on the page.  So in other words, it improves the number of people that go and click onto one of the store items by 9% by taking the notice off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What?  What is going on?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah!  It&amp;#8217;s crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It seems so illogical, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It seems so backwards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so this is the kind of thing that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for the last three or four weeks that I&amp;#8217;ve just been playing with, and so I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple that are running right now.  And actually, that three-plus, the extensions notice with the discount is actually still running right now, and so that&amp;#8217;s where we&amp;#8217;re currently at with 2,500 unique visitors and a 10% improvement by removing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So anyway, that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	A/B testing is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I have yet to try it and actually follow through with it and set up some experiments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	My brother had been doing some testing with their sites, and he was just showing me a couple of the experiments that they did, and it was &amp;#8212; seeing a live demo of Optimizely was all I needed to immediately convince me to go purchase a paid account and just set something up immediately.  It takes like ten minutes to set up an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then you just let it run, and it&amp;#8217;s super simple.  And in one case it literally increased yearly revenue by thousands of dollars.  Ten minutes was totally worth it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.  Definitely.  It&amp;#8217;s one of those things that I keep hearing about and people kind of droning on about, about how amazing it is, and I never do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.  Tell you what.  Today or tomorrow, or some time before the end of the week, do the exact same experiment that I did.  Sign up for Optimizely and remove the header or any other distraction that you have on your checkout process and run it for two weeks.  And so the next episode when we come back, I want to know what your improvement is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Damn it, Pippin!  Fine!  I&amp;#8217;m adding it to my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.  Hey, man, you might find out that you literally just increased your revenue by thousands of dollars a year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Damn it, Pippin!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Making my website better and making me more sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, shall we get onto the actual subject for today&amp;#8217;s episode before we run out of time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, let&amp;#8217;s talk about WordPress 3.9.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What&amp;#8217;s exciting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, 3.9 was the beta.  The first beta was released like two days ago, three days ago, something like that.  And if you&amp;#8217;ve been following any of the development for WordPress 3.9, there&amp;#8217;s a bunch of really cool things that are coming.  This is the first beta, so there are still some things that are a little bit rough, but if you play with it, you can get a really good indication of what is going to be in for WordPress 3.9 and some of the cool features.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The first thing that they have on there &amp;#8212; oh, by the way, there&amp;#8217;s two really good posts that you can read to go read about what the new 3.9 features are.  One of them is on WPBeginner, and the other one is at WordPress.org/news.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You just go to WordPress.org.  You can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You don&amp;#8217;t even have to read necessarily.  There are a lot of screenshots in those posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  The WPBeginner one has a lot of screenshots.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really easy to see.  So the first new feature that they&amp;#8217;ve been working on, there&amp;#8217;s been a lot of work with the theme customizer and live preview.  And this is something that it&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8212; I have never really worked with the customizer a lot, but I really like it.  And so they&amp;#8217;ve added the ability to modify, add, remove, rearrange your widgets live.  So if you have a sidebar or any widget area on your site, you can now tweak those via the customizer with a live preview so that you can preview the changes to the widgets before you ever actually apply them, which is really cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It works really well.  The interface is pretty simple and intuitive.  You can easily just go &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I remember when I used to do client work, like the widgets were always a sticky point for customers.  They always had the hardest time trying to figure out where to edit this piece of the site and to track down the widget thing, and then to manage the widgets there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You know, it probably didn&amp;#8217;t help that it used to be a really big thing with themes to have like 20 widget areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which just makes things really complicated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, and it&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8212; you know, it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily that intuitive that you would look for the &amp;#8212; you know, you&amp;#8217;d have to go into the widget thing &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; because most clients were looking at the page.  You know, they&amp;#8217;d go into the page menu and find the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I have something that shows on my about page.  Why isn&amp;#8217;t it on my about page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, totally.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think I&amp;#8217;ve seen plugins that kind of link, that add like a link to the widget.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Or I&amp;#8217;ve seen a couple have &amp;#8212; like create a widget area on your page, and I think it allows you to actually like apply widgets from the page editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I’m not completely confident on that.  I know there are ones that allow you to create widget areas that are specific to certain pages or posts.  But I don&amp;#8217;t remember if they give you an editor on that edit screen as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Anyways, this is a pretty big improvement though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It is, especially if you like working with a theme customizer, which if you&amp;#8217;re a theme developer, honestly I think you should.  I know some people have mixed feelings on it.  Overall, I like it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The next thing that I&amp;#8217;m really excited for, and this is something that we will actually make use of here on the Apply Filters website, is the new ability to have audio and video play list.  So in WordPress 3.7, I think, native audio and video players were added.  So you could just drop an audio file into your post or page, and it would automatically convert it to an audio player.  Well, these have been taken a step further, and you can now have play lists as well, which is pretty cool.  So you can, in the same way that you create a gallery of images, you can now create a gallery of audio files, and it will automatically displayed as a play list, and it will show all the track names and the times and allow you to choose each one you want to play.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s pretty slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That is pretty slick.  I like the improvement to adding sources for audio and video as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If you want to add like a &amp;#8212; so, you know, you upload an .mp3, but you also want to add an Ogg Vorbis audio file, you know, for those people that have a browser with Ogg support natively.  Then you can just upload it through the uploader, and it just kind of automatically adds in the extra source tags, I guess, that it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Which you had to do manually, you know, before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it was still possible, but it &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I used to, when I ran &amp;#8212; I have a tutorial series on plugin development on my website called Plugin Development 101, and they would be videos.  And I used to go and record my video and then convert it into three different formats, and then upload each one of those individual files to the site into a special meta field so that it would display for all browsers.  And it was always a super pain in the ass.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Now I just use Vimeo, which works a million times better anyway.  But the fact that it&amp;#8217;s now native and that you &amp;#8212; pretty cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The other thing is that the UI for creating a play list, whether it&amp;#8217;s audio or video, is now exactly the same as creating a gallery.  So it uses the really nice Backbone editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it&amp;#8217;s just really slick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I like that they&amp;#8217;ve also added subtitle support, which is even crazier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah, that one is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So your video can have subtitles.  I wonder if there&amp;#8217;s a way &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ve been wondering this actually since a while if there&amp;#8217;s a way, like an official way to add our transcripts to the mark up of the audio player so that, you know, web crawlers and stuff come to the site, they kind of know that this is what the audio file says, you know, because like if Google comes along, the Google bot comes along and reads our post, they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily know that the bottom half of our content is what&amp;#8217;s in that audio file.  Right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t see that here.  Maybe if someone out there knows the answer to that, they can add a comment to this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.  On a related note, the tiny MCE, a.k.a. the visual editor for images and other media, has been dramatically improved.  And this one is probably my favorite enhancement to WordPress 3.9.  I&amp;#8217;ve been watching this progress over the last two months or so.  I do all of my development on an SVN repo of WordPress Trunk, so I update it every couple days.  And so, every now and then, I get a: see these in progress features.  And so this one is really slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	You&amp;#8217;re probably familiar with, up until now, if you had inserted an image into a post or into a page, and you want to go edit that image, it&amp;#8217;s a little tedious.  Normally what you would do is you would just click the red cancel button or the delete button, remove the image, go modify the image in an external editor or make any changes, and then reinsert it.  That is so much better in 3.9 now because you can now just click on the image, and it immediately gives you two options.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, it gives you the scaling controls.  So you can just drag an image to make it smaller or larger inside of the actual post editor without ever going to any edit screen.  And then, two, if you click an edit button on the image, it will actually open up the media manager, the new, the Backbone one, and it&amp;#8217;ll give you all of the abilities to edit the caption, the alternate text, change your alignment, change the URL that it&amp;#8217;s linked to, change the size, so like thumbnail, medium, full size, et cetera.  It also gives you a new option &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s really slick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You can also replace the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  That&amp;#8217;s one of my other favorite ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Upload a different image.  Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s kind of neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There used to be a plugin called, I think it was, Replace Image, and it did that same feature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s where this came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It would allow you to actually replace an image.  Well, actually, I think this one is a little bit different.  The Replace Image plugin allowed you to actually replace the media file in the library itself.  So if you had a new version of an attachment, and you wanted to just swap the file out, but you didn&amp;#8217;t want the old one to still be on the server &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; but you wanted to use the same name, that plugin would allow you to do that.  This one, I think it will just replace the image that&amp;#8217;s used in the post content.  It won&amp;#8217;t actually replace the file itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But it&amp;#8217;s still really slick.  And then the other thing that&amp;#8217;s really cool with this is that, so WordPress for a while, since 3.1, 3.2 maybe, has had the ability to actually edit the image files themselves, so crop it, scale it, rotate it, et cetera.  And that all used to be done via the, is it, attachment.php page, I think &amp;#8212; post.php.  And so it&amp;#8217;d be like a post editor, but just for the image.  And now that can all happen in line in the Backbone popup, so you never leave the post edit screen &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; which is really slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Media is getting a lot better in 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think media improvements have been a really consistent improvement over the last five or six WordPress versions.  I mean, ever since they started revamping the media manager with Backbone and getting rid of ThickBox, every major release since then has had a really nice iteration on improving media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  I&amp;#8217;m looking at 3.9 right now, and I&amp;#8217;m seeing formats in my sidebar.  Is that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Formats like post formats?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Where did that come from?  Is that in 3.9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Like the standard post format option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Like standard … image link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, those have always been there.  Those are since like 3.3, 3.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, right, right.  Right, but you have to add support in your theme, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  So you may or may not see them depending on the theme that you have active.  If you&amp;#8217;re looking at like 2012, 2012 has support for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  That must be why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And I was &amp;#8212; yeah, I was thinking of the new UI that they pulled out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I think there&amp;#8217;s a plugin that you can still get that back, can&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There is.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember what it&amp;#8217;s called, but I&amp;#8217;ve seen it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What&amp;#8217;s the other, some other stuff that they&amp;#8217;ve added that&amp;#8217;s new?  I believe you have something coming in 3.9, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Tell us about it.  Those are pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	My first actual contribution to WordPress Core, actually.  It&amp;#8217;s so when you make a call to add image size function, there&amp;#8217;s the third parameter, I believe.  Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.  Yep, the crop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, usually it, or previously it was true or false, and that&amp;#8217;s all you could do.  But now you can actually add how you want it to crop automatically.  So if, for example, it&amp;#8217;s a headshot, you could put in an array that contained top center.  And it would crop the image top and center, and actually show the person&amp;#8217;s head rather than their chest, which was the previous default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	The default before was center-center, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s probably the most typical example of when this is going to be useful.  Before this, I had a bunch of code that I would drop in to make this happen, so it&amp;#8217;s really awesome that now you can just fiddle with that parameter, and that&amp;#8217;s it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really slick.  It&amp;#8217;s definitely one of my favorite enhancements to 3.9 simply out of need and the extra flexibility that it gives.  If you&amp;#8217;ve ever done a client project or any site for your own that&amp;#8217;s featured image heavy or image heavy in any way where you&amp;#8217;re showing some image size in the content, you&amp;#8217;re always going to end up with some image that just doesn&amp;#8217;t quite crop right.  And usually, you&amp;#8217;re right, it&amp;#8217;s like the person&amp;#8217;s head.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Like the top of their head is missing or from the neck up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so this totally took care of that, so I&amp;#8217;m really excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Well, for that situation, you could still use the editor, right, the WordPress Editor to crop the uploaded image &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; to how you wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But it&amp;#8217;s the auto-generated thumbnails that are the big one &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; where this really comes into play.  Think of &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a page on your site, a template that&amp;#8217;s showing thumbnails from all of these different post items, and it&amp;#8217;s just showing the featured image.  Those, while yes you can use the manual crop features to set them exactly how you want, it&amp;#8217;s really tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you just know that all of your images need to start from the top down or the top right or top left, this is going to be huge for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly, and that&amp;#8217;s, yeah, that was the common kind of pushback again implementing this, I think, was that: why do you need this?  Anyone can just crop using the manual crop tool.  But like you just said, if you have got 200 images that all just need to be cropped top center, it&amp;#8217;d be way easier if they just automatically did, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I also really like this as an example, an example that shows how perseverance and keep working towards it pays off in the end.  I mean, this was an enhancement that was proposed two years ago and finally got committed as a fix six days ago.  And so it took two years to get this in even though it&amp;#8217;s only like a 20-line patch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it just goes to show that even if you have an enhancement that seems really straightforward, like if you go back &amp;#8212; I would encourage anybody who is listening to go back and read this ticket, which is 19393.  We&amp;#8217;ll put it in the show notes.  Read this ticket for add image size because it really goes to show how discussions about minor enhancements can go in all sorts of different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because there were a bunch of things that were proposed in this ticket, like one of the reasons why somebody was originally opposed to it was because they were thinking of completely revamping the UI for how images are edited.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so maybe this shouldn&amp;#8217;t be done.  But it did get done, and that made me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  There was &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	[Indiscernible]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There was a lot of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s a major first commit for you, like that&amp;#8217;s awesome.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;m super pumped that it&amp;#8217;s in there.  And, yeah, we don&amp;#8217;t have to deal with like working around the problem anymore, so it&amp;#8217;s great.  But yeah, you&amp;#8217;re right that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of, there was a lot of voices that got added to this that were trying to bring the ticket and add to the scope of it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Which is kind of like attaching extra bills onto a bill to get it through Congress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s not going to happen.  It&amp;#8217;s better if it just remains slim, right, and kind of push it through as it is or don&amp;#8217;t.  And then start new issues for the other things, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, absolutely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, so anyway.  Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	A couple other minor notes on things that are coming in WordPress 3.9 that are kind of cool, number one, the load process for multisite has gotten improved.  I&amp;#8217;m not super familiar with this ticket.  I read through it a couple times.  I think it improves the performance of how the load process works in multisite, which is cool.  The database class is now going to be using the MySQLi database extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, really?  Gees!  I didn&amp;#8217;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.  Yep.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s a big deal.  The ticket on it is huge.  I believe there&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; hold on.  Let me load it up real quick &amp;#8212; tons of voices on it.  Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Gees.  Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s crazy that I didn&amp;#8217;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  There are a lot of voices on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  We actually used to use MySQLi in Migrate DB Pro in the very early versions of it because it supported some stuff that we needed to use.  And then we abandoned it for other ways to do things.  But this is good because it&amp;#8217;s all in the title, right?  It&amp;#8217;s the MySQL improved database extension.  That&amp;#8217;s what the &amp;#8220;i&amp;#8221; stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  That&amp;#8217;ll be cool.  Auto save has gotten some improvements via Heartbeat.  I&amp;#8217;m not too familiar with what those changes are, but supposedly they make a large difference in terms of auto saving the Heartbeat, et cetera.  There have been some library updates.  Primarily, Backbone was updated to 1.1.  Underscores was updated to 1.6.  And Masonry was updated to Masonry 3.  And then it looks like PHPMailer, PLUpload, and TinyMCE all got updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, TinyMCE, that one actually is pretty large for anybody that does anything with TinyMCE because it got updated to version 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is a pretty large update.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, it&amp;#8217;s even noticeable in the UI.  It&amp;#8217;s a little bit nicer, I think, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, a little slicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m not sure what kind of difference it makes for anybody who is using TinyMCE.  There is some discussion in the Trac ticket for people who are using it.  If you are using TinyMCE in your plugins or your themes, you might want to go take a look at it.  I&amp;#8217;ll put a link to it on the show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  You still have time.  We&amp;#8217;re still in beta.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Actually, this is a good point where if you are using it and you have problems, either by 4.0 breaking your stuff or having trouble upgrading it to use the new version or whatever, now would be a great time to jump in on the ticket and put your voice in so that the lead devs are aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because I think 3.9 is scheduled for release in, is it, April or May?  I think it&amp;#8217;s April.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There is an official date set.  I&amp;#8217;m just not sure what it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t know.  The post says next month, so I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, in that case I would say probably April.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Here we go.  Here&amp;#8217;s an actual &amp;#8212; April 15th is 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So you have almost exactly one month to help get things fixed or get your updates in for your plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Anything else that we want to throw in here about 3.9?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	No, I think that&amp;#8217;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think that&amp;#8217;s most of everything that&amp;#8217;s in 3.9.  I mean, obviously there are lots of small things.  There&amp;#8217;s a new &amp;#8212; a couple other related functions for the add image size.  There&amp;#8217;s a has image size and a remove image size now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Did you say you have been contributing to this version a bit yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, 3.9 is the first time that I&amp;#8217;ve &amp;#8212; 3.9 is not my first commit to WordPress Core, but it&amp;#8217;s the first time that I spent a couple of days actively working on Core.  I spent a couple afternoons just working on a bunch of tickets, testing patches, committing some patches, et cetera, and it was really fun.  I think it&amp;#8217;s something that I want to get more into my daily schedule.  Not necessarily my daily schedule, but my weekly schedule.  I think it would be fun to be able to set aside one day of the week to be my WordPress Core day to just help work on tickets, both for giving back, but also because I think it makes me a better developer.  It makes me a better plugin developer by being more in-tune with what&amp;#8217;s going on with WordPress Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And by knowing more of how it works.  And so aside from just giving back, it also contributes to my daily development abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But for 3.9, I think I &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of patches that have been committed, and then there were 10 or 20 tickets that I worked on, either just by leaving a little bit of feedback to testing a patch, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But a really kind of fun bug, actually, that I think is in 3.9, it&amp;#8217;s a really obscure one, but it&amp;#8217;s a little serious.  It turns out, like let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a plugin.  You&amp;#8217;re on a WordPress multisite install.  This is one of the patches that I worked on, so this is how I learned about it.  Say you have a WordPress multisite install, and you activate a plugin on one site of that network.  And then, later on, you decide let&amp;#8217;s go network activate the plugin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It turns out &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	We&amp;#8217;ve been running into this with Migrate DB Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, have you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Maybe I &amp;#8212; hold on.  Maybe I should find you the ticket number then.  Yeah, so if you network activate it, I think that&amp;#8217;s the right way, it turns out that in some specific sequence it is absolutely impossible to then deactivate the plugin after that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because it completely disappears &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; from the subsites.  And so I think there is a patch and it works, and I think it&amp;#8217;s going into 3.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay, cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But it&amp;#8217;s kind of a &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Now I don&amp;#8217;t think that&amp;#8217;s quite what we were running into, but it&amp;#8217;s very &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.  What do you run into?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It wasn&amp;#8217;t a bug in Core.  It was a bug in our plugin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think the problem was that it was showing up in the subsites&amp;#8217; activation lists when it shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It should only ever show up at the network level, so I think that was fixed in the latest release that went out this week, so it&amp;#8217;s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, that&amp;#8217;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Should we wrap things up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think we&amp;#8217;re about at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I just want to mention that if you do subscribe to our podcasts through iTunes, it would be awesome if you could leave a review in iTunes for us.  We currently have goose egg reviews right now &amp;#8212; zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Tell you what: anybody who leaves a review on a podcast, I will go leave a review on your plugin, and I will test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And leave a review [indiscernible].  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So go for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Also, Miami is coming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I believe you are speaking at Miami, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I am.  I was just recently accepted to speak in a couple months in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty exciting.  And you&amp;#8217;ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I will be there, as will a whole bunch of other people.  I think Miami is definitely one of my favorite WordCamps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it&amp;#8217;ll be fun this year.  So if you&amp;#8217;re in the Miami area, or not in the Miami area and you want to travel, it&amp;#8217;s a good one to travel for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And you&amp;#8217;re speaking too, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking on playing nicely with other plugins.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, nice.  I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s, I think, the title of my talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking on &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s a good talk.  I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to that.  I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking on deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So how to avoid ending up with two databases that are very different and then having to merge them together, which is a horrible situation, and just how to avoid that and techniques to avoid that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ll be there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I guess that&amp;#8217;s it for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Thanks, everybody.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	See you in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

PIPPIN:	Welcome to Apply Filters, Episode 15.  Im Pippin Williamson, your host, along with my cohost, as usual, Brad Touesnard.

BRAD:	Hey, everybody.

PIPPIN:	Today were going to talk about -- do our usual -- talk a little bit about what weve been working on recently, some of our recent projects, and then we want to jump into WordPress 3.9 Beta, which was released a couple of days ago and has a couple of really cool new features, as well as some new developer tools that are pretty slick.  So why dont we go ahead and start with Mr. Brad.  Take us away.  Tell us what youve been doing recently.

BRAD:	Not much.  Just kidding!  Busy as hell, as usual.  

PIPPIN:	Yeah?

BRAD:	Yeah.  Again, just kind of refining the renewal process because my renewals are coming up for Migrate DB Pro, and so I was working on an automatic login kind of system.  

PIPPIN:	I think I remember you mentioning that in a tweet or something somewhere.  Maybe it was in another conversation we had.

BRAD:	Yeah.

PIPPIN:	Tell me about that.  Im intrigued.

BRAD:	Yeah.  So, well, the email, the renewal emails say, you know, renew now or whatever.  And, I dont know, you get these emails for other things that youre subscribed to.  And, oftentimes, when you click on them, you have to log in, and then you dont have your password because youve forgotten it most likely, unless youre --

PIPPIN:	And then you drop out of the renewal process.

BRAD:	And then you give up or, you know, someone interrupts you, and you forget what youre doing or whatever.  So Im making this super simple.  If you do a forget-your-password thing anyway, what does it do?  It sends you an email, right?  So theres no security problem there if you just allow them to automatically log in.

PIPPIN:	Right, because you already have access to the email inbox.

BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly.  Correct.

PIPPIN:	Its the theory that if a hacker or somebody malicious has access to that, well, they have access to anything they want anyway.

BRAD:	Yeah.  You better -- I mean, you better have, you know, two-factor authentication set up on gmail, right?  

PIPPIN:	Yeah.

BRAD:	If you dont have that right now, I would suggest you do.

PIPPIN:	So this auto login, is it the idea that when they go, when they click on the renewal link, it automatically logs them into their account so they can purchase easier?

BRAD:	Exactly.  Yep.  And so youll get --

PIPPIN:	Thats pretty cool.

BRAD:	Yeah, youll get dropped off right at the checkout and, just a couple clicks later, you can be done.

PIPPIN:	I would be really interested to know if this is something that you can test.  Do some A/B testing with it where you have, say, half of your users get the non-auto login URL and the other half do, and then look and see what the difference is.  

BRAD:	Yeah.  You definitely could.  

PIPPIN:	I mean, obviously its something that youre not necessarily -- you dont necessarily really want to play with because you know that youre probably puttin</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  I&amp;#8217;m your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	This is Episode 14 and, in this episode, we&amp;#8217;re going to go over a couple of important things to keep in mind when developing for WordPress.  Do you want to get started on that, Pippin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  So we&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of things that we want to cover.  And they&amp;#8217;re really some of the just general tips and practices that you should be keeping in mind when developing.  And these will include things like debug mode, code formatting, and a couple of other things that you may not be quite as familiar with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Before we jump into that though, why don&amp;#8217;t we briefly talk about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on?  Brad, do you want to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, sure.  I was actually testing; a while ago actually, I was testing renewals because the renewals for Migrate WP Pro are coming up, and just testing the system that we had in place.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t working out.  I was trying to fix it, and it still wasn&amp;#8217;t working out.  So just kind of decided to build my own add-on for WooCommerce to handle our renewals and upgrades.  And I just kind of finished that up this week.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  Did you find &amp;#8212; not to get into any nitty-gritty details, but did you just find that the features of the existing system that you were using just weren&amp;#8217;t the right features for you, or did you have some other kind of challenge with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I don&amp;#8217;t think it was quite designed for some of the things that I wanted to do, like certain calculations about like how it handled upgrades.  It wasn&amp;#8217;t sending renewal emails quite how I wanted it to.  You know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I just &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know.  I probably could have got away with it as it was, but I just wasn&amp;#8217;t happy with the way it was doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, and you have the ability to build your own, so why not build something that you&amp;#8217;re going to be completely happy with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And in the end, if you&amp;#8217;re not happy with it, who are you going to blame beside yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I struggled with it quite a bit actually to get it just right, and so I feel pretty good about it right now.  And I feel like this is something that you can&amp;#8217;t really skimp on when you&amp;#8217;re talking about your business.  You know, renewals are super important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.  Renewals are huge.  I mean, if they&amp;#8217;re not something that you&amp;#8217;re considering seriously, then please start now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s right.  Well, what are you working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve had two primary projects over the last week or so.  Both of them are Easy Digital Downloads related.  One of them is, I started to get &amp;#8212; I wanted to get more serious about automatically detecting fraud purchases.  So any time that you&amp;#8217;re dealing with ecommerce, and I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ve run into this as well, fraud can be a very serious issue.  You may have a lot of fraud.  You may have a little bit of fraud.  But basically fraud is a constant.  It&amp;#8217;s going to happen, either from people having stolen credit cards or stolen PayPal accounts or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I wanted to get more serious about preventing it and trying to figure out ways to auto-detect it.  So myself and some of the other EDD development team have been working on an automated fraud detection system specifically for our store.  Later on it might be rolled out to other users as well.  But during the purchase process, it runs some checks and looks for likely indications of fraud.  And if something is detected, it will actually flag that purchase for moderation and let the site admins know that they need to go in and double-check that this purchase is legitimate or if it&amp;#8217;s fraud.  And so that&amp;#8217;s been pretty cool, and it&amp;#8217;s been successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I had a lot of problems with fraud with WP App Store when I was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But since I&amp;#8217;ve moved to using Stripe and PayPal exclusively, I haven&amp;#8217;t had any trouble at all.  So I don&amp;#8217;t know if that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Now when you say you haven&amp;#8217;t had any trouble, I would assume you mean that you haven&amp;#8217;t had problems with lots of fraud.  Everyone is going to have fraud to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right, that&amp;#8217;s right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;ve had one.  It&amp;#8217;s almost been a year since we launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And I&amp;#8217;ve only had one instance of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, and so I thought &amp;#8212; I kind of attribute it to Stripe and PayPal, but maybe &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, Stripe is huge, for sure, especially if you go in and you enable the, like the force it to require the CVV check and the zip code check.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember what the other options are.  Billing address is huge, like making sure that those are all required.  But so, anyway, I was working on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The other thing that we&amp;#8217;re working on was getting a new extension launched for EDD for an integration with Gravity Forms, which is pretty cool.  So we released this new extension called Gravity Forms Checkout that allows you, as a site admin, to create purchase forms for any of your projects.  So then you can embed those purchase forms anywhere on your site.  So instead of like going through the standard EDD checkout process, you would simply fill out the Gravity Form form and that would complete your purchase.  It gives you the ability to use all the awesome Gravity Form&amp;#8217;s conditional tags, calculation fields, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So that would be pretty handy in a scenario where, if you had products that required a bunch of information to be collected with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like if you were ordering, I don&amp;#8217;t know, stationary or letterhead with an address in the letterhead or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And you&amp;#8217;d fill in all those details or maybe add options:  Do you want this to have all these additional options?  Do you want gift-wraps with them?  Do you want envelopes with them?  Do you want all those?  Features like that that you might want to collect is something that this would be very good for, especially then if you need to adjust the final purchase price based on those selections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.  So that launched today.  All right, enough of that.  Shall we jump into our first topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, for sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	This is something that you&amp;#8217;ve been banging away at today, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s not something that I addressed today.  Well, I guess I kind of did.  I tweeted about it this morning, and it actually got quite a bit of attention.  The idea is keeping in mind that the WP Content directory and the uploads directory inside of WP Content are not in fact constants.  They are not always the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this a lot with plugins that I review for WordPress.org.  People forget or simply don&amp;#8217;t know that the WP Content directory is in no way a defined constant.  You can change the name of the WP Content directory to be just &amp;#8220;content&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;data&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;assets&amp;#8221; or anything that you want.  And you can also change the location of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see people will hard code in something like homeURL/WPContent/plugins.  And it will work on a large number of sites, but it will always break on any site that has ever decided to move that folder.  And so that&amp;#8217;s something that you should keep in mind, along with the fact that, along with the WP Content directory being able to be moved or renamed, the actual uploads directory as well, like where all your media files go or any file that you upload from within WordPress, that can also be moved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not even have to live inside of WP Content.  It can live anywhere it wants.  Well, almost anywhere it wants.  It has to be relative to the ABSPATH constant.  So those are things to keep in mind.  Have you ever had to deal with this, Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, I actually do; I set up all my sites with an alternate content directory.  I use Mark Jaquith&amp;#8217;s skeleton, Git repo that he has.  Yeah, just the way &amp;#8212; like he has kind of a default setup of how he sets up his WordPress sites, and I&amp;#8217;ve kind of used a variation of that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	For example, the WP Content directory ends up in /content.  And then WordPress itself, the entire WordPress Core ends up in /WP.  So WordPress Core and the Content directory are at the same level in the directory tree.  I really like it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in testing, it&amp;#8217;s really good because it doesn&amp;#8217;t let me get away with stuff like this.  Right?  If I, you know, make the mistake of using WP Content directory to get the uploads path, for example, in a plugin or something, my environment will not work.  It&amp;#8217;ll just pick the wrong location for the uploads directory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  There are a couple of ways that you can detect these inside of your plugins pretty easily.  First of all, WordPress has a couple of constants that are very useful.  There is a constant called uploads, and that constant is what allows you to define the custom uploads directory.  So if uploads is defined, that will change the directory for the uploads folder.  In your plugin, if you want to know if there&amp;#8217;s a customs uploads directory, you can look to see if that constant is defined.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also the WP_CONTENT_DIR constant, as well as WP_CONTENT_URL constant.  And those are both constants that will refer to wherever the WP Content folder are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	One of them &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Those are the ones that you define in your WP Config if you do want to move your WP Content folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right, but they&amp;#8217;re also defined even if they&amp;#8217;re not defined in the config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I may be wrong, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the uploads constant is only defined if a user defines it.  The WP_CONTENT_DIR and WP_CONTENT_URL are defined no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It just depends on the value of those constants.  So you can use those three constants to figure out where files should go.  Like if you need to determine a custom upload directly like where you are putting a file from a plugin or where you&amp;#8217;re reading files from, things like that.  I believe there are two other systems as well.  Do you want to talk a little bit about those, Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Two other &amp;#8212; sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Two other tools that we can use for detecting the uploads directory or the WP_CONTENT_URL and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;ve always used the wp_upload_dir function.  Yeah, I always just use that, and I forget about the constants, to be honest, because I feel like it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know.  Constants scare me a little bit.  I feel like there could be still something I&amp;#8217;m missing.  There could be still some conditional out there that&amp;#8217;s kind of bypassing the constant and determining the uploads folder some other way or something.  Yeah, I really like the WP Upload directory function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That one is super useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I can&amp;#8217;t remember what it returns.  It&amp;#8217;s an array, I believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s an array of a variety of info.  Give me a second.  I&amp;#8217;ll actually pull it up because I used it pretty recently.  It brings in or, sorry, it returns an array that contains &amp;#8212; well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I don&amp;#8217;t know where the thing is at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Path &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s a bunch of information.  Like, yeah, the paths to &amp;#8212; I think the path, the URL.  Oh, it includes the name of the sub-dir, so let&amp;#8217;s say that you have your files organized in a year and month.  It&amp;#8217;ll tell you what the current one is.  Since this month is February 2014, it&amp;#8217;ll tell you the subdirectory is 2014/02.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Or something like that.  So it allows you to figure out exactly where files should be for this point in time, which can be super handy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The other one, the WP_Filesystem API is super cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;ve never used that, actually, I don&amp;#8217;t think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s an API that I&amp;#8217;ve only played with, I think, one time.  And I will admit it&amp;#8217;s a little scary to play with because, by scary &amp;#8212; sorry.  Scary is not the right word.  Let&amp;#8217;s say intimidating.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	[Laugh] Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you go look at some of the tutorials for the Filesystem API, it can be a little intimidating to look at and to understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, I&amp;#8217;ve totally dug right &amp;#8212; I did a deep dive on this.  I totally know.  I was thinking of something else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But the WP Filesystem, it&amp;#8217;s what WordPress uses, actually, internally for like uploading plugins or deleting plugins or modifying them.  And basically it&amp;#8217;s a really robust way that you can always ensure if WordPress has write access, your plugin can have write access, basically, because any time that a plugin deals with modifying or creating files on the file system, you&amp;#8217;re going to run into permission problems.  And the WP_Filesystem API is probably the most reliable method to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I just want to clarify.  The WP Filesystem doesn&amp;#8217;t actually or it isn&amp;#8217;t used for file uploads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  Your file has to already exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, because when you upload via PHP, it ends up in a temporary directory, and you have to use the PHP function move_uploaded_file, and so the file system is really an abstraction of the file system, and it kind of it&amp;#8217;s a wrapper around the kind of base functions.  But it also abstracts FTP and SSH, allowing you to use those interfaces to manage the file system that way if you don&amp;#8217;t have &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; like basic access.  So say for instance your files, you don&amp;#8217;t have write access to the files, then you can give FTP credentials, and it will actually log in via FTP and operate on the file that way.  So it&amp;#8217;s actually a pretty awesome system, and very unique to WordPress as well because I really haven&amp;#8217;t seen this in other CMSs that I&amp;#8217;ve used.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I haven&amp;#8217;t either.  It&amp;#8217;s definitely a cool system and something that, if you&amp;#8217;re working in the file system, you should take a look at, I think.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I believe you had another note in here that you wanted to include related to a PHP version.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, this is just something we came across.  Ross McKay actually brought it up, and it&amp;#8217;s just this weird bug.  So if you&amp;#8217;re using PHP, less than 5.3.1 on Windows, and you wanted to call the PHP function &amp;#8220;rename&amp;#8221; and actually rename a file between devices, so say you were moving it from D drive to C drive, right?  You actually can&amp;#8217;t do that in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So this is the kind of obscure bugs that you run up against when you&amp;#8217;re developing a product for, you know, rather than if you were just developing one site for one system.  It&amp;#8217;s so much easier, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Shall we move on to our next topic?  Still within the realm of things that you should keep in mind when you&amp;#8217;re writing your plugins or your themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And this one is talking about a minified JavaScript in CSS files.  So you do a lot with migrating files, especially with your new extension.  And I&amp;#8217;m sure that you do a lot with like optimizing your site and such.  So really quickly, would you say that it&amp;#8217;s pretty important for plugin developers and theme developers to ship their code with minified versions of their files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think it is.  I think you need to do that.  And I just want to clarify that my product does not copy CSS or JS files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s true.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Those things should definitely be part of your deployment, your code deployment.  But, yeah, you should definitely ship the minified CSS and JS.  Do you mean like as part of like a plugin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, so let&amp;#8217;s say that your plugin has CSS or JavaScript files that it loads either in the admin or in the front end of your website.  Should you include minified versions of those files that are loaded by the plugin?  So if a user visits your site, and the assets are loaded from your plugin, are they being loaded as a minified version or as the normal version?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  You should definitely have a minified version nowadays, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  I totally agree.  And, honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s a single good argument for why not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	The only argument that I have heard before and that I think is completely valid is it makes it much harder for developers or advanced users to go in and modify those files in any way.  So let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a CSS file and it&amp;#8217;s minified.  And you want to go in, and you want to make some changes to that file.  Well, it&amp;#8217;s really kind of a pain to un-minify a file.  Sure, you can take it and go through a processor that will undo it for you or expand it.  But that&amp;#8217;s a little bit annoying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Why don&amp;#8217;t you just include the source or like the MLS or SAS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That was what I was going to &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s where I was getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think that&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I jumped ahead on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You jumped ahead of me.  It&amp;#8217;s fine.  So I think that&amp;#8217;s the only reasonable answer for why you might not like minified files because they can be more difficult to work with.  Well, WordPress has this really nifty constant that it defines in the WP Config file &amp;#8212; sorry &amp;#8212; that you can define in the WP Config file called SCRIPT_DEBUG.  And WordPress Core actually uses it to load or determine if it should load the minified files or the full sized files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So WordPress Core, by default, loads all minified JavaScript and CSS files.  But if you define SCRIPT_DEBUG to be true in WP Config, it will load the full versions.  And you can use this in your plugins.  There&amp;#8217;s no reason that you can&amp;#8217;t make use of this constant to decide whether your plugin should load a full or minified version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Have you ever done this, Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I have done this, and we do this in Migrate DB Pro.  It checks to see if SCRIPT_DEBUG is on or off, and it adds the .min to the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s a super easy trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  It&amp;#8217;s really &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I mean, it&amp;#8217;s so easy to implement that it&amp;#8217;s kind of one of those, once you realize that you can do this and that you should do that, it&amp;#8217;s kind of a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean, to look at, to find an example of this, you don&amp;#8217;t have to look any further than WordPress Core itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	They do the same thing for their own CSS, so just take a look at that and how they&amp;#8217;re doing it.  Should we talk about &amp;#8212; so when you&amp;#8217;re developing, what are some of the things that you do that you think other people should be doing and there are definitely people that aren&amp;#8217;t doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think there are a couple of things, aside from what we&amp;#8217;ve already mentioned.  Number one is getting really familiar with the other Debug constants that are available.  Most everybody is familiar with WP_DEBUG and hopefully every single developer &amp;#8212; I know this is not actually true &amp;#8212; but hopefully every developer is using it during their development periods of their plugins and their themes to help catch things like notices and warnings and other &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So that&amp;#8217;s the WP_DEBUG constant, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  WP_DEBUG constant.  And it&amp;#8217;s super simple.  If you type &amp;#8220;WP Debug&amp;#8221; into Google, you can find a page on the WordPress codex that talks all about it.  So if it&amp;#8217;s something that you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with, go and become familiar with it.  Not only will it make your code more reliable, it will make you a better developer, and it might reveal a bunch of problems that you didn&amp;#8217;t realize that were there in your code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The most common symptom would be things like notices, so suddenly if you enabled WP_DEBUG, it will spit out a whole bunch of things where it says PHP notice such-and-such variable undefined, or undefined key.  What does it say: undefined key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Something like that.  And so fixing those things is a really good thing to do.  And there&amp;#8217;s another one on there that, Brad, if you want to explain this one called WP_DEBUG display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  Well, you can shut that off, and then it just won&amp;#8217;t show anything on the screen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What&amp;#8217;s that do by default: WP_DEBUG display?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If you have it on by default? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I mean, it&amp;#8217;s on by default if you enable Debug.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I think it is because if you enable Debug, it shows your errors.  If you set Debug display to off, it hides your errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  If you set it to false, Debug, and they don&amp;#8217;t show up, then you have to go digging through your PHP error log, I guess, if you want to see your errors.  Is that how you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Usually.  Right, so Debug display, basically it&amp;#8217;ll make the errors get recorded, but not necessary show them.  So they&amp;#8217;ll show in your error logs.  Another really nifty tool is the Debug Bar plugin.  So if you have WP_DEBUG enabled, and then WP_DEBUG display disabled, it will still allow you to see your errors that you have, but it&amp;#8217;s just going to hide them behind a little menu.  So it&amp;#8217;ll give you a big, red button on your page that says, &amp;#8220;Hey, there&amp;#8217;s errors here.  Reveal them.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;ve also heard of people &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s another constant, WP_DEBUG log, that you can set to true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And that will just put your errors into a file in your WP Content folder, I think.  And so it kind of separates it out from your PHP error log, so you don&amp;#8217;t end up with like other sites in there and stuff.  I think a lot of people do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Personally, I like to have stuff display on the screen because I feel, if things are hidden, it&amp;#8217;s too risky for me.  I might not see them, and it might be too late by the time I do see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s one of the nice &amp;#8212; I totally agree with you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I like it &amp;#8212; I hate that it breaks the display, and I hate that when I have like other plugins that have been developed without WP_DEBUG on, and have notices coming out that it breaks display, but I just don&amp;#8217;t want to take the risk that I&amp;#8217;m going to miss a bug, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.  It&amp;#8217;s one of the things I really liked about the Debug Bar add-on because it will hide the errors from displaying on your page and maybe breaking your layout or breaking options, but it still makes it very, very clear that you have errors on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It adds a big, red button up in the toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;ve used that a little bit.  And then I just keep going back to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; to spitting out &amp;#8212; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The other thing you might want to try is enabling Xdebug, if you haven&amp;#8217;t done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So I just reinstalled MAMP Pro on my machine and, by default, it doesn&amp;#8217;t have Xdebug enabled.  You have to go into MyPHP or php.ini file and uncomment a line at the very bottom.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Here&amp;#8217;s a thing about Xdebug that maybe you know the answer to.  I have not been able to figure it out.  I&amp;#8217;ve never figured out how to enable or disable strict notices.  With Xdebug, have you seen it give a hardcore failure on strict notices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m not sure what you mean: a hardcore failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	For example, if you&amp;#8217;re writing an objected oriented, and you have a class that has a static method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And you call that method non-statically.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	For anyone who is not familiar with that, the syntax to call a static method would be like the class name, colon, colon, the name of the method.  But what people do a lot of times is they&amp;#8217;ll do the name of the class and then your dash greater than [-&gt;] symbol, and then the name of the method, and it works.  But if you have strict Debug enabled, it will actually throw a big, nasty error message at you if you do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which it&amp;#8217;s good because it&amp;#8217;s not technically a valid way to do it.  I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not right.  But what I&amp;#8217;ve never been able to fix out in Xdebug is, I can&amp;#8217;t ever figure out how to turn it on or turn it off.  So on some systems I&amp;#8217;ll have it where Xdebug with strict notices will be on, and it will cause crazy amounts of errors to show up because the vast majority of people don’t have it enabled.  But I&amp;#8217;ve never been able to figure out how to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh.  Strict errors is something that was introduced in PHP 5.4, I believe.  And I think you can disable it just using the error reporting PHP function.  You know how in WordPress Core it makes a call to error reporting, and depending if you have WP_DEBUG set to true or false, you know, it sets the error reporting more aggressively if you have debugging on, obviously.  And I think, like &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t recommend hacking Core, but if you went in there and played around a little bit, I think you could get the strict notices to be disabled.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  I&amp;#8217;m not saying that I necessary want to enable them.  I just want to know how to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, I&amp;#8217;ve been seeing a lot of strict notices as well.  A lot of plugins haven&amp;#8217;t been tested with 5.4, it seems, I think.  But something else people should check out is the Developer plugin.  It&amp;#8217;s a great &amp;#8212; I find it&amp;#8217;s a great place to get started kind of accumulating tools to do your WordPress development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think we touched or we already discussed it though in Episode 5, so people should just check out Episode 5 if they want the details on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, agreed.  Let&amp;#8217;s see anything else that we want to mention about standard things that you should be doing in your development.  I think there&amp;#8217;s a really important one that&amp;#8217;s really important to me at least.  And, Brad, I believe you kind of feel the same way when it comes to coding standards and formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes, yes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Why don&amp;#8217;t you tell us a little bit about how you feel about coding standards and formatting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, I think it&amp;#8217;s super important that you adhere &amp;#8212; so I guess the first thing I always put above everything else is consistency.  So if I start working on someone else&amp;#8217;s code, and they are not, you know, writing things the way I would, I don&amp;#8217;t start changing things or writing things my way, you know, in between what they&amp;#8217;ve written.  I follow whatever standard they seem to be using.  I try to keep it consistent, above all else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	And then, in the future, you know, if we want to reformat the whole thing to adhere to some other standard, then so be it.  But I always prize consistency above everything else.  Is that how you feel, Pippin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.  I think that&amp;#8217;s a good way to put some of the reasons behind the WordPress coding standards.  There&amp;#8217;s a lot of work that&amp;#8217;s been going on recently for enforcing coding standards within the WordPress project.  What that really means is that as WordPress, as a project as a whole has one set of standards that it should follow regardless of who wrote the particular piece of code in the project.  And those coding standards go everything from the way that you space out your code, the way that you align your arguments, the style of brackets that you use, et cetera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	And I think it&amp;#8217;s really important in plugins.  I think it&amp;#8217;s really important in all development.  And I think it&amp;#8217;s something that people dismiss very easily because it&amp;#8217;s not something that is immediately easy to understand or see why it&amp;#8217;s so important.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I think I have a couple of examples.  Number one, have you ever tried; have you ever looked at a plugin or a theme or any piece of code &amp;#8212; it really doesn&amp;#8217;t matter &amp;#8212; that was perfectly formatted?  And by perfectly formatted, I mean like they&amp;#8217;ve gone so far as to align every single variable.  They&amp;#8217;ve got perfect spacing on everything.  And it&amp;#8217;s really easy to read, usually.  This is assuming, of course, that they have other same coding practices.  But it&amp;#8217;s really easy to read and follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Now take that same example, but flip it, and look at one that has really haphazard formatting.  They&amp;#8217;ve got line breaks, either tons and tons of extra line breaks or tons of missing line breaks.  They&amp;#8217;ve got variable names jumbled together.  There&amp;#8217;s no consistency.  And suddenly it&amp;#8217;s very difficult to read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	When it becomes very difficult to read, that also means it&amp;#8217;s much more difficult to debug.  And that’s where I think people fail to realize it.  People think, okay, well, the code works, so why does the formatting matter, because the computer doesn&amp;#8217;t give a crap about the formatting?  But it&amp;#8217;s really important that when you or anyone else has to go back to make an enhancement or a bug fix that you&amp;#8217;re able to actually understand what&amp;#8217;s going on and that you&amp;#8217;re able to do it easily.  Honestly, I think that&amp;#8217;s one of the most important reasons for consistent code formatting and clean formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, yeah, so one of the things, one of the tools that I use to kind of &amp;#8212; so say I encounter a file that I worked on three years ago, and my formatting and coding standards weren&amp;#8217;t very good then.  I&amp;#8217;ll just run it through tidy-php is a package that I have installed into some sublime text, and it just magically formats it according to WordPress&amp;#8217; coding standards.  I mean, it just takes care of everything.  It&amp;#8217;ll put the spacing around your parentheses and all that stuff.  And so you don&amp;#8217;t have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really handy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  You use that as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, super handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think some people also get irritated with formatting because they think they have to do it manually, and it&amp;#8217;s just tedious.  Yes, it can be tedious.  But if you use a tool like this, it&amp;#8217;s literally one keyboard shortcut and you&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So there&amp;#8217;s not really an excuse not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Just make sure when you do these formatting changes that you commit it as one commit without any other changes to the code, and you label the commit &amp;#8220;updating formatting&amp;#8221;, you know, because you don&amp;#8217;t want to mix in a bunch of changes with the formatting changes because formatting changes often change every line of code.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep, yep.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it could become difficult to distinguish what&amp;#8217;s an actual code change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If you realize that you caused a bug there, you&amp;#8217;re going to have a hell of a time tracking that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think there&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8212; go ahead, Brad, and then I have one thing that I want to add before we maybe finish up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I was just going to say that I ran into some code lately that it had comments, like comment stubs on everything, so every function had a comment stub.  And what I mean by stub is that it&amp;#8217;s like the name, the description in the comment was like the name of the function.  Right?  So if the function was send mail, the description read: send mail.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And these were everywhere in the code.  And I was just thinking, &amp;#8220;Wow!  What if there&amp;#8217;s a comment in here somewhere that&amp;#8217;s actually important?  How the heck am I supposed to see it,&amp;#8221; right, because you&amp;#8217;ve just got all these completely redundant comments everywhere?  And so it&amp;#8217;s a needle in the haystack to find what&amp;#8217;s important out of the comments.  So I would say like if you&amp;#8217;re commenting your code, don&amp;#8217;t just comment for the sake of commenting, please.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Comment the why, you know, why this is this way.  You know, that&amp;#8217;s what I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Send to header with a comment: this sends it to the header.  It&amp;#8217;s kind of a like a no-duh statement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So on this note with not necessarily code formatting, but coding standards, so there&amp;#8217;s a little bit of a difference between formatting and standards.  I mean, they go very much hand-in-hand.  But also with standards are things like conventions.  WordPress Core recently decided to add the requirement that any time you have a conditional statement of any kind that you must use curly braces &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; for the opening and the closing.  So what you may or may not be aware of, depending on how fluent you are with PHP, and a lot of other languages as well, that, with a conditional statement, a lot of times what you can do is, you can say like if this equals this, and then the next line is what will happen if that condition is true.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so you don&amp;#8217;t actually have to have the curly braces around it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, WordPress Core recently decided to put in a requirement that says every conditional must use curly braces.  And a lot of people don&amp;#8217;t like it because of the idea that it&amp;#8217;s just extra code for no reason.  Why use four lines when you can use two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, there is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And to be fair, it&amp;#8217;s actually a perfectly legitimate argument, but &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t agree.  There is a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I don&amp;#8217;t necessarily agree that it&amp;#8217;s a good reason to not do it, but I understand the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just like why use more words than are necessary.  But it turns out there&amp;#8217;s actually a very, very good reason to use curly braces.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	[Laugh] Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And, Brad, I think you know where I&amp;#8217;m going with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I think I do.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So if you paid attention to the news recently, there was a really big security update pushed for iOS and also OS X.  And when I say big, I really mean teeny-tiny, like it was one line of code caused this problem.  And it turned out to be a security problem with validating SSL certificates.  And it was a really big deal because it actually provided a really easy way for someone with the right know-how to hack into a system or to take over your laptop, take over your phone, et cetera.  And the bug that caused it was because of a missing curly brace.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer at the time, whoever wrote the code, opted to not use curly braces around their conditional statement, and instead of having one line after the conditional, they had two lines.  And the second line after was getting executed every single time.  And it was basically doing these different checks, and it would have fail statements.  And this extra line resulted in failing every single time, even though it wasn&amp;#8217;t supposed to.  And it caused a giant security problem.  So if they had simply had curly braces around their conditional, it never would have happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.  Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think it was further complicated by the fact that, like, they were both indented, those lines, so &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; easily it looked like, you know &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It looked fine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I remember seeing the code, and it seems fine.  But, yeah, so the moral of the story is like it really does not hurt to have two extra lines of code in your code base, so use curly braces because it will &amp;#8212; aside from preventing glitches like this that are possibly catastrophic, it also just makes it explicitly clear what is and what is not inside of your conditional.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.  I agree with that policy.  And the other thing that it helps with is if someone else comes along and starts adding code, I mean, that&amp;#8217;s probably what happened in the Apple situation.  Someone else came along, and they added that second line of code there.  Right?  It wasn&amp;#8217;t the original developer, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right?  And they just failed to realize, oh, I forgot about the curly braces.  I forgot to add those back in.  But if they had been there in the beginning, right, the problem probably &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It would have never been a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I mean, obviously I&amp;#8217;m just speculating here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But that&amp;#8217;s a plausible situation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, totally plausible.  Yeah.  I firmly believe that coding standards for conventions, formatting, et cetera, are really important, especially when you have a project that dozens or hundreds or thousands of people are working on.  You want to have &amp;#8212; I think your example that you gave a little bit ago is that you want to have consistency.  And so if you take the code that someone else has been working on, and you contribute to it, you want your contributions to match because you want it to be one, coherent project.  And if there&amp;#8217;s no such thing as standards, and you&amp;#8217;re just ignoring them, you end up with a jumbled mess that has the signatures of dozens of people or thousands of people on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;d be kind of like creating a piece of artwork where everybody is responsible for painting one little part in their style.  It&amp;#8217;s probably just not going to work very well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	[Laugh] Exactly.  That sounds like a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Well, do you want to wrap us up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, sure thing.  I guess we should mention our sponsor real quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Ninja Forms is a great forms plugin for WordPress.  Check them out at NinjaForms.com.  And anything else, Pippin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No.  I think that&amp;#8217;s pretty much it.  If anybody has any questions or comments, feel free to leave them on the show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Awesome.  Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Thanks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

BRAD:	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  Im your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson

PIPPIN:	Hello.

BRAD:	This is Episode 14 and, in this episode, were going to go over a couple of important things to keep in mind when developing for WordPress.  Do you want to get started on that, Pippin?

PIPPIN:	Sure.  So weve got a couple of things that we want to cover.  And theyre really some of the just general tips and practices that you should be keeping in mind when developing.  And these will include things like debug mode, code formatting, and a couple of other things that you may not be quite as familiar with.  

	Before we jump into that though, why dont we briefly talk about what weve been working on?  Brad, do you want to start?

BRAD:	Yeah, sure.  I was actually testing; a while ago actually, I was testing renewals because the renewals for Migrate WP Pro are coming up, and just testing the system that we had in place.  It wasnt working out.  I was trying to fix it, and it still wasnt working out.  So just kind of decided to build my own add-on for WooCommerce to handle our renewals and upgrades.  And I just kind of finished that up this week.  

PIPPIN:	Cool.  Did you find -- not to get into any nitty-gritty details, but did you just find that the features of the existing system that you were using just werent the right features for you, or did you have some other kind of challenge with it?

BRAD:	Yeah, I dont think it was quite designed for some of the things that I wanted to do, like certain calculations about like how it handled upgrades.  It wasnt sending renewal emails quite how I wanted it to.  You know?

PIPPIN:	Sure.

BRAD:	I just -- I dont know.  I probably could have got away with it as it was, but I just wasnt happy with the way it was doing things.

PIPPIN:	Well, and you have the ability to build your own, so why not build something that youre going to be completely happy with?

BRAD:	Exactly.

PIPPIN:	And in the end, if youre not happy with it, who are you going to blame beside yourself?

BRAD:	Exactly.  

PIPPIN:	Nice.

BRAD:	Yeah, I struggled with it quite a bit actually to get it just right, and so I feel pretty good about it right now.  And I feel like this is something that you cant really skimp on when youre talking about your business.  You know, renewals are super important.

PIPPIN:	Definitely.  Renewals are huge.  I mean, if theyre not something that youre considering seriously, then please start now.  

BRAD:	Thats right.  Well, what are you working on?

PIPPIN:	Ive had two primary projects over the last week or so.  Both of them are Easy Digital Downloads related.  One of them is, I started to get -- I wanted to get more serious about automatically detecting fraud purchases.  So any time that youre dealing with ecommerce, and Im sure youve run into this as well, fraud can be a very serious issue.  You may have a lot of fraud.  You may have a little bit of fraud.  But basically fraud is a constant.  Its going to happen, either from people hav</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 13 of Apply Filters.  I&amp;#8217;m Pippin Williamson, and with me is my cohost, as usual, Brad Touesnard.  And also joining us, our special guests James Laws and Kevin Stover from Ninja Forms.  Ninja Forms is also our ongoing sponsor, so a huge thank you to them.  Brad, take us away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure thing.  Well, guys, welcome to the show, first of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Well, thank you for having us.  We&amp;#8217;re excited to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  So how about you just start off by just kind of telling us who you guys are and what you guys do kind of on a day-to-day basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Sure.  Well, we have a company called WP Ninjas.  My name is James Laws, and I kind of handle mostly the business side, a little bit of hackery, development, CSS, you know, UI, stuff like that.  But we have a business, WP Ninjas, and we basically build plugins.  I mean that&amp;#8217;s kind of the core of our business.  We do a little bit of client work here and there if a project kind of piques our interest, but mostly we focus on plugin development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	My name is Kevin Stover, and I&amp;#8217;m the lead developer, I guess, here at WP Ninjas.  The main thing that I do is watch over Nina Forms, treat it like a baby and cry when I introduce bugs or when other people introduce bugs, and maintain all of the other people who help commit to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool, awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So what is Ninja forms exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Ninja Forms is a framework for building.  Really, we want to emphasize that, by the way.  I&amp;#8217;ve been in England too long.  That it&amp;#8217;s a framework for building forms in WordPress.  And what we envision it as is any time you need to get user feedback for whatever you&amp;#8217;re doing, then Ninja Forms is a solution for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Great.  So anything from like contact forms to surveys to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; feedback, anything.  Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I would say even application development.  You know, if you&amp;#8217;re building an application and you&amp;#8217;re using kind of WordPress as your core framework for that, but you also need to receive a lot of user input, you know, I think I can see something like real estate sites or any kind of a booking site, or you&amp;#8217;re receiving information that you need to then take and do stuff with.  Ninja Forms works as a great framework and a model for getting all of that data and doing stuff with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.  I&amp;#8217;ve been watching Nina Forms for a while now, and you guys have really come up a lot in, I guess, the plugin world.  I feel like it went from, like a year or two ago, a lot of people knew about Ninja Forms, but your popularity and your user base has just exploded over the last year.  Would you say that&amp;#8217;s probably true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: 	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s from an outside perspective, what I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Well, I appreciate that, and actually hearing the outside perspective is actually really important for us because I think sometimes when you develop a project, you can kind of do so kind of in a bubble.  So you know what you see, and you know what support tickets you&amp;#8217;re getting, and you know who the people are who are reaching out to you.  But sometimes outside of that realm, you have no idea who even knows you exist.  So it&amp;#8217;s always interesting when, you know, you&amp;#8217;re at a WordCamp, or you talk to somebody you know on Twitter and they go, &amp;#8220;Oh, no, I know your product.&amp;#8221;  And you&amp;#8217;re like, &amp;#8220;Oh, that&amp;#8217;s great,&amp;#8221; you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	So I would say yeah.  In the last, especially in the last year, just in 2013, our growth has just been, I think, explosive, although I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot to measure that against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Do you think that&amp;#8217;s just because you guys are putting more and more time into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I think it&amp;#8217;s probably a combination of, you know, it&amp;#8217;s a combination of putting more time into it.  It&amp;#8217;s become our main project, so we&amp;#8217;ve kind of pushed everything else off to the side.  I think it&amp;#8217;s also been probably a combination of other people who have found the plugin and like it and use it.  I would say, you know, just kind of a shout out to you, Pippin.  When you kind of came in, in May, and kind of took a look at it in 2013 and wrote a review and wrote an extension for it, I think that definitely kind of helped as well because a lot of the people in the WordPress community obviously respect you for good reason for your development.  So when you say something is good, I think they&amp;#8217;re like, okay, this thing is good.  So I think that helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If Pippin says jump, I&amp;#8217;ll jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s right.  Exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Brad, jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m sitting down, man.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, stand up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	All right, fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I think those things helped.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah, I think also for me as a developer, it helped a lot to have someone step in and say, &amp;#8220;Hey, you know, this is something that&amp;#8217;s worth looking at,&amp;#8221; so that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.  I know from my own experience building several different plugins that have a little more of a community focus and as opposed to being like my own projects that only I work on, but actively looking for community feedback.  When you start getting that feedback from other users, no matter whether they&amp;#8217;re an advanced developer, a beginning developer, or even just a user, it definitely helps bring not only additional attention, but also helps look at it in a different way.  I remember the first time that somebody told me the way that I&amp;#8217;d done something was terrible, or that it was awesome.  Both of those, both of those outside perspectives help you look at something in a completely different way.  It can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  Definitely so.  Definitely so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think one of the &amp;#8212; when we launched Migrate DB Pro, I felt this, and we started getting feedback through support.  It was like this huge relief because we&amp;#8217;d been working in isolation.  We were making assumptions all the time.  And then to hear people saying you could probably do this better this way or that way, it was like, oh, yeah, totally, we could do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, well, when you&amp;#8217;re working in your own little bubble for months on end, and you&amp;#8217;re the only person or the only team that&amp;#8217;s looking at something, your perspective gets skewed so much.  I mean, whether it&amp;#8217;s in a good way or a bad way.  And it&amp;#8217;s kind of like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Not only that, I find it&amp;#8217;s exhausting to be guessing all the time, guessing what people are going to want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, it&amp;#8217;s huge.  Definitely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  I think there&amp;#8217;s definitely a huge bonus when you have a growing user base and other developers who are developing on and are using it for their own businesses in their development work to kind of come in and either validate or give you different perspectives.  So you don&amp;#8217;t have to, like you said, so you&amp;#8217;re not just kind of guessing and just kind of the exhaustion of, I hope this is what people need and want just because I think it&amp;#8217;s what I need and want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	How long did it take you guys from kind of start to release to get this thing out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	That is a tale that does not fit betwixt the times that we have to tell.  Ninja Forms started life as a project for a client who needed events.  And because James and I were both fairly new to WordPress at that time, we didn&amp;#8217;t think, hey, let&amp;#8217;s go buy Gravity Forms or Formidable, or another, you know, or a form solution because we didn’t know anything.  So we built a solution for the client, and eventually thought, well, hey, what if we released this as a product?  That was Ninja Forms 1.0 eventually, which exists now just in the dark crevices of Ninja Forms as legacy code.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Exists lower than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So you&amp;#8217;re basically saying that Ninja Forms was born out of ignorance.  Is that what you&amp;#8217;re saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes, pretty much.  Yes.  Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Pretty much it was.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	And so then in 2012, I spent all of 2012, my whole life in 2012, besides studying Roman History, was rewriting Ninja Forms from scratch to be extensible and to be modifiable and all the good developing words we like to use to say other people can do things with it.  So that&amp;#8217;s kind of the development cycle.  Then in 2013, we decided to launch 2.0 in 2013 in January, and that&amp;#8217;s kind of where we are now.  Anything you want to add to that, James?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	No, I think that&amp;#8217;s it.  You know, Pippin, you wrote a post just recently, you know, or maybe a while back, I can&amp;#8217;t remember now, about developing plugins that scratch an itch.  That&amp;#8217;s kind of how Ninja Forms came.  We had something.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	You know, the truth is that we knew of other forms plugins, but none of them really had the functionality that we needed for the project that we were working on.  And so instead of, you know, forking them or hacking them or doing some other thing like that, we just kind of built something from scratch.  And it&amp;#8217;s just been a long road of kind of, you know, as we all know, after a very short period of time, you hate your own code.  And so we just kind of rewrote, and we&amp;#8217;re actually rewriting now, so kind of doing a major shift for Ninja Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  It&amp;#8217;s got to happen every now and then because, I mean, you look back and you find all that legacy code and, I mean, legacy might be six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes, absolutely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Has Ninja Forms always been a free plugin in WordPress.org, or was it ever sold as a commercial product before that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	It actually originally started as only a commercial product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	For a massive $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s true.  We launched it.  We sold it on our own website.  We decided to set up some simple PayPal button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Were you about to tell them how much we made from that endeavor for the year, however long it was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Oh, I think, for the entire year, we probably sold, I think, somewhere in the maybe pushing $9,000 for the year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s substantially more than a couple of plugins that I could tell you about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Sure, but it was our only one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	And it was like our main thing and, of course, it was terrible sales, but it was enough to make us think, well, we could sell stuff.  Like we can keep doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It was enough to open your eyes and realize that there was potential of turning it into a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Absolutely.  Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So that&amp;#8217;s about like 60 customers, approximately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, probably pretty close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, well, that&amp;#8217;s a great start.  Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, it kind of started that way.  I think at one point we raised the price to $30 because we thought, you know, maybe on some level, you know, you get what you pay for.  And so we&amp;#8217;re charging $15, and we&amp;#8217;re sure people are looking at that going, that certainly can&amp;#8217;t be worth anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right, and that&amp;#8217;s $15 unlimited sites, unlimited support forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So what made you guys decide to switch from that paid only model to a free model?  As it is now, Ninja Forms has the free plugin available in WordPress.org, and then you have paid extensions.  What made you make the change from the paid only to the freemium model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Well, you know, we went through a lot of transitions to kind of get to where we are now.  We had the original premium and, to be honest, our first reason for changing to a freemium model was all business and promotion.  The idea was, we weren&amp;#8217;t getting a lot of exposure.  It was getting hard to get traffic and get people to find us.  So we thought, you know what?  We&amp;#8217;ll take Ninja Forms Pro, and we will kind of gut it a little bit, and kind of gimp it a little bit, and we&amp;#8217;ll release a lite version of it.  And then that&amp;#8217;ll act as feeder traffic from, you know, WordPress.org to us, and that&amp;#8217;s when we&amp;#8217;ll make all the money.  So it was kind of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	That didn&amp;#8217;t happen either, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, that didn&amp;#8217;t happen.  It was a wrong motivation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You mean it didn&amp;#8217;t happen that you never actually made that switch or didn&amp;#8217;t happen about the change wasn&amp;#8217;t successful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	The change didn&amp;#8217;t work for us.  We did do it.  We had a lite version of Ninja Forms in the repo for probably about seven of eight months of the life of 2012 with Ninja Forms Pro.  And so we had this lite version.  But the reason I think it didn&amp;#8217;t work wasn&amp;#8217;t so much about promotion or product or what the plugin did or didn&amp;#8217;t do.  And this sounds kind of philosophical, but I think it was our motivation in going into it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Our motivation was, you know, hey, this will make us money.  And of course, you run a business, you need to make money.  That&amp;#8217;s fine.  There&amp;#8217;s no shame in wanting to make money.  But that&amp;#8217;s definitely the wrong reason to release a free plugin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	So the shift to where we are now, which is now not just a gimped free plugin with extensions, it&amp;#8217;s a full framework that really does everything a form plugin, for the most part, should do.  And with filters and actions, you can really make it do anything you want with or without extensions.  You don&amp;#8217;t need the extensions.  We wrote the extensions with those action hooks, so anybody could do that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The shift for us was, we really wanted to provide something that the community could use, something that was helpful, whether they paid us money or came to us or needed to work with us or not.  All of a sudden it really did become more of a shift for us as we were developing, saying, man, this would be really useful for the community.  How do we make something that they can use that&amp;#8217;s free, that can become the community forms plugin?  That&amp;#8217;s our real goal is that Ninja Forms would be the forms plugin, the free forms plugin anyway, of the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s great.  I think the point at which when you can recognize that you have achieved that is when you start seeing a lot of themes, primarily commercial themes, adding in support for it, as like the default contact form.  I know for a long &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I think…. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I was going to say, I agree with you.  I think you&amp;#8217;re probably right about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I think, for a long time, the default has always been like Contact Form 7, and so you&amp;#8217;ll go to it, like to go to any theme on ThemeForest, and you&amp;#8217;ll see, oh, this theme has default styling for Contact Form 7.  And then you&amp;#8217;ll see this theme has default styling for Gravity Forms, or Formidable, or Ninja Forms.  And so when you start seeing a huge number of themes providing that default styling, I think you&amp;#8217;ve achieved that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I think you&amp;#8217;re right, and we have some things that we want to do really to work with the themeing community to help them because, you know, there&amp;#8217;s always been this great war, specially among some of like the ThemeForest marketplaces and things like that where there&amp;#8217;s all this functionality built into themes.  And, as plugin developers, we all know that they&amp;#8217;re sometimes the pain of our existence dealing with support because so much functionality just doesn&amp;#8217;t belong in a theme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	And so we want to work with &amp;#8212; we have a plan to try to work with theme developers to give them the ability to have great form functionality with almost not even clicking a button, just by installing their theme with using Ninja Forms.  So we have some stuff we want to work on to kind of help that process along.  I think it&amp;#8217;ll be really great.  But it&amp;#8217;s not even just for us.  It&amp;#8217;s for the theme developers.  It&amp;#8217;s being able to kind of can and have a prepackaged form that&amp;#8217;s specific for your theme already installed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So you guys provide &amp;#8212; so your main business is selling add-ons to the Ninja Forms core.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And you guys provide support, I&amp;#8217;m guessing, for those add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So how big is your support volume, and do you guys have others that are helping you with support, or is it just both of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Right now it&amp;#8217;s pretty much just Kevin and myself handling support.  We probably get somewhere between, you know, 450, 550 tickets a month.  And they range anywhere from they don&amp;#8217;t know where a setting is or, you know, something simple to obviously much more complex theme, conflict, server conflicts, or things like that.  But we handle pretty much all of those.  We probably have about 4,500 users currently on NinjaForms.com in the site, you know, support.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So is that a forum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	We have a support system that we actually built with Ninja Forms.  So it&amp;#8217;s kind of a private ticketing system between developers, either developers of extensions or ourselves and the actual individual.  You know, it sends emails when they submit a ticket.  It sends us a notification by email.  When we respond, it sends them.  We have private replies for moderators to be able to communicate with each other if necessary, things like that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, I see.  So extension developers &amp;#8212; so if I&amp;#8217;d have built an add-on to Ninja Forms, I would be supporting it through the system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	You could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	You certain can, yes.  You know, the way we do it currently is, Kevin and I generally first touch all support tickets.  So if we can avoid bringing in the developer because it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily an issue with their plugin, we try to do that.  But on occasion an issue will come up that&amp;#8217;s actually related to the plugin specifically, and then we can actually assign that ticket to that third party developer, and then they can come right in and chime in on the site right from their dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I built three extensions for Ninja Forms.  I think I have three different ones now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:  	Mm-hmm.  Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And over the life of those, I think you guys have sent me two tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	It&amp;#8217;s true.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I mean, in general, extension developers really don&amp;#8217;t, at least from my experience, don&amp;#8217;t touch on very many support tickets.  I know I got one yesterday.  You guys sent me one.  And then I had one like two weeks ago.  And so far they&amp;#8217;ve all been super minor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  I mean, generally speaking, I think probably your experience is probably the norm for most developers.  Actually, there are some developers who have never ever gotten a ticket from us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So if I wanted to contribute to Ninja Forms, how would I go about doing that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	If you go to GitHub, you can get to GitHub.com/Ninja-Forms, and you can open an issue or look at issues that exist, and you can commit to the develop branch, please, or pull request.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry.  Submit a pull request.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Stuck in SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I&amp;#8217;m stuck in SVN.  I apologize.  GitHub, excuse me.  I&amp;#8217;m stuck in SVN in my brain.  You can submit a pull request on the develop branch of Ninja Forms, and then we can look over it and commit it.  I think we have &amp;#8212; how many people have committed to the core plugin, James?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I want to say probably about 15.  It&amp;#8217;s 15 accepted people who have had pull requests submitted so far, and that&amp;#8217;s something we want to do better.  I mean, we&amp;#8217;ve had a hard time kind of getting other developers probably just in the know more than, you know, getting them interested.  Most people who use Ninja Forms usually get interested fairly quick.  But, you know, getting them involved and showing how they can get involved, we definitely probably have some work we can do there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Interesting.  What about the WordPress.org support forms?  You guys are handling requests there as well?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	We try not to.  We get a few tickets there.  I kind of go in there every once in a while and point them back to our support system.  You know, for a while there, we had probably about seven different plugins that were in the repo, plus some pro versions of those or whatever the case may be.  And it just got too hard to juggle all the different repos and missing email notifications, and so we just kind of consolidated everything into one support system on our site.  And it just makes things a lot easier with the number of requests that we get to kind of handle them.  Occasionally I&amp;#8217;ll kind of go in and just kind of re-point them in the right direction, but we have a sticky post in the forum that kind of points them to our support system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  James has a bugaboo about support forums.  He does not like support forums at all.  As he said, in order to respond to tickets rapidly, we try to put them all in one location because I&amp;#8217;m sure you guys know it&amp;#8217;s really difficult to handle support when you&amp;#8217;re getting it via email and three support forums.  It can get really hairy and hard to deal with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I can understand that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Getting all of that put into one centralized location, whatever that location is, is really important.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And you really kind of have to be a stickler about it with customers that, if they contact you via a non-supported method, just have to tell them, &amp;#8220;Look.  You have to go through here.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	We still get, both for Easy Digital Downloads and some of my other plugins, I still get emails from customers asking for support.  And sometimes I almost feel bad doing it, but I have to tell them, &amp;#8220;Look.  You have to go through the support forums.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry it takes you a little bit longer.  And I&amp;#8217;m sorry that you need an account.&amp;#8221;  But when you get into high-ticket volumes, it&amp;#8217;s really important because it will drown you otherwise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I completely agree with you.  We still get occasionally a support request via email, and I fight back because I keep trying to add new levels to explain to them why they need to be in the support forum.  If you go to Ninja Forms, and you go to our contact us page, and you select general inquiry, which is how some people will send support requests, I finally got it to the point now where it says, you know, sometimes people mistakenly request support through this email form.  We don&amp;#8217;t actually handle support requests through email.  And then I link to the support forum.  And then I have a conditional logic on there that says they have to check the box to explicitly state this is not a support question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I did the same thing where I actually default my contact forms to have the subject be support.  But then I hide the submit button with a big red error message that says, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sorry.  You cannot submit a support ticket through here.&amp;#8221;  So they have to explicitly change it to something other than a support ticket in order to submit a support ticket, and people still do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.  Yeah, and the only reason I made this change is so that I can at least not feel as bad when the email comes in, and I can say, &amp;#8220;You explicitly chose to ignore the fact that we don&amp;#8217;t use this for support.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	&amp;#8220;We can&amp;#8217;t help you here.  Here&amp;#8217;s the link,&amp;#8221; you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Because, you know, the main thing, I don&amp;#8217;t want to be rude to people.  I understand.  I understand the frustration when something doesn&amp;#8217;t work or you have a question, and you just want to find answers.  And we, more than anything, want to make sure that users get the answers that they need.  But for our own sanity, they just have to go through the support system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  I have a similar system with my contact form because people were coming to my website and asking for support through my contact form on my website.  And I clearly had a message that said, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t do WordPress plugin support through here.  Please use the .org forums.&amp;#8221;  And that didn&amp;#8217;t work.  People don&amp;#8217;t read stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	No, they don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That is why I used to only have a message on it.  But then I changed it to be an explicit action that they have to take if they want to try and submit a support ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it definitely did cut down on the volume.  But I am always still surprised when people submit support tickets through there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	On occasion, I&amp;#8217;ll get a ticket where they&amp;#8217;ll say something like, &amp;#8220;Hey, I understand this is not for support, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how to ask this question in a public forum.&amp;#8221;  And I get that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Sure.  Or they weren&amp;#8217;t able to register an account for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Or whatever, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yup, totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	And those things happen.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I think, the action thing, I did the same thing.  I&amp;#8217;ve got like the radio buttons, and you have to choose.  WordPress plugin support is one of them.  And if you choose it, there&amp;#8217;s no forum.  It&amp;#8217;s just information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  It just says, &amp;#8220;Nope.  You can&amp;#8217;t do this.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly, and it&amp;#8217;s worked incredibly well.  I barely get any requests through there.  I think people are just happy to know that you&amp;#8217;ve kind of considered that and pointed them in the right direction.  That&amp;#8217;s all they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.  A lot of times people just don&amp;#8217;t know where the proper channel is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with that.  That might be a failure in your site.  It might just be because they didn&amp;#8217;t look that hard.  It might be they didn&amp;#8217;t even come to your site, and they found you some other means.  There&amp;#8217;s tons of ways that people find to get in touch with you, and you have to do a little bit of handholding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:  	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And that&amp;#8217;s not an offense to anybody who needs that handholding.  It&amp;#8217;s just that&amp;#8217;s how it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Absolutely.  Even on our support page, we kind of set some expectations of what they can expect when they submit a support ticket.  And we simply ask them, &amp;#8220;Do you have an account?  Do you not have an account?  Or do you have an account and can&amp;#8217;t log in for some reason?&amp;#8221;  So we gave them three different channels that they can try to access support to kind of walk them through.  So if they have an account, we send them to the login page, and they&amp;#8217;ll get presented with the support ticket system immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	If they don&amp;#8217;t have an account, we send them to a registration page.  And if they can&amp;#8217;t log in, we send them to our contact form explicitly with &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t log in&amp;#8221; selected, and we ask them some questions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I think, from my perspective as a developer, I&amp;#8217;ve been really happy with the way we&amp;#8217;ve done all those things that James just talked about because he does a lot more of that stuff than I do.  I like the fact that we&amp;#8217;re kind of eating our own dog food, so to speak.  We&amp;#8217;re using our own plugin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Everything on our site that we&amp;#8217;re using to do that with and support forums and registration and log in, all that business is handled by our own plugin.  And I think that has given me anyway, as a developer, it&amp;#8217;s given me a lot of good things to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  The truth is, we could not do business if it weren&amp;#8217;t for two plugins.  Shout out to you, Pippin, Easy Digital Downloads.  We couldn&amp;#8217;t do business without it.  And we couldn&amp;#8217;t do business without Ninja Forms.  Even on our site, we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to handle support or any of the things that we do currently on our site without it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  I use my own systems to power all of my sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And a lot of that is because I know that if I&amp;#8217;m personally using something, I&amp;#8217;m likely to find the flaws or the weaknesses in it, and then attack those and improve them because it&amp;#8217;s scratching my own need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Honestly, that&amp;#8217;s where that blog post of a few weeks ago about writing plugins to scratch an itch came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Because if you write something that you need and you care about and that has a direct impact on what you&amp;#8217;re doing or on your business, you&amp;#8217;re far more likely to maintain it and improve it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, I totally agree.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I really like the proactive way of kind of &amp;#8212; like the stuff that we were just talking about, about contact forms, about being kind of proactive and figuring out the problem before it&amp;#8217;s a problem kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like it&amp;#8217;s intelligently detecting the problem, for instance.  I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys pay attention to SearchWP plugin by Jonathan Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I do.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  He just put out, a couple weeks ago, version 1.8.  And he&amp;#8217;s now detecting theme conflicts, so he&amp;#8217;s like proactively &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: 	I saw that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And so I just wanted &amp;#8212; I thought that was super cool.  I really like to see that kind of like proactive things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was really impressed with that.  James or Kevin, did you guys see that, what he did with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I actually didn&amp;#8217;t see the release.  His is another one of those plugins that I just need to get over there and buy it just to support and probably just to use it because it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s really great.  I&amp;#8217;m using it right now for the documentation search on the EDD site.  I also use it on my Pippins Plugins site.  In general, it just makes your search system better.  But it&amp;#8217;s also great if you want a search system that only searches your documentation or only searches your support forums, things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But, man, his being proactive and he has this notice that says, &amp;#8220;Hey, we detected that your theme is using pre Git post to modify the queries.&amp;#8221;  Well, since SearchWP relies on pre-Git post as the action, it says, &amp;#8220;Look, there might be a conflict here.  Just so that you&amp;#8217;re aware of it if anything breaks.&amp;#8221;  Or you can just ignore because you know that everything is working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right, that is cool.  I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I think that&amp;#8217;s a lot better than just waiting until customers have problems with theme conflicts and then kind of going to Twitter and bitching about it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think this is a better way.  I don&amp;#8217;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s one that I would love to figure out how to solve and be more practice about it for EDD.  We use The Title filter in order to modify product titles and add schema.org markup form.  And every now and then, at least actually a couple times a week, we have issues where somebody, a theme or a plugin is not escaping their titles correctly.  And so all of a sudden we&amp;#8217;ll end up with a bunch of raw HTML just like spewed out on the page near the post title or in the site title.  And it&amp;#8217;s really ugly, and people open tickets about it every week or so.  We&amp;#8217;ve now got two different tutorials and a couple blog posts about it that show how to fix the problem.  There&amp;#8217;s not really anything we can do to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I would love to know, like find a way to detect when a theme is doing it incorrectly so that we can automatically add a notice or automatically disable our schema markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, absolutely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I think, for us, the biggest thing that I would like to be able to detect is when a theme includes an old version of jQuery because that&amp;#8217;s the biggest theme conflict that we run into, especially on the front end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That one you probably could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Themes that include jQuery like 1.2 or, you know, jQuery beta 0.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	1.4.2 is the bane of my existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Actually, I don&amp;#8217;t think that one would be too hard to detect because you could actually look into the global WP-Scripts variable, which will have all of the scripts in there.  And as long as you, say, run a check during WP enqueue scripts, and run it with a really, really high priority, something like 999,009 or something, and then just look through and locate jQuery in the WP-Scripts global, and look at the version number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	One, if you detect that it&amp;#8217;s anything other than what the default in WP Core is, either remove it or just immediately flag a notice that says, &amp;#8220;Hey, if something is breaking, this is probably why.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.  That&amp;#8217;s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You know what would be even better?  Because the other problem is, like, oh, well, they&amp;#8217;re not using the hooks to enqueue the JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right, they&amp;#8217;re not enqueuing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	They&amp;#8217;re not enqueuing it properly.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So do this: use a curl request to get like the source of your rendered page, and then run a reg ex.  Just run a reg ex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s actually not a bad idea at all.  It would work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;d probably work more reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Just strip it out completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, totally, man.  I love it.  That&amp;#8217;s brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I like that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, yeah.  I guess I wouldn&amp;#8217;t use it to strip anything out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No, just use it as a detection &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	As a detection, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; to say oh, look; we found jQuery 1.4.2 in the source of your page.  Now we don&amp;#8217;t know where actually.  Then you could also detect the path of where it came from to identify if it&amp;#8217;s a plugin or a theme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s true.  Cool.  I want to see it the next version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All right.  I want to code snippet written up for this, and I&amp;#8217;m going to take it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I&amp;#8217;ll get right on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Go ahead, Brad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What&amp;#8217;s been the biggest challenges that you guys have kind of encountered with Ninja Forms, like building maybe the core or maybe one of the extensions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Do you want to go first on that, James, or do you want me to, because I think that we&amp;#8217;ll have different challenges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	You know, actually, I was going to kind of segue and hand it over to Kevin, but I think the biggest issue that we&amp;#8217;ve had is, you know, you can never tell how somebody is going to use your plugin and what they&amp;#8217;re going to develop with it.  So when we started with Ninja Forms, and we wanted to add all these options and make it easy for them to set all these options, and I think it ended up biting us a little bit when you get forms that are adding like 500 fields to their form.  And you laugh, but we have lots of users who do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	And they have 500 fields.  I would never even bother filling this form out.  I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re trying to let people file their taxes through Ninja Forms or what they&amp;#8217;re trying to accomplish.  It is insane some of the sizes of forms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve seen that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I worked for a client one time that dealt with a lot of immigration from the U.S. into Canada, and so they had this crazy form that people had to fill out, and it was ten pages worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And the whole form had to be paginated.  And the original, when I took on the project, they sent me the current form, which was like an ask.net page or something and said, all right; we want to put this into WordPress.  And my first instinct was just to groan because it was so huge and insane.  The amount of time it took just to build the fields &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; was ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  I think, for me, the biggest challenge has been becoming comfortable with letting other people into your software, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Becoming comfortable with letting people into your code because this is the first project that I&amp;#8217;ve done that has been a product.  I mean that&amp;#8217;s scary enough.  But also open source so that other people are looking at the code that I write.  And as James said earlier, I&amp;#8217;m very bad about hating my code.  I hate the code I wrote a month ago.  For me, the biggest challenge for me has been becoming okay with the fact that other people are looking at your code and realizing that people aren&amp;#8217;t going to hate you and think that you&amp;#8217;re the worst developer in the world because you did something wrong, or you did something not the best way to do it, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.  I think every developer that moves from, not necessarily true closed source, but open source without actually sharing your code, but somebody who moves from kind of a closed source model to a truly open source model where you are encouraging other people to look at your code.  You are encouraging patches and contributions.  That, the first time you do that is really scary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  I remember the first encounter that I had with that was when James sent a message out on Twitter that said, &amp;#8220;Does anyone want to build a third party extension for Ninja Forms?&amp;#8221;  And you said, &amp;#8220;Yeah, sure.&amp;#8221;  And then we had like a 45-minute Skype conversation.  And I nearly crapped my pants whenever I realized that you were going to be going through lines of code because you were the first person to look at any lines of code.  So that was a little daunting.  I think I&amp;#8217;ve moved beyond that a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  But I think, for me, that&amp;#8217;s the biggest challenge and biggest encouragement I could give to other developers who are thinking about putting their code out there is just to do it, that the WordPress community is pretty good about not yelling at you and calling you names or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I think, too &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	No, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was just going to say, I had Mark Jaquith buy one of my plugins a year ago, and it was like the scariest moment of my life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I can see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I was just waiting for that message on Skype or on GitHub from Mark being like this is crap.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Did you have the instant impulse to like immediately refund his money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	No.  I had the impulse to go run away and close everything down and not connect to the Internet for two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.  Sorry, Pippins Plugins doesn&amp;#8217;t exist anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  I think, for me, that&amp;#8217;s kind of been the biggest challenge.  And we&amp;#8217;re really building a plane in mid flight here because we&amp;#8217;ve gone, and some of our customers have told us that it&amp;#8217;s not the best idea for them.  But we&amp;#8217;ve gone with the iterate often, release often mentality.  And if we find a bug or something that needs to be fixed, we generally do like an update every two weeks or something like that, or more frequently if we have to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	And I think adding features, we try to add features and things like that on a fairly regular basis instead of saving it all up for one big, monster release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There&amp;#8217;s definitely advantages and disadvantages to both models.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Are you still kind of afraid of releases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yes, I&amp;#8217;m very afraid of every release.  Every release, I am afraid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But you get over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Exactly.  I get over it.  Exactly.  Whenever I do a release, I come in to work the next morning and expect James to have like 15 or 20 support tickets for me for something that I&amp;#8217;ve broken.  But no, that&amp;#8217;s gotten a lot better as the product has matured.  One of the challenges, and I&amp;#8217;m sure Pippin can relate to this, is when you have a core plugin and you have extensions, it&amp;#8217;s really easy to break stuff.  It&amp;#8217;s really easy to change something and not know who else is relying on that thing that you changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	And to change something that seems seemingly innocuous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  Suddenly when you have extensions, backwards compatibility gains a whole new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think that&amp;#8217;s why &amp;#8212; I think WooCommerce no longer officially accepts third party extensions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I would not be surprised if that&amp;#8217;s one of the big reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Especially because they&amp;#8217;ve been changing so much of their code base.  I mean, if we look back to their 2.0 release, they had major problems because there were so many gateways that had to be modified.  Now I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about why those changes were put in place, but I&amp;#8217;m assuming for good reasons they made these changes.  And it becomes much harder to make architectural changes to your code base if you have a lot of other people that are building on top of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And it&amp;#8217;s kind of the curse of success, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I kind of like the challenge of making things backwards compatible though.  It&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I enjoy the challenge if you can do it well.  What I hate is when you suddenly find something that you literally cannot backwards &amp;#8212; you can&amp;#8217;t support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Brad, are you a masochist by any chance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t know, man.  I think I&amp;#8217;ve just gotten &amp;#8212; as I&amp;#8217;ve gotten older, I appreciate the challenges more, I guess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	You appreciate old things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I said, you appreciate old things as you get older?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t know.  No, I just appreciate the challenge more.  When I was younger, I was just like, oh, I don&amp;#8217;t really want to stop and have to think about this problem for too long.  I just want to blow through and keep building features and more, more, more.  But now I&amp;#8217;m content to sit and ponder the problem.  It&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Brad, I think I&amp;#8217;m completely with you there.  And I think I went through the same phase where, early on, I really hated the idea of backwards compatibility.  Not backwards compatibility, but I didn&amp;#8217;t like dealing with the problems that you encounter with it.  Now I really like that challenge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.  That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We had an issue in EDD recently where we needed to change an architecture.  I don&amp;#8217;t remember what it was.  I think it was with some payment meta.  And it had the potential of breaking a lot of things for anybody who was using the old method.  And so I took the time to really slowly and carefully think out the different ways that it could be used, and it worked flawlessly.  And it&amp;#8217;s that, the achievement of getting through that challenge successfully is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	No, I can agree with that.  Yeah, I can agree with that.  It&amp;#8217;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean, you&amp;#8217;ve got a draw a line somewhere with the backwards compatibility too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I remember seeing something recently where it was like someone was complaining about they had renamed a file in the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:  	Mm-hmm.  I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And this person was including it, was including the file in their extension or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Directly.  Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so it broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And it broke, and he was upset.  And I&amp;#8217;m like, well, I don&amp;#8217;t know if that&amp;#8217;s the right way to be doing things.  Right?  So you probably are asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s an issue that I fully understand.  As an extension developer, sometimes you want to do things that you just can&amp;#8217;t do without, well, doing some things that are kind of shitty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  But you accept the risks when you do that, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.  And I think that&amp;#8217;s where people who are building on top of other platforms need to acknowledge that risk and need to understand it.  And the people that are building the platforms that are being built on top of need to make sure that that risk is something that they are adequately making clear to anybody who chooses to build on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right.  I think &amp;#8212; go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	I was going to say, yeah.  When you&amp;#8217;re building on a platform or you&amp;#8217;re building a platform that other people can build upon, you have to remember that you are entering into a partnership.  And there has to be some kind of give and take there.  You know, when you put out a release to that core product, you have to also keep in mind all the people that are using it and try to, you know, make sure your communication is clear.  Give a timeline if it&amp;#8217;s a major thing so that everybody can kind of get up to speed because it is; it&amp;#8217;s a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So what&amp;#8217;s next for you guys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	For me, it is working on Ninja Forms 3.0, which will have a completely reworked user interface.  The user interface that Ninja Forms currently has hasn&amp;#8217;t changed since version 1.0 in style.  So the way that the admin for Ninja Forms looks now is the same as it looked in 1.0.  And when we changed to 2.0, we changed kind of the engine of the car, so to speak, so we changed the motor, but we didn&amp;#8217;t change the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	It&amp;#8217;s still in a Pinto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Right, so 3.0 will be a complete rewrite using Backbone so the admin will be completely driven by Backbone.  And third party developers will be able to extend that and be able to use Backbone themselves without having to write the Backbone.  So they can just register settings or options or whatever they want, and then Ninja Forms will handle all of the Backbone saving and that kind of jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	So that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s next for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	We&amp;#8217;re very excited about it.  I&amp;#8217;d say that&amp;#8217;s probably what&amp;#8217;s next for me as well, just kind of pushing this project alone.  We have a lot of new things we want to do.  We want to change the way our fields are being registered to make those a little bit more in line with some of the other things that we&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	And more extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	More extensible.  Pippin, you&amp;#8217;re working on helping a little bit with how we&amp;#8217;re handling submissions and storing the submission data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Trying to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	And I think that&amp;#8217;s going to be a big part of where we&amp;#8217;re headed because once these things are in place, I think we have a lot of room to grow rapidly, especially from an extension standpoint and really just from custom development.  It&amp;#8217;s really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  I think some time later this year we&amp;#8217;d also like to release our support system as a separate paid product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sounds nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;d be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	Yeah.  So at some point later this year we&amp;#8217;re hoping to be able to do that because we&amp;#8217;ve had a lot of people use it, and we&amp;#8217;ve had a lot of people ask what it is and how it works because I think, with some modifications and some additions, it could be a really sweet support system for lots of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, we have to generalize it a little bit.  It&amp;#8217;s very specific to our use case, but I think all the stuff that we&amp;#8217;re doing specifically could be generalized really well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So would that be an add-on for Ninja Forms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	You know, we&amp;#8217;ve gone back and forth.  I think somebody had asked us if we would do it as an add-on.  And I think it&amp;#8217;s moving in the next direction that we see Ninja Forms going, whereas the support system will actually be its own system that will require Ninja Forms to run, but it won&amp;#8217;t necessarily be an add-on.  And the reason for that is, we really see the support system as an application unto itself that uses the framework of Ninja Forms to handle the data that&amp;#8217;s being accepted from users.  And that&amp;#8217;s probably the direction I see of some other products and things that we have, you know, kind of in the wings to be worked on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;ll be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	When can we expect 3.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Yeah, Kevin.  When can we expect 3.0?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	How about tomorrow?  Tomorrow good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	He says, as he holds a knife and looks at me.  We&amp;#8217;re hoping to have it out by WordCamp in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	WordCamp Atlanta.  I&amp;#8217;m sorry.  I forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	There are lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	I forgot that not everyone lives in the southeast of the U.S. like our Canadian friends.  So we&amp;#8217;re hoping by WordCamp Atlanta, which is March the 14th.  Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I thought you were talking about Atlanta Saskatchewan for a minute there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	That&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re hoping.  That&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re shooting for.  I&amp;#8217;ve already &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m at the point now I&amp;#8217;m cutting features because I&amp;#8217;ve already cut lots of features that I didn&amp;#8217;t want to cut, but, you know, you have to &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s survival of the easiest and most likely to be complete instead of survival of the fittest when it comes to releasing.  So we&amp;#8217;re hoping to have it out by then.  That&amp;#8217;s the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Very cool.  Well, I hope you guys succeed with that.  I think we&amp;#8217;ll go ahead and need to wrap up here.  But if anybody has any questions for James or Kevin, how can they get in touch with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	You can definitely get in touch with us on Twitter at @WPNinjas, also myself @JamesLaws and Kevin @KStover.  Or you can just come to NinjaForms.com and fill out our contact form.  Just don&amp;#8217;t use it for support requests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	They will ignore you.  Awesome.  Thanks so much, guys.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And also, just want to give another shout out for sponsoring the show.  We really appreciate your sponsorship.  It helps us do some cool things.  We get to get this episode fully transcribed for anybody who wants to read it as opposed to listening to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES:	We&amp;#8217;re honored to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Thanks so much for your continued sponsorship and for joining us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEVIN:	No.  It&amp;#8217;s no problem.  Thank you, guys.  &lt;/p&gt;

PIPPIN:	Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 13 of Apply Filters.  Im Pippin Williamson, and with me is my cohost, as usual, Brad Touesnard.  And also joining us, our special guests James Laws and Kevin Stover from Ninja Forms.  Ninja Forms is also our ongoing sponsor, so a huge thank you to them.  Brad, take us away.

BRAD:	Sure thing.  Well, guys, welcome to the show, first of all.

JAMES:	Well, thank you for having us.  Were excited to be here.

BRAD:	Yeah.  So how about you just start off by just kind of telling us who you guys are and what you guys do kind of on a day-to-day basis?

JAMES:	Sure.  Well, we have a company called WP Ninjas.  My name is James Laws, and I kind of handle mostly the business side, a little bit of hackery, development, CSS, you know, UI, stuff like that.  But we have a business, WP Ninjas, and we basically build plugins.  I mean thats kind of the core of our business.  We do a little bit of client work here and there if a project kind of piques our interest, but mostly we focus on plugin development.  

KEVIN:	My name is Kevin Stover, and Im the lead developer, I guess, here at WP Ninjas.  The main thing that I do is watch over Nina Forms, treat it like a baby and cry when I introduce bugs or when other people introduce bugs, and maintain all of the other people who help commit to the code.

BRAD:	Cool, awesome.

PIPPIN:	So what is Ninja forms exactly?

KEVIN:	Ninja Forms is a framework for building.  Really, we want to emphasize that, by the way.  Ive been in England too long.  That its a framework for building forms in WordPress.  And what we envision it as is any time you need to get user feedback for whatever youre doing, then Ninja Forms is a solution for that.

BRAD:	Okay, cool.

PIPPIN:	Great.  So anything from like contact forms to surveys to --

KEVIN:	Yeah.

PIPPIN:	-- feedback, anything.  Awesome.

KEVIN:	Yeah. 

JAMES:	I would say even application development.  You know, if youre building an application and youre using kind of WordPress as your core framework for that, but you also need to receive a lot of user input, you know, I think I can see something like real estate sites or any kind of a booking site, or youre receiving information that you need to then take and do stuff with.  Ninja Forms works as a great framework and a model for getting all of that data and doing stuff with it.

BRAD:	Cool.

PIPPIN:	Very cool.  Ive been watching Nina Forms for a while now, and you guys have really come up a lot in, I guess, the plugin world.  I feel like it went from, like a year or two ago, a lot of people knew about Ninja Forms, but your popularity and your user base has just exploded over the last year.  Would you say thats probably true?

JAMES: 	Yeah.

PIPPIN:	Thats from an outside perspective, what I see.

JAMES:	Well, I appreciate that, and actually hearing the outside perspective is actually really important for us because I think sometimes when you develop a project, you can kind of do so kind of in a bubble.  So you know what you see, and you know what support tickets youre getting, and you know who </itunes:summary>

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For episode 12 we decided to tackle the subject of using custom database tables in plugins. Should you use them? Are the postmeta, usermeta, or options tables better? Worse? There are many, many aspects to consider when it comes to structure your plugin&amp;#8217;s data storage. We both have experience with using all of the above methods and use our experience to weigh in on the benefits and disadvantages to using each of them.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;"&gt;BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. I&amp;#8217;m your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost Pippin Williamson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hi, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Today we&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about custom database tables in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: This episode, as well as previous episodes, were once again sponsored by WP Ninjas, the creators of Ninja Forms, which is a great, free plugin for WordPress that allows you to create contact forms, surveys, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little piece of news from them: they recently released a really cool new extension that&amp;#8217;s called Table Editor. So when submitting your forms, if you want the users who are submitting to fill in tabular data, rows and columns of a whole bunch of different data that you may need, whether it&amp;#8217;s T-shirt sizes or user info, anything else that you might need, this extension allows you to do that very easily. So you can check it out at NinjaForms.com. Thank you once again for their sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That sounds really cool. I am going to check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty sweet. It gives you like a spreadsheet view in the form submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Cool! So should we talk about some custom database tables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, but let&amp;#8217;s actually first give a quick mention about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think we kind of skipped over that last time, and there are a few things that might be fun mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so my renewals are coming up soon. My customers are going to be renewing their licenses for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: This is for WP Migrate DB Pro?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That’s right, yeah. And so I just need to do some testing around that and kind of make sure everything is in order, so I&amp;#8217;ve been working on that. What have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool! Outside of Easy Digital Downloads, which, for anybody who is listening is probably familiar, is kind of my main project. My other primary project that I work on is a membership plugin called Restrict Content Pro, and I&amp;#8217;ve been working on getting version 2.0 written up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last six or seven months, the plugin has been not really stagnated, but I&amp;#8217;ve only been doing maintenance releases on it, fixing little bugs here and there, occasional minor features. But now I&amp;#8217;m actively working on version 2.0, which I&amp;#8217;m trying to put a whole bunch of the new features in that have been requested for months, years by a whole bunch of different users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so I&amp;#8217;ve got some of it finished up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Is Chris Coyier using that for his site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s the plugin that runs the lodge at css-tricks.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is fun. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve gotten to work with Chris a couple of times on bugs, feature requests, things like that. His is a great site as an example of like what the plugin is good for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: One of the things I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to put into it, just kind of fun, is the ability to automatically restrict content based on like the category that it&amp;#8217;s in. Right now it works by any time you have a post or a page or custom fields type, you can use a combination of short codes and/or some options out of the Meta Box to restrict that individual post or page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I see, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But a whole bunch of people have wanted to be able to do it automatically based upon the category that something is in. So if you put it in, say, the members category, it&amp;#8217;s automatically restricted, and so that&amp;#8217;s the feature that I&amp;#8217;m working on building right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And so that integrates with EDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It does a little bit of integration with EDD. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s definitely a separate system. The closest integration that we have is, we have one called member discounts for EDD that allows you to give discounts to paid subscribers inside of RCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So why don&amp;#8217;t we go ahead and jump into some discussion custom tables. Take us away with that, Brad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, sure. So I guess the question is, you know, when should you store data in the meta table, so post meta or user meta, or all these meta tables, which are just really key value stores. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: When should you use those, and when should you not use those? When should you create a custom table that has your own field types and, you know, completely custom table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I actually wrote a blog post about this a while ago because I ran into issues just using custom fields with a WordPress site I was working on, and I decided to try custom tables, and it worked out really well. So I kind of just shared that with people on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What was the premise of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it was &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You want to store like post meta type stuff inside of a custom table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Were you trying to store like custom fields as in post meta, but stored in a custom table instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so I was working on WP App Store, so I was basically doing ecommerce kind of stuff, and so I was having a hard time storing an order, like the order information, like the order details as post meta because I found the queries were getting really complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: They were getting, like especially when you went to run a report, there was just, you know, like five joins or something just to get a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m actually looking at a query that you have in that blog post, and it&amp;#8217;s just obscene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s nuts, right? There&amp;#8217;s like, how many, six joins there, I think. And then, you know, if you just create a custom table, called like order post meta or something with where each column is a field, then you reduce that to one join, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: All you have to do is join the post table with this custom table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So you had a very specific set of meta fields, in this case related to an order, that you wanted to store, and you wanted to relate to an item in the post table, correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, and I think that makes sense. I think that&amp;#8217;s a really good example of something where a custom field does make, I mean, a custom table makes sense. Another example that I&amp;#8217;ve used, so like Restrict Content Pro, the plugin I was just talking about uses several custom tables. It uses one for discounts. It uses one for subscription levels. And it uses one for payments. And the payments is the big one because, like what you discovered, if you want to run a report, and you have a whole bunch of payment data that is stored in post meta, since each piece of the meta data is stored in its own row, you have to do a lot more work to get all of that info, as opposed to with a custom table all of it is one row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if you can very easily just say, show me the post meta for this record, you&amp;#8217;re done because it&amp;#8217;s one row. Like in RCP, the payments table that I have just has all of the different fields that you need: the user ID associated, the subscription ID, the amount, the status, the transaction ID, et cetera. And because all of that info is stored in one row, it&amp;#8217;s very easy to run a report or query. For example, I can very easily tell you exactly how much was earned over the last month or in the last six days all the time because you can do a very simple sum function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And I mean, you can still usually use the sum function or a count or whatever using post meta, but it&amp;#8217;s just really slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, and it&amp;#8217;s going to get slower and slower the more records you create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. I mean, so the meta value column in the meta tables are of type long text, which in SQL is not a very performant type of column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, it&amp;#8217;s not something that you can query on very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, exactly. And I&amp;#8217;m not even sure if you can index a long text column. It might not even be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I’m not sure on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But why would you either? In a table like that, in a key value store, there&amp;#8217;s really no point in indexing the value column, right, because the values are all different or different sets of data, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t really make a whole lot of sense to index that. Yeah, so I just think that you can gain a lot by having a custom table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely. In EDD, we actually use post meta for all of the payment records, and it&amp;#8217;s something that we&amp;#8217;ve managed to overcome some of the challenges pretty well, and so we can still run reports pretty easily that are very performant. But it was definitely challenging. And if I were to do it again, I would use a custom table. Knowing what I do now in terms of like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Do you use any custom tables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Do you have any custom tables in EDD at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Not in EDD, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Uh-uh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, so what&amp;#8217;s been &amp;#8212; I mean it&amp;#8217;s been kind of a fun challenge to overcome, but we&amp;#8217;ve realized pretty quickly on that storing everything in post meta, while it&amp;#8217;s super easy, presents some challenges and performance issues as well. So we had to work pretty hard to figure out how to get around those, and I think we achieved that really well because everything is very performant, and we can run all of those advanced reports like we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I was to do it again, I would not use post meta for several reasons. One, because it&amp;#8217;s easier to write an API that makes your data in your custom tables easily accessible for other users than it is to use the existing API in WordPress like get post meta, add post meta, et cetera, and make that performant with tons and tons of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I would not use post meta again, but we&amp;#8217;re also in a position where we can&amp;#8217;t really change it. I mean we could, but it&amp;#8217;d be very challenging to change it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I think the post meta tables, I think they were mainly designed originally for things to display kind of that&amp;#8217;s related to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think you&amp;#8217;re absolutely right. Well, if you look back to, I want to say Kubric did it, one of the old default themes, as well as some other themes. They display post meta automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It was very much meant to add custom data that you&amp;#8217;re going to display on a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And that&amp;#8217;s where, like, if you put an underscore at the beginning of your post key, your meta key, it sets it as private, so that doesn&amp;#8217;t automatically get displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right, and you can&amp;#8217;t edit it either from the custom tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. It was definitely designed for displaying data, not necessarily storing tons and tons of data in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And it&amp;#8217;s just kind of evolved because, I mean, you can use the WP_Query object now to query custom fields or post meta, we&amp;#8217;re calling it. Yeah, so I guess it&amp;#8217;s just evolved to this kind of beast that people can use to attach any kind of data to a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, absolutely. Well, and I think people realize very quickly some of the advantages of using, say, post meta or user meta instead of some custom tables. A couple things: Number one is, you don&amp;#8217;t pollute your database with additional tables that may not be needed when you stop using a plugin. Assuming, of course, you don&amp;#8217;t have an uninstall script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, two, it&amp;#8217;s just really easy. I mean, any developer who understands how to execute a function can suddenly store data very easily. And I don&amp;#8217;t think that necessarily wrong or bad or anything. Really, I think that&amp;#8217;s awesome. I think that shows that WordPress is very easy to &amp;#8212; it accommodates people very easily. But it also means that people will start trying to do things with it that it&amp;#8217;s not really designed for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yeah. What was your first point again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, that using post meta or user meta in a plugin can be really nice for developers, but also for users because it doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;pollute&amp;#8221; your database with, say, additional custom tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I guess I&amp;#8217;m going to debate you on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think my argument against that would be: but then the data that your plugins leave behind right now is just stored in your options table and harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like hidden there as opposed to being visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly, so it&amp;#8217;s worse. If you could just drop &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; the tables for the old plugin &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think they definitely both have their advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or disadvantages. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve used both, and I think there are great reasons for both methods as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I&amp;#8217;ve heard the argument that some database users won&amp;#8217;t have create, the create privilege to create new custom tables, but I don&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You know, I&amp;#8217;ve seen that as well, but I think it&amp;#8217;s kind of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Let&amp;#8217;s say in a plugin, and you don&amp;#8217;t have the create privilege, well, you&amp;#8217;re probably just doing it wrong. I mean, I have never seen somebody use the WP DB class and run into that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, plus, you wouldn’t be able to install WordPress itself if you didn&amp;#8217;t have that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s possible, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I mean, I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s happened, but it&amp;#8217;s got to be a stupid host issue or crazy security lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, I guess it&amp;#8217;s probably a good idea, security wise, to shut down that privilege if you don&amp;#8217;t really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, right, for certain users. But inside of your plugin, you should be running as a WordPress user anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, no, no, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because if you&amp;#8217;re not &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sorry, I&amp;#8217;m talking about &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Maybe I misunderstood what you were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, you totally did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I’m talking about the database user itself, so the MySQL user having &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; create table privilege on the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, the create table privilege, not the ability to insert data into a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, so that&amp;#8217;s the argument I&amp;#8217;ve heard is that &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; some environments &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So after WordPress was installed, that privilege was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I can see that happening. And if it does, then your plugin would fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I used to &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know if I ran into the create privilege problem, but I have run into problems where my custom table wouldn’t get created. And it has been very problematic for a couple of people who, for whatever reason, we couldn&amp;#8217;t make the table get created, and it might have been because of that. And it does cause some headaches for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And it was &amp;#8212; I think that when I was running into those challenges figuring out why my custom tables weren&amp;#8217;t getting created was one of the times when I started considering using the options table and post meta because, like, oh, this is so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So much more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think one thing that I would definitely like to, at least in my opinion, when it comes to custom tables, post meta and options and user meta are fantastic if you&amp;#8217;re not storing a lot of data. I would never create a custom data to store ten rows or five rows or whatever it is. Really, for me, I would only start creating custom tables if I had the potential of storing hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. So for me though, I think the rule is for me is if it&amp;#8217;s data that needs to be queried a lot &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; then I&amp;#8217;m going to put it in a custom table. I don&amp;#8217;t even care if it&amp;#8217;s one frickin&amp;#8217; column, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, no, I would totally agree. I don&amp;#8217;t mean you need to have a hundred &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t mean that you need to have lots and lots of columns. One column is great if you need to query on it. But the point is that if you have &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217;s say that you will never have more than ten rows for whatever data you&amp;#8217;re storing. There&amp;#8217;s no reason to put that into a custom table because, if you only have ten rows, you put it into one option and you just loop through the options inside of that option because you only have ten sets of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean your data &amp;#8212; at that point, your data is so small that there&amp;#8217;s no reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. A good example of a custom table that is very performant is the Post 2 Posts plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: They have a custom table that allows you to create links between two posts and that custom table just has two IDs in it, you know, two post guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Isn&amp;#8217;t it the ID of the post and then the ID of the connection or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, yeah, it has a connection ID, I guess, so three IDs, I guess it has in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So that the two posts that are related and then it&amp;#8217;s got like a primary key that&amp;#8217;s an auto increment column. Yeah, I mean, that&amp;#8217;s probably a good example of a custom table that is, you know, a great use case. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Because it performs very well and would not perform well at all if it was in post meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, not at all. Let&amp;#8217;s talk about a couple things related to custom tables that I think are important to consider. One of the advantages of post meta, user meta, options, et cetera, is that it&amp;#8217;s really easy to migrate between sites because it&amp;#8217;s automatically included in like the WordPress export and import or any other plugin that may do a database dump of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re using a plugin like WP Migrate DB Pro by some guy named Brad, then you&amp;#8217;re already covered because it supports custom tables. But one of the nice things about post meta and options is that you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about that. It&amp;#8217;s just going to migrate anyway. So that&amp;#8217;s something to consider for sure. If you need to make sure that your data is very portable, sometimes &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m not saying it&amp;#8217;s a reason to avoid custom tables, but it&amp;#8217;s something to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then another is having an API for your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Having the simple functions that allow you to insert, update, remove, and query data from your tables is very, very important because, especially if you&amp;#8217;re writing a plugin that might be extended by other people, definitely want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So like in RCP, in Restrict Content Pro, for example, I wrote a couple of classes that are like my database interaction classes for payments and discount codes that allow you to query payments, have all your options for dates, for users, for subscription, et cetera. And it just provides that simple API that makes things very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right. I feel like some developers feel like they need to kind of do things the WordPress way and kind of fit things into the current framework that WordPress kind of has laid out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Custom tables are a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, pretty much. I think some people &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There&amp;#8217;s a lot of that mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: There is. And I&amp;#8217;m here to say that it&amp;#8217;s BS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I used to think custom tables were wrong. And some of the &amp;#8212; this kind of happened for me because I first learned about making custom tables, and I would like this is the coolest, most powerful thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever done. This is so awesome! And so like I created a whole bunch of custom tables and some plugins for really stupid reasons. And that bit me later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at first I was like, custom tables are awesome! And then I started reading about, oh, well, maybe I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be using custom tables. Oh, look; I can dump all this data in the options table. Okay, custom tables are wrong. I&amp;#8217;m never going to touch them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly I started to get into a case where I needed to store a whole bunch of data and be able to query a well and have my own database structure. I&amp;#8217;m like, oh; custom tables are actually okay, and there are good reasons for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s very easy to fall into that trap that custom tables are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes. I don&amp;#8217;t know. That&amp;#8217;s the kind of sense that I&amp;#8217;ve gotten. I mean there are probably lots of examples out there where people are using custom table that they shouldn&amp;#8217;t be as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s definitely &amp;#8212; I think there&amp;#8217;s a balance to be had there. I think you need to really evaluate why you&amp;#8217;re using a custom table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And have good reasons for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think one of the number one reasons to use a custom table, and I think this is what you said earlier is that if you need to query the data, put it in a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If the data does not natively fit into the post table with the same kind of structure as the post table, then it should probably go into a custom table. Here&amp;#8217;s an example: I used to use a custom table &amp;#8212; sorry. No. I used to store something in the WP post table as a custom post type. And literally the only thing I was using was the post title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So the post table has what, like 10, 12 columns in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I was using the post title. That&amp;#8217;s the only thing I was using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I guess technically I had post ID and then any columns that had defaults that were filled in like post date. But my data was the post title only, and that was just silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. So you had a custom post-type set up for that, I&amp;#8217;m guessing, and you were just using the post title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, only using the post title. To me that&amp;#8217;s really silly because suddenly you have all of that extra database space that&amp;#8217;s just sitting there doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and you&amp;#8217;re making your post table slower by adding, you know &amp;#8212; I mean, especially if you&amp;#8217;re going to add a lot of those records to the post table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You could be making the query slower from then on. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m not going to get into why. There are reasons for that. It has to do with indexing and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But we won&amp;#8217;t get into that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Why don&amp;#8217;t we &amp;#8212; the same kind of subject, let&amp;#8217;s jump in to talk about session data and other temporary data and the ways that we can store that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure, yeah. It&amp;#8217;s interesting because right now the WP_Options table is just getting kind of all of that stuff just gets put into the WP_Options table. And I feel like that&amp;#8217;s probably not a good thing if we&amp;#8217;re talking about keeping the WP_Options table lean and performant. I feel like temporary data would be better off in its own table separate from the WP_Options table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, so why don&amp;#8217;t we backtrack just for a second? What we&amp;#8217;re talking about here is the idea of taking session data, so let&amp;#8217;s talk about ecommerce because this is, I think, the easiest example that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When we&amp;#8217;re talking about ecommerce, we have cart meta, so a customer comes to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Let&amp;#8217;s talk about EDD specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure, sure, we can talk about it because this is exactly what EDD does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Somebody comes to the site and adds something to their cart. They now have a session created for their user for that instance on the site where that data is stored so that we can persist that data across page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When you go from page A to page B, your cart data is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You&amp;#8217;ve got a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We use a system called &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You&amp;#8217;ve got a cookie set. Is that how it works? Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We have two different things that are set. Number one, there&amp;#8217;s a cookie set that contains an ID, which is basically their session ID. Then, two, we have a value added to the options table that contains all of their session data. And so that session data may be product IDs, price options, error messages, arbitrary fees added to the cart, anything that you might store in, if you think of what you might use a PHP session for, very similar kind of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Basically arrays of data. That&amp;#8217;s all stored into an option in the options table, so one row, kind of like a transient, but not quite. It&amp;#8217;s a little bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Do they expire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so that&amp;#8217;s all done through something that Eric Mann wrote called WP_Session, which is the idea of taking PHP sessions and bringing them into WordPress and supporting them across all platforms because, as anybody who&amp;#8217;s tried to use PHP sessions know, they&amp;#8217;re not supported on al hosts for some good reasons. But anyway, so we take this temporary cart data or the session data, and we store it in options. And then it gets purged over time, so there is a cron function that runs to go purge this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works really well, but it also has some disadvantages. If your site has a lot of traffic, it&amp;#8217;s possible that your options table may have thousands of rows. Now this session data, it&amp;#8217;s all set to auto load of no, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t slow down overall performance of the site itself for like page loads, but it can slow down the queries to the options table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Actually, it&amp;#8217;s probably worse for inserting, so every time you insert a record, it has to recalculate the index of the table, so the primary key index, and actually, probably, the meta key index as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So every time you do an insert is when you&amp;#8217;re really &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s like when your performance takes a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So having all this temporary data in there, like going in and out and in and out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Now that being said, it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily going to change a lot whether you&amp;#8217;re doing that in a custom table or in the options table in terms of what has to be re-indexed because basically it&amp;#8217;s a database right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I guess the difference is that it kind of keeps the temporary stuff separate from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It keeps it in one place. Yeah, it keeps it separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Keeps it separate, and then any time the WP_Options table, you know, anything is inserted into that, it would be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s the only difference really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. And this is the same system that we use it in EDD. WooCommerce uses a very similar system. Theirs is slightly different. The one that I use in EDD is pretty much WP_Session out of the box, exactly as Eric wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then WooCommerce uses a slightly modified version of it. I think they technically wrote their own, but it does the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It just looks a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I had a little discussion with Eric actually about WP_Session, and I was kind of asking what he thought about having a custom table for the session data and stuff, and he actually agreed. He thinks if it ever gets &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;d like to see a session that has its own table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, if it ever gets rolled into Core, he said that he would like to see it having its own, like a new Core table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s something that I&amp;#8217;ve considered it for EDD, creating our own session table. I know WP ecommerce uses their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think they do. I could be wrong. It&amp;#8217;s been a little while since I&amp;#8217;ve looked at theirs, but they have also a very similar system where they use a cookie to identify the session, and then they store the actual session data inside of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah. Hmm. Did you know that WooCommerce has custom tables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They use custom tables for orders and, I think, customers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s funny. They have a custom table for order items and a second table that&amp;#8217;s a key value store for like order item meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve seen that. I&amp;#8217;m not familiar enough with their database structure to know the reasons for that. I would assume it&amp;#8217;s basically you have an order ID and then here&amp;#8217;s the product IDs that were purchased in that, and it allows you to compare them easily. It would be my guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I can&amp;#8217;t really guess. I know that they would need a &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I have not used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think they need the key value store because it&amp;#8217;s flexible, right, so that people can extend it easily. I mean that&amp;#8217;s one of the greatest reasons that WordPress Core has that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that&amp;#8217;s because it&amp;#8217;s so easily extended and used, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: One of the issues that we did run into with session data stored in the WP_Options table is that you have to be very careful with it because it turns out, if you&amp;#8217;re familiar with how the options API works, options API has something called auto load. And so any option that is stored in the database with a value of auto load, so there&amp;#8217;s an auto load column, and then that value is either yes or no, anything that auto load is set to yes is automatically loaded into memory or via cache when WordPress is loaded, which means on every single page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have to be very careful when you store data in the options table. If you&amp;#8217;re storing potentially thousands of rows, you have to make sure that you don&amp;#8217;t accidentally set up auto load to yes because it will cause drastic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a bug that it was both EDD/WP_Session combined where options, the session data was originally created with auto load of no, which is the way that it should be. But then when the option got updated using the update option function, the auto load got changed to yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So we would end up with thousands of rows auto loaded and would cause horrific performance problems. And it&amp;#8217;s actually what we discovered, there was nowhere where we had accidentally just left off the auto load option, but it turns out the update option function does not allow you to specify auto load for yes or no. And there was some weird thing going on where, when the option was originally created using add option, it would be auto load no. But then when we&amp;#8217;d update it, it would become auto load yes, which was a little bit catastrophic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I imagine, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So it&amp;#8217;s something that, if you&amp;#8217;re using the options table to store transient data or to store temporary data, you need to be careful with it and make sure that you explicitly never set auto load to yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I guess the other thing that actually WordPress Core actually stores in the WP_Options table is transient, and that&amp;#8217;s pretty much, by definition, temporary data as well, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;d say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s expiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, it&amp;#8217;s very similar. I believe WP_Session originally used transients, I think, and then it changed to regular options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, when you look at it, a transient is nothing more than a row in the options table. It has a unique key set so that it expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty much all it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But the data doesn&amp;#8217;t actually clean itself out of the database until you call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So when you say get transient, it will go and look and see if the data, if that transient has expired. And if it is, it gets deleted at that time, not some other time before you ever loaded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s one of the things that WP_Session added as well is it actually has a cron job that will go through and look for expired sessions to delete them, so it auto cleans itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yep. Yeah, that makes sense. What do you think about plugins leaving data behind? What&amp;#8217;s your position on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: First of all, I think your plugin, regardless of whether it&amp;#8217;s storing data in custom tables, in options, in post meta, et cetera, should always have a cleanup routine. So when you uninstall a plugin, there should always be a way to remove all data associated with the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Should it &amp;#8212; so when you remove a plugin, I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s a hook for that. There&amp;#8217;s a hook for deactivating, but when &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s not during deactivation. It&amp;#8217;s during when you click delete from the plugins menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, but what if you delete it from the file system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, at that point what are you going to do? I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not like your code is there anymore, so you can&amp;#8217;t run from ghost code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right. But that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m saying. Do you do it on deactivation then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t do it on deactivation. I do it on the actual uninstall hook, so using the uninstall.php file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Are you familiar with that one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What&amp;#8217;s that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Are you familiar with the uninstall.php file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Uninstall.php, if you go and look at &amp;#8212; if you look at the &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s an activation hook and a deactivation hook in WordPress, and the deactivation one &amp;#8212; now I&amp;#8217;m forgetting how it works. If your plugin contains uninstall.php, the file actually called uninstall.php in the main plugin folder, that file will be executed when the plugin is deleted, by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s just how the plugin&amp;#8217;s API works. Let&amp;#8217;s say that I have a plugin that has a custom table, and I want to delete that table when my plugin is uninstalled. I will create an uninstall.php file, and then I will run the database queries inside of that file to delete my tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That allows you to do a cleanup process. In EDD, for example, we go through, and we delete our taxonomy terms. We delete the products. We delete any payment records. We delete all of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What if &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Now something to be very careful of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I think you&amp;#8217;re going where I was just going to ask. What if someone doesn&amp;#8217;t want to remove everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Something to be very careful of, make sure it&amp;#8217;s opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We used to automatically delete all the data when you deleted the plugin. Now WordPress actually gives you a really nice prompt. It auto-detects if you have uninstall.php, and it will give you a prompt that says, &amp;#8220;Do you really want to delete this plugin? By the way, this plugin will delete itself and all of its data if you click delete.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, people don&amp;#8217;t actually read, so a lot of times we would run into issues where somebody was trying to delete the plugin and install a different version. They&amp;#8217;d go to plugins, find the plugin, deactivate it, and then delete it, and the click the delete button, which would delete all of their data. Then they would install the new version and all their data is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if you&amp;#8217;re running uninstall.php, and it&amp;#8217;s one something that&amp;#8217;s actually storing important data, make sure that you have an opt-in system. What you can do is, you can just add an options to your settings page that says, &amp;#8220;Do you want to delete data when you uninstall this plugin?&amp;#8221; Then in uninstall.php, you check to make sure that that option is set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I feel like it might be better to kind of hook into the deactivate and then present them with like a little prompt that says, &amp;#8220;Would you like to delete all your data?&amp;#8221; Just kind of reminding them that there&amp;#8217;s a bunch of data there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, but one of the problems with deactivate is, people will deactivate plugins all the time for testing of conflicts or when you install an update for a plugin, it gets deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. But I mean it&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I don&amp;#8217;t actually remember if that fires a deactivation hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, but I just mean like you could just show it and allow them to kill it, to kill the message and just ignore it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know. I like the way that WordPress does it with uninstall.php. It doesn&amp;#8217;t require that you add any custom prompts or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Right, right, right. Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ll have to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They both work. It&amp;#8217;s something to play with if you&amp;#8217;ve never done it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. There&amp;#8217;s not a lot of data in my plugin in Migrate DB Pro, so I don&amp;#8217;t feel it&amp;#8217;s a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. A lot of times I think you can just kind of not worry about it. I mean if your plugin stores, say, one option in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: While it might be the responsible developer to go ahead and remove that on uninstall, it&amp;#8217;s not a big deal if you don&amp;#8217;t. Should you? Maybe. Now if your plugin is storing a ton of data, then if you uninstall, then yes, you should remove that data, as long as you tell people that you&amp;#8217;re going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And give them the chance to opt out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I was thinking of a little plugin idea, a tool that would kind of monitor your queries and determine, over time, options in your WP_Options table that have never been accessed in like the last six months or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;d be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Then you could take a look at them and say, oh, yeah, that&amp;#8217;s garbage; that&amp;#8217;s garbage. And just kind of remove the garbage. Have you ever heard of anything like that? Is there something out there like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No. Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t really know how that would work because that would mean that you would need to store something any time data is accessed, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, any time data is accessed in the WP_Options table specifically, you could just set a counter in like a different table somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And increment it, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know. I almost wonder. With the exception of some sites, like sites that have cart data or session data stored in options, most people&amp;#8217;s options tables are not going to be that large. I mean we&amp;#8217;re talking probably 200 rows would be considered large for a lot of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Maybe. If you disagree with me &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Throw in all the temporary data and then we&amp;#8217;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, right, but I&amp;#8217;m just thinking for most general sites, like scanning your options table for unused options is not difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because it&amp;#8217;s not usually that large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I think you&amp;#8217;re probably right. It&amp;#8217;s probably not much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If you do have a site that has thousands of rows and options, then sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think what happens though is most plugins don&amp;#8217;t clean up after themselves, so if you&amp;#8217;ve had a site since, you know, 2004 like myself, then ten years of installing plugins and uninstalling plugins that leave a bunch of garbage behind, your WP_Options table could look pretty bad. I’m pretty sure mine does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I was just kind of thinking of a way to kind of clean the cruft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s definitely a good idea if you are experiencing that, like where you have a lot of options in there, especially if they&amp;#8217;re set to auto load, yes, because it will cause some pretty bad performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If your admin is super slow or something like that, certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking of just migrating my posts table and then reconfiguring all the settings in my site, but that&amp;#8217;s a little scary because I could miss something, right? And then everything is broken, and I don&amp;#8217;t know how to fix it. Anyways, yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t know. I might write that plugin. It&amp;#8217;s not a big one or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It would be a cool plugin for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If anybody &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;d be very useful for those plugins that needed it, I mean for those sites that needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah. But maybe someone has a solution. They can let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, that would be great. Anything else about custom tables that we want to throw out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, I think we covered it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think a good summary is, just because a lot of people say don&amp;#8217;t ever use custom tables, don&amp;#8217;t listen to them. But don&amp;#8217;t necessarily go crazy and just writing custom tables all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Think about the way that your plugin or your theme or whatever it is that&amp;#8217;s storing custom data &amp;#8212; hopefully you&amp;#8217;re not creating custom tables and themes. But think about the way that your data is going to be stored and the way that it&amp;#8217;s going to be accessed. Think about the query performance, what you need to query, how you might need to change that data over time because if a custom table makes more sense in terms of performance, data accessibility, et cetera, go for it. That&amp;#8217;s a perfect reason why you should create a custom table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And especially if you&amp;#8217;re building a site for a client or you&amp;#8217;re building an app based on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Really, why not? Right? Why not squeeze some more power out of using a custom table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, you probably want to think about it a little bit more carefully when it comes to building a plugin or a theme that&amp;#8217;s being released to the public, whether free or commercial, just because, since you don&amp;#8217;t control every aspect of the site, there&amp;#8217;s more things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, whether it&amp;#8217;s conflicts with other plugins, user permissions, whatever it may be, there are more points of failure or issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There&amp;#8217;s more points where you could run into issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep. But that being said, if you have a really good reason to use a custom table, there are other plugins doing it, and take a look at WooCommerce. Take a look at Post 2 Posts. And see what they&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I think something else to consider, and this might be a good conversation for another episode, is what do you do when you realize that you need to change architecture and you need to try and migrate all of that data because that could be a real challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It is fun. I recently did it. I had an update. I completely changed the architecture for my software licensing extension for Easy Digital Downloads. And I had to write an upgrade routine that could theoretically change 10 to 100,000 rows in the database successfully without failing. And that was kind of a daunting task. Luckily it worked, and I succeeded. And so far have not reported a single failure, which was pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But something to consider because if you&amp;#8217;re using custom tables or you&amp;#8217;re not using custom tables, and you need to swap it to use the other or just to make any kind of architecture changes, like when you&amp;#8217;re talking about when you&amp;#8217;re storing a lot of data, the way that you store it is really important because it&amp;#8217;s going to be there forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so if you ever have to change it, it can really bite you in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Anyway, maybe that&amp;#8217;s a conversation for the next episode or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Anything else you want to throw out there, Brad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, I think we should wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right. Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: All right. Well, thanks, everybody. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>For episode 12 we decided to tackle the subject of using custom database tables in plugins. Should you use them? Are the postmeta, usermeta, or options tables better? Worse? There are many, many aspects to consider when it comes to structure your plugins data storage. We both have experience with using all of the above methods and use our experience to weigh in on the benefits and disadvantages to using each of them.

BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Im your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost Pippin Williamson.

PIPPIN: Hi, everyone.

BRAD: Today were going to be talking about custom database tables in WordPress.

PIPPIN: This episode, as well as previous episodes, were once again sponsored by WP Ninjas, the creators of Ninja Forms, which is a great, free plugin for WordPress that allows you to create contact forms, surveys, et cetera.

A little piece of news from them: they recently released a really cool new extension thats called Table Editor. So when submitting your forms, if you want the users who are submitting to fill in tabular data, rows and columns of a whole bunch of different data that you may need, whether its T-shirt sizes or user info, anything else that you might need, this extension allows you to do that very easily. So you can check it out at NinjaForms.com. Thank you once again for their sponsorship.

BRAD: That sounds really cool. I am going to check that out.

PIPPIN: Yeah, its pretty sweet. It gives you like a spreadsheet view in the form submission.

BRAD: Yeah. Cool! So should we talk about some custom database tables?

PIPPIN: Yeah, but lets actually first give a quick mention about what weve been working on recently.

BRAD: Sure.

PIPPIN: I think we kind of skipped over that last time, and there are a few things that might be fun mentioning.

BRAD: Sure.

PIPPIN: What have you been working on?

BRAD: Yeah, so my renewals are coming up soon. My customers are going to be renewing their licenses for the first time.

PIPPIN: This is for WP Migrate DB Pro?

BRAD: That’s right, yeah. And so I just need to do some testing around that and kind of make sure everything is in order, so Ive been working on that. What have you been working on?

PIPPIN: Cool! Outside of Easy Digital Downloads, which, for anybody who is listening is probably familiar, is kind of my main project. My other primary project that I work on is a membership plugin called Restrict Content Pro, and Ive been working on getting version 2.0 written up.

For the last six or seven months, the plugin has been not really stagnated, but Ive only been doing maintenance releases on it, fixing little bugs here and there, occasional minor features. But now Im actively working on version 2.0, which Im trying to put a whole bunch of the new features in that have been requested for months, years by a whole bunch of different users.

BRAD: Cool!

PIPPIN: And so Ive got some of it finished up.

BRAD: Is Chris Coyier using that for his site?

PIPPIN: Yeah. Its the plugin that runs the lodge at css-tricks.com.

BRAD: Thats cool.

PIPPIN: Which is fun. Yeah, Ive gotten to work with Chris a couple of times on bugs, feature requests, things like that. His is a great site as an example of like what the plugin is good for.

BRAD: Nice.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Apply Filters, Episode 11. Today we have a special guest, Dan Griffiths, with us, as well as our usuals, myself and my cohost Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hi, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Dan, please say hi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We&amp;#8217;re going to first start out by giving a quick shout out to our sponsors. WP Ninjas, the creators behind Ninja Forms, have been kind enough to sponsor this episode, and so they are the creators of Ninja Forms and a couple of other great plugins for creating contact forms, surveys, other types of things that you need to do with a form plugin, and so go check them out at NinjaForms.com or WPNinjas.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, why don&amp;#8217;t we go ahead and jump into things? Dan, why don&amp;#8217;t you tell us a little bit about who you are, what you do, what your day-to-day schedule looks like, things like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, who I am, I&amp;#8217;m a WordPress plugin developer predominantly. I spend a lot of time working with Pippin on Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Dan has been an active contributor to that project for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Nine months now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Since &amp;#8212; I looked at it. I think it was either February or November of last year, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Since like February. I can&amp;#8217;t remember. Oh, no. You know what it was? It was March was when that commit got in the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;s been a while. Aside from that, what else do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Aside from that, I&amp;#8217;m the founder of a project called Redux Framework. And what Redux is, it is a theme and plugin options framework for WordPress. Basically it&amp;#8217;s designed to allow developers of plugins or themes to easily create a full-scale options panel for their plugin with basically minimal coding on their part, kind of similar to like Options Tree and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: But we&amp;#8217;ve kind of gone a different route and tried to make it a lot simpler for the user and a lot more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool. So it&amp;#8217;s really for implement, like creating a settings screen, a really advanced setting screen in a plugin or a theme that then gets either distributed on, say, WordPress.org or Theme Force or CodeCanyon, something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yes, and we actually have kind of gone out of our way to make sure that we&amp;#8217;re maintaining compatibility with both of their licensing models so it is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Brad, have you ever used Redux?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. I have never even heard of it. Well, I had really no reason to look for this kind of solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, you don&amp;#8217;t do a whole lot with setting screens. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve seen your setting &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; on WP Migrate DB Pro. It&amp;#8217;s like three fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: You would not be my target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. Oh, I see. So this works for plugins as well as themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep, and we are currently, I believe, the only one that is specifically targeting both, which is really cool. I&amp;#8217;ve used &amp;#8212; I know a year or two ago I used the &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ve used both Options Tree and Options Framework from Devin Price, and I think it was specifically for themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which works well, and is really cool, but I do love the idea that you&amp;#8217;re targeting both because, when you really get down to the technical aspects, there&amp;#8217;s not really anything different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: There are a few changes. There&amp;#8217;s a few things that a lot of the options frameworks historically have done that are based on like functions specific to themes like, you know, using get style sheets, you know, or get style sheet directory for, you know, determining the plugin route or the theme route, which obviously doesn&amp;#8217;t work in a plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: So, you know, there are some things that we had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But overall, in terms of like the overall settings are….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: The overall, the basics, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: …setting the pages themselves, they&amp;#8217;re not that much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So who does your design, Dan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. So you have a little bit of a design background then as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: A little bit. Honestly, I&amp;#8217;m no really much of a designer. I&amp;#8217;m more of a developer. I can kind of fake it when I have to. In all honesty though, not all of the graphics on that site are mine. Some of them I&amp;#8217;ve kind of snagged from other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hey, the best designers steal, right? Isn&amp;#8217;t that the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It seems to be the way. It works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I can tell you, you&amp;#8217;re far better at it than I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think the exact saying is, &amp;#8220;Good designers borrow, great designers steal,&amp;#8221; or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I saw that the other day. We&amp;#8217;re not advocating stealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, unless you&amp;#8217;re a designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, this looks really good. I mean, clearly you have some, definitely a mind for design, so it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve played with it a few times. It&amp;#8217;s really pretty and works very, very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: All right. In all fairness, the design for the panel itself is not really 100% mine. A lot of that, a lot of the credit for that goes to my lead developer, Dovy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So you actually have a team that works on Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I do have a team. I have a handful of full time or semi full-time developers that are working with me on it. And I believe right now we have 17 active contributors who have actually made more than 1 commit in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome. And you have it all open source on GitHub, don&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It is 100% open source, and it is 100% GPL compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. So are you using like some kind of widget UI library or something here, or did you guys build out your own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: No, it is 100% our code. It is custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So like the color picker, you guys &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Okay. That actually is based on the default WordPress color picker, but we rewrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Because we wanted to add the ability to do the RGBA compatibility in the actual transparency selector on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Cool. It looks a lot like Bootstrap, Twitter Bootstrap UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Parts of our system are based on Bootstrap, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, awesome. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So day-to-day, I know that you work on Redux a lot. You also spend some time on EDD. What is maybe your normal dev day look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Normal is such an abstract word. I think the only normal part of my day is the getting up in the morning and getting a cup of coffee. After that, it kind of depends. I spend a lot of time traveling, as Pippin can attest because I keep coming and harassing him. I spend a lot of time working with clients. I have a handful of clients outside of EDD and Redux that I work with on a fairly regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: As like a freelance contractor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah. And that can be anything from, you know, someone saying, &amp;#8220;I need a plugin,&amp;#8221; to someone saying, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t understand WordPress. Can you build me a website?&amp;#8221; My day generally begins at like 8:00, 8:30, sometimes earlier if I&amp;#8217;m actually conscious at that point in time. It all depends on how the night went. And then I pretty much work straight through until about 2:00, have lunch at 2:00, and then work straight through until about midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Very cool. Yeah. I know I see you&amp;#8217;re always online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You&amp;#8217;re always online when I&amp;#8217;m online, except then I also see that I get up in the morning, and Dan has texted me at like 3:00 in the morning. And as far as I could tell, you&amp;#8217;ve never gone to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: No. I get like two to three hours of sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Holy crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: For some reason, when I&amp;#8217;m at these WordCamps, I tend to sleep a lot more. I think WordCamps have become my way of catching up on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, yeah. I guess &amp;#8212; Dan and I are actually currently sitting in our hotel room at WordCamp Phoenix, which is pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And I am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. You&amp;#8217;re up in cold Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s not cold here. I&amp;#8217;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And envious of their warm climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m very sorry. It&amp;#8217;s about 75 degrees outside right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: In all fairness, it&amp;#8217;s pretty cold at home for us too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s true, it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We&amp;#8217;re both from the Midwest, Kansas and Nebraska, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty cold there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Oh, well. I&amp;#8217;ll be in Vegas in April for Microcom, so I&amp;#8217;ve got that to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So, Dan, how did you start with WordPress, like when did it all start for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It&amp;#8217;s been seven or eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I started with WordPress. Actually, when I first got into WordPress, I had never done Web development beyond basic HTML. I mean, I had a basic grasp of PHP, but wasn&amp;#8217;t really a Web developer. I was a desktop developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into WordPress, I actually worked on an operating system called Arch Linux. I was a core developer for them. And I&amp;#8217;d been doing open source Linux desktop development for the better part of my life. And WordPress came along, and all of a sudden it changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool to me because I used to run Arch on desktop, and it was my primary operating system, so here I am sitting here, like you were one of the lead developers for my old operating system. That&amp;#8217;s so cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Sadly, you don&amp;#8217;t use it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, I don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, I can&amp;#8217;t really say anything because neither do I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What do you guys use now, Ubuntu?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;m an Ubuntu user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It depends on which computer you&amp;#8217;re talking about. My laptop that comes with me to WordCamps is actually running Windows 8, which really drives me nuts. But that really comes down to I haven&amp;#8217;t taken the time to fix that. My desktop at home is actually running, I guess you could call it, a custom Linux distro. It&amp;#8217;s kind of my own spin on how I think Linux should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool. Pretty hard core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, it&amp;#8217;s like six or seven years in the making now, and I&amp;#8217;m still not happy enough with it to actually release it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, now it makes sense why you don&amp;#8217;t sleep. So during the day you&amp;#8217;re doing WordPress stuff, and then at night you&amp;#8217;re like hacking away at Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Actually, it doesn&amp;#8217;t really work that way. It&amp;#8217;s more along the lines of I&amp;#8217;m working on WordPress and then something happens in my operating system that I don&amp;#8217;t like, and I go, &amp;#8220;It shouldn&amp;#8217;t do that. It should work this way.&amp;#8221; And so I step aside for a minute and rewrite part of my Linux system, and then I come back to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: See, that sounds a little bit like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; what used to be my day-to-day, except slightly different. I would be working. I&amp;#8217;d be doing whatever it was. Generally it was client work back then. And all of a sudden I would break something on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And instead of just like fixing it, I&amp;#8217;d spend like four hours trying to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: (Indiscernible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And then I&amp;#8217;d end up just like reinstalling my entire computer, and there was my day. And that would happen about every three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: See, the difference is I don&amp;#8217;t reinstall. I just recompile whatever the project is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: &amp;#8212; program is that&amp;#8217;s causing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think, Dan, you just highlighted exactly why I don&amp;#8217;t use Linux because I&amp;#8217;d be like so distracted by like the imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Okay. So in that case do what Pippin does and just use Ubuntu. It doesn&amp;#8217;t actually let you do anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It&amp;#8217;s not….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s actually true. Ubuntu is really like the &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the normal person version of Linux. Like if you think about like OS X or Windows, something like that, but you want to use Linux, and you want a little bit more control, Ubuntu is where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right, right. I think I &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: As much as I hate Ubuntu, I will admit it is extremely stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s very stable and very polished. It&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think I stuck with &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m going to stick with OS X. The reason I went with OS X is because you can run Photoshop. That&amp;#8217;s pretty much the only reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: See, I just &amp;#8212; I used to actually keep a computer around to run Photoshop, and then I got rid of it, and I&amp;#8217;d like &amp;#8212; it was the same time that I quit contract development, and I decided I don&amp;#8217;t need Photoshop anymore. And for like on a day-to-day basis. I would still run into things where I needed it and it was really annoying, but it was also kind of awesome because it forced me to do things a little bit differently. And I have to actually opened Photoshop in a year and a half, and I do not even have a copy on my computer anymore. I have a computer that can run it now, but I don&amp;#8217;t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Do you have a little counter like days, days since last opened Photoshop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: …days since Photoshop. Why don&amp;#8217;t we &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s like days without an accident kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, awesome. I should start a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Are you implying that Photoshop is an accident?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No. Why don&amp;#8217;t we jump back into WordPress for a second? And, Dan, so aside from Redux, I know that you&amp;#8217;ve written a couple of other plugins. Aside from Redux, what is maybe the most popular plugin that you&amp;#8217;ve written?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Aside from Redux and EDD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I mean, we know that &amp;#8212; we already know that you contribute to EDD. But I know there&amp;#8217;s….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, no. I don&amp;#8217;t mean EDD itself. I&amp;#8217;m talking about plugins for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure, sure, that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Because I would &amp;#8212; you know, I&amp;#8217;m really not sure. I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of plugins in the repo that are ridiculously popular, but I don&amp;#8217;t know as though I would say that they&amp;#8217;re more popular than some of my EDD ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Why don&amp;#8217;t you just tell us a couple of what they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, EDD PDF Stamper obviously is one of my more popular ones for EDD. It hasn&amp;#8217;t really been out that long, so there really aren&amp;#8217;t as many users as I think there were going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. And what, that allows someone to download a PDF and like put a watermark on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Basically, yeah. If you have a PDF that is for sale on an EDD site, it allows you to dynamically stamp that at like with … a watermark or anything pretty much whenever a user downloads that file. So you can actually, you know, you have a PDF and you want it to be registered, so to speak, to a specific user when they purchase it and they download it. Then you can stamp it with their name and their purchase ID. Or you can put a literal watermark on it if you want to have your company&amp;#8217;s logo on it, or pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s definitely great for, I mean, anybody who is selling like sensitive information with PDFs or things that you need to be very closely tied to users and help ensure that they&amp;#8217;re not redistributing that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: That was probably my biggest nightmare plugin for a long time, but it&amp;#8217;s also turning into one of my more popular ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I know we had some support issues with it. I think it was a good example of a plugin that highlights issues that you run into with different hosting accounts with just people having different configurations, different options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It also highlights the need to actually properly error handle your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, sure because you would have &amp;#8212; there would be an error like something would just fail, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t tell you why it would fail, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: In all fairness, that was not my fault. I had no control of that. PDF Stamper relies on FPDF and FPDI, which are PDF libraries for PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: The problem with this is that while FPDF is basically the de facto like everyone uses it, PDF library for PHP scripts. It also kind of sucks because it doesn&amp;#8217;t actually do any real error checking. If it runs into an error that it doesn&amp;#8217;t know how to handle, it just gives you a generic &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t do this&amp;#8221; message, which resulted in a lot of headaches for us on the support side because we&amp;#8217;d have users that say, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m getting this error.&amp;#8221; And I&amp;#8217;d look at it and go, &amp;#8220;This error means nothing, so I don&amp;#8217;t know how to fix it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, super annoying. Brad, have you ever worked with FPDF or FPDI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. No, I&amp;#8217;ve never even heard of it. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Don&amp;#8217;t do it. It&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: If you need it, just send it to me. I&amp;#8217;m used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s an unfortunate headache that unfortunately there&amp;#8217;s not really better alternatives at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know why it is. Maybe working with PDFs is really hard. I&amp;#8217;ve never tried to do it in PHP. But it&amp;#8217;s really the only option out there. If you searched for like &amp;#8212; go to Google and do like PHP PDF parsing or like writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: There are two others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay. There are two others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yes. There&amp;#8217;s one called MPDF, which is supposed to be a better version of FPDF. I&amp;#8217;m trying to remember what the differences are. I know it supports UTF-8 where the core of FPDF doesn&amp;#8217;t. And there were a few other changes, but it&amp;#8217;s not actually 100% compatible, so it&amp;#8217;s not really a drop-in replacement. And then there&amp;#8217;s TFPDF; I think it is. Isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think that&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Wasn&amp;#8217;t that the other one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They&amp;#8217;re all named almost exactly the same thing, which makes them really difficult to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: But what it comes down to is that in terms of compatibility and in terms of size, FPDF is basically the one that everyone uses because the other ones are either not really compatible with everyone else&amp;#8217;s code, or are just huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t really like &amp;#8212; I don’t really enjoy working with PDFs, but unfortunately it&amp;#8217;s kind of a necessary evil sometimes when you get into selling digital products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I like Git….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I definitely worked with PDFs a while back. I can&amp;#8217;t remember what I used. I may have used FPDF. But I needed to generate invoices for my company, Web hosting company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s exactly. That&amp;#8217;s one of the things that we also use it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Like we have PDF invoices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Anyway, I remember whatever I used, it was fairly painless to use. Maybe I should look it up and let you guys know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That would be awesome. Maybe we&amp;#8217;ve just been using the wrong thing and never knew it. One of the issues that I know we ran into, both with Dan&amp;#8217;s plugin and another plugin that someone else wrote for EDD, is that it would work for the vast majority of users, but then if you get somebody who is displaying like UTF characters, for example like the euro sign &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; would freak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Oh, God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And a lot of other things like that where, as &amp;#8212; like when we are testing it, generally we&amp;#8217;re testing it in with English and with U.S. characters primarily, and we don&amp;#8217;t run into any of these kinds of issues. But then when you start getting into say Arabic or Hebrew or Cantonese or any other alphabet, then it starts being much more troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And that&amp;#8217;s what I think where the bulk of our support issues came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: That or compatibility with hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Unfortunately, PDF Parsing does not work very well on a lot of shared hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I kind of take it with a point of pride and this really shouldn&amp;#8217;t be happening, but PDF Stamper, I believe, is the only plugin that EDD has right now that actually has a disclaimer on the plugin page that says don&amp;#8217;t buy this if you have these hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s true. Yeah, we ended up &amp;#8212; we found that there were a couple of severe problems that we couldn&amp;#8217;t resolve on a particular host or two, and so we had to just say, &amp;#8220;Hey, look, I&amp;#8217;m sorry. If you&amp;#8217;re using this host, we can&amp;#8217;t help you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which was really unfortunately. I hate the fact that sometimes you have to do that, but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, sometimes hosts, just like some of them are just really crazy about like security lockdown or, you know, one thing or another. Sometimes they refuse to install like a standard PHP extension or they have it disabled for some reason. You know, sometimes you just get these oddball hosts that are, you know, dead against certain things for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I just looked up my old code and, yep, FPDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So I don&amp;#8217;t have a better solution for you, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah. Oh, well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Dan, are you &amp;#8212; you&amp;#8217;re not related to Clay Griffiths, are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: No. I&amp;#8217;ve been asked that before though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Let me rephrase that. Let me rephrase that. Not that I&amp;#8217;m aware of. Anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It would not be a bad relation to have. Clay is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Smart guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Clay Griffiths, of course, for those who don&amp;#8217;t know, is one of the founders of Headway, a theme framework and all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. A pretty cool system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve seen the code behind it, and it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; Clay is a geneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. How old is that guy now, like 20?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: 19, 20. No, wait, no, he just turned 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. He can drink now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think so, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If he chooses to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Because every time that I&amp;#8217;ve been with him at a conference, we&amp;#8217;re going to the after party or something, and he&amp;#8217;s like, oh, guy, I can&amp;#8217;t go. I’m like, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I think we&amp;#8217;ve got one more question for you, Dan, and then I think we&amp;#8217;re going to move on to some plugin picks that we want to talk about a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: All right. What do you got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Have you ever contributed to WordPress Core, either in terms of bug reports, patches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I&amp;#8217;ve submitted my share of bug reports, not a whole lot, but a few of them. Sadly, I don&amp;#8217;t have any actual code that&amp;#8217;s been committed to Core yet. Most of that doesn&amp;#8217;t come down to I don&amp;#8217;t want to, and it comes down to I just don&amp;#8217;t have the time to right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. I think that&amp;#8217;s probably one of the hardest things for a lot of people in terms of contributing to Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I have lots and lots and lots of things that I would love to see happen with Core, and some of them I have open bug reports on or have commented on other people&amp;#8217;s bug reports on. But I just haven&amp;#8217;t really gotten around to actually committing anything yet, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Bug reports are a big part of contributing, I mean, to any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: It&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: True.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Brad, do you want to take us away with your &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; plugin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, okay. So the plugin I&amp;#8217;ve chosen is called Better WP Security. And I tried this out a while back just because, you know, there&amp;#8217;s probably some stuff with my blog and my other sites that are on WordPress that could probably be, you know, strengthened in terms of security. So I gave this a try and a couple other plugins. But I thought this plugin was very comprehensive. It had a lot of different kind of angles on security to take a look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in the end, the plugin didn&amp;#8217;t really work out. It was causing the memory on my server to go crazy. So I shut it down. But I did learn a lot of things that I could kind of fix up using htaccess rules and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So did it reveal some of those, I guess, weak points by like going through and identifying common areas that could be improved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And it&amp;#8217;s laid out really nicely in the dashboard, so if you go to the admin screen for the plugin, it kind of has a tab for each kind of area where you can &amp;#8212; kind of security area where you can kind of strengthen things. So one of the tabs is like, it&amp;#8217;s called user, for example. And it encourages you to make sure that your user name is not admin, which is the default user name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Not any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Not any more. But it was for &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There&amp;#8217;s still a ton of sites out there that still have admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, a thousand years, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s been admin &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It felt like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; until it recently changed. But another thing on this tab it tells you to do is that the ID, change your ID from one, which is the default user ID, to a different number. So that&amp;#8217;s like, that&amp;#8217;s probably a very unlikely thing to be exploited, but it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I have to laugh a little bit when you say that &amp;#8212; sorry to interrupt you for a second &amp;#8212; because one of my favorite security flow that I ever created by accident was related to user IDs with one, the user ID of one. And I had a bug that allowed someone to log into a site without a password or user name because basically like it was identifier the user as like invalid, and so we used like negative one to identify the user, which was a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it got run through AppsINT, which turned it into one. And then it tried to log the user in. And sure enough, there&amp;#8217;s a user, and they&amp;#8217;re an admin. So that&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8212; I mean, it may seem silly to change your user ID, but if you have a plugin that&amp;#8217;s not necessarily being malicious, but just has like a little, obscure bug like that, it can actually have pretty bad consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. So those are two things that WP or Better WP Security plugin can do for you. And then you can just, you know, disable the plugin if you don&amp;#8217;t want it running all the time, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So there&amp;#8217;s quite a few things like that. There&amp;#8217;s like the prefix, your table prefix. It can change that for you, and all the &amp;#8212; because changing your table prefix isn&amp;#8217;t as simple as just renaming your tables. There are other things that you need to do. And there&amp;#8217;s, yeah, there&amp;#8217;s other things like backups, making sure to lock down certain files and all that stuff. So check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan, you&amp;#8217;ve used this plugin too, haven&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah. I actually did a review of it during a security lecture I gave a month and change ago. It&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; I will agree with you that it is a very comprehensive plugin. My one issue with it is that for someone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know what they&amp;#8217;re doing it can be downright dangerous. It does give you a lot of information. It gives you a lot of great information. However, some of the things that it recommends doing can certainly damage your site if you do it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: And it doesn&amp;#8217;t really hold your hand a whole lot through the process. It kind of just says, &amp;#8220;Here&amp;#8217;s a problem. Click here to fix it.&amp;#8221; Well, their fix doesn&amp;#8217;t always work in every situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. So you&amp;#8217;re saying like it&amp;#8217;s definitely not something that, you know, just an average WordPress user should do. It&amp;#8217;s something that&amp;#8217;s for a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Right. Well, no, not necessarily even that. I don&amp;#8217;t see there being a problem with a user activating it and looking at the information it gives you and saying, &amp;#8220;Okay, here&amp;#8217;s a problem. Now how do I fix it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you know, even for a basic user, it would be a lot smarter for them to take that information and then go to Google and say, &amp;#8220;Here&amp;#8217;s what it&amp;#8217;s telling me. Now how do I fix this in principle as opposed to just clicking the magic button and hoping it does it right.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Maybe like what are the repercussions of this failing if the fix doesn&amp;#8217;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Exactly. The first time I ever actually used the Better WP Security plugin, I actually crippled my site &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: &amp;#8212; because I didn&amp;#8217;t take that advice because I hadn&amp;#8217;t previewed it yet, and I just pressed the fix problem button, and it actually took my site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That can definitely happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And this plugin has actually been acquired. It&amp;#8217;s a free plugin and everything, but the author now works at iThemes: Chris Wiegman. I think it&amp;#8217;s how you pronounce his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And then iThemes have kind of taken over development, so it might be getting some love in….&lt;br /&gt;
DAN: I have high hopes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I would have. I have huge hopes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: They&amp;#8217;re….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, iThemes has obviously got a very strong repertoire of building great plugins, everything from BackUpBuddy to Exchange. Great company. Great people. And they know what they&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s awesome. So I had two plugins that I want to highlight. One of them I&amp;#8217;m just going to mention really quickly. If you ever need to do custom CSS on your site, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of custom CSS plugins out there. There are also a lot of times themes will build in a custom CSS panel. I like to warn people that using a custom CSS panel provided by your theme is not necessarily a great idea because, if you switch themes, that CSS goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that CSS might have been written specifically for your theme, so it might not matter. But, in general, I think custom CSS should be relegated to a plugin. And so Andrew Norcross from Reaktiv Studios built a really nice, custom CSS plugin called Reaktiv CSS Builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing that I like about it more so than most custom CSS plugins is that instead of simply outputting the CSS in a styles tag in line in the header, it actually generates a real CSS file and then puts that into the site. And so that file can then be cached. You can minimize it. All the things that you would do with a normal CSS file loaded through a plugin or a theme, which is really slick. So go check that one out. It&amp;#8217;s Reaktiv CSS Builder. It&amp;#8217;s on WordPress.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other plugin, and this is one that I do not have a personal use for, but I think is a really cool idea. And the execution of it was beautiful. And it&amp;#8217;s called Stream. Stream, it&amp;#8217;s from the X-Team, which is led by Frankie Jerrett, who I believe also ran ChurchThemes.net. And it was built by a lot of different people that are involved with the X-Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it does is it allows you to track activity in your site. So let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a site, and you have this plugin activated. It will track user logins. It will track changes to posts, new post types that are created, taxonomies that are created, media files uploaded, comments posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tracks updates to WordPress and to plugins. So let&amp;#8217;s say that your site is running great today, and then some time overnight you do an update to WordPress Core or you do an update to a plugin, and suddenly your site is having a lot of trouble. You can go into Stream, and it will tell you what happened. So it will say this plugin was activated. This plugin was updated. WordPress Core was updated, et cetera. And it&amp;#8217;s really, really cool, and &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s kind of like Blame in Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, exactly. It&amp;#8217;s basically let&amp;#8217;s see a history of what&amp;#8217;s happened on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I think, going forward with WordPress, especially with the 3.8 release where we now have the automatic updates, the background updates built into WordPress, I think that&amp;#8217;s going to be seeing a lot of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I would agree because, I mean, sometimes &amp;#8212; I mean, we know that automatic updates are extremely reliable and, in general, are going to cause very, very, very few problems. But it&amp;#8217;s still a nice thing to have, to have that history that says we ran an update yesterday at 10:00 p.m. or a new plugin was installed at 3:00 p.m. today, and this is the user that installed it. It&amp;#8217;s like taking the idea of a social network stream, like an activity feed from your friends and your connections, and putting them into your WordPress admin to see the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Now I have a question on this. Something like this, we&amp;#8217;re talking about this thing is actually tracking basically everything that happens on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Wouldn&amp;#8217;t that have like a ridiculously high memory footprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You would think. I did a code review of it for them, and I was really pleased. They have taken performance really seriously. And it does not &amp;#8212; it stores everything in custom tables that they&amp;#8217;ve optimized really well, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t store anything in the post table or post meta, which are sometimes responsible for slowing down sites more so than other tables. And the way that they record their actions has very minimal footprint. The only thing that it&amp;#8217;s doing is it&amp;#8217;s basically inserting a value into a table when you do these kinds of actions. But since these are admin actions usually, having an extra like two milliseconds on an action is not really a big deal, as opposed to like adding two milliseconds to a page load on the front end is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But in the admin, in terms of doing these kinds of things, it&amp;#8217;s not necessarily as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The one note is it does require 5.3 or higher for PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Okay. Honestly &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which honestly should not be &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: &amp;#8212; why should anyone &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Why would anyone have below 5.3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That shouldn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Not that we don&amp;#8217;t run into it on a weekly basis, but you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be running anything older than 5.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It really shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a problem that we need to require 5.3 or that we need to tell people that are required 5.3, but there are still enough hosts out there that run 5.2….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: If your host is running 5.2, you might want to change hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s probably true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: If your host is running 5.2, it&amp;#8217;s probably just an old server, and they probably have another one, and are eager to get you off that server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Speaking from a former Web host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I used to host. We used to have that problem, right? When shared hosting, you have clients on older servers, right? But oftentimes they have older software running on those servers. And if you upgrade them, their software will explode because it doesn&amp;#8217;t support some of the new features in PHP 5.3 or whatever. And so you have this dilemma of like can you actually move a site? Maybe. Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Write better code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I wish we could say that like writing better code was the answer to everything, but sometimes old code can&amp;#8217;t be updated, which is unfortunate, but it&amp;#8217;s the truth of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s a willingness thing sometimes too, like, you know, if it&amp;#8217;s WordPress, and they haven&amp;#8217;t hacked the Core, then updating shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But oftentimes it&amp;#8217;s like an old version of OS Commerce that has like a ton of hacks in it and like the client just doesn&amp;#8217;t want to deal with updating it for PHP 5.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s true. Well, I mean, sometimes the benefit of upgrading doesn&amp;#8217;t outweigh the time that it takes to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I wish that wasn&amp;#8217;t as true, but &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I don&amp;#8217;t know if I agree with that. I mean &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I just mean like let&amp;#8217;s say you have a site that is more or less self-contained. I mean it just runs fine. There are no problems with it. Sometimes upgrading just for upgrading&amp;#8217;s sake, it&amp;#8217;s kind of &amp;#8212; I mean, aside from like fixing security bugs, obviously, it&amp;#8217;s kind of like the same idea of re-factoring code for the sake of re-factoring code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think there&amp;#8217;s a lack of &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, you need to have &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; a lack of understanding with customers oftentimes that, you know, they don&amp;#8217;t have to maintain the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That once it&amp;#8217;s built, it&amp;#8217;s kind of set in stone, and it&amp;#8217;s good to go forever, you know, rather than &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is definitely not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: That is a very depressing attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, but I mean I think it&amp;#8217;s true. I think &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And it&amp;#8217;s our job to like change, you know, minds, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely. I mean it&amp;#8217;s very common. And I think a lot of it is not necessarily that users or customers have an attitude that says, &amp;#8220;Oh, this never needs to be updated.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s that they&amp;#8217;re not, it&amp;#8217;s not their area of expertise, so they&amp;#8217;re not &amp;#8212; put it this way: they&amp;#8217;re not really educated on the reasons why you should do that, I mean, because, to a lot of people, if they&amp;#8217;re not a developer or they&amp;#8217;re not familiar with the ways that software works, I mean, it works, so why would it stop working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Well, that kind of comes back to it&amp;#8217;s the developer&amp;#8217;s own responsibility to know what software or, you know, what their system depends on. And if there is a major update, then they need to look into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: I mean I had a plugin or two that horribly broke with the WordPress 3.8 update because I was depending on CSS Classes and IDs that didn&amp;#8217;t exist anymore, so the interface just falls apart, you know. Well, if you&amp;#8217;re proactive enough then stuff like that doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter because you can catch it before the users do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, cool. I think that just about wraps us up unless, either Brad or Dan, if you have anything to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, I think that&amp;#8217;s good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAN: Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Awesome. I&amp;#8217;m going to give a quick shout out back to our sponsors again. Thanks to WP Ninjas for sponsoring this episode and episodes to come in the future.

PIPPIN: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Apply Filters, Episode 11. Today we have a special guest, Dan Griffiths, with us, as well as our usuals, myself and my cohost Brad Touesnard.

BRAD: Hi, everyone.

PIPPIN: Dan, please say hi.

DAN: Hello.

PIPPIN: Were going to first start out by giving a quick shout out to our sponsors. WP Ninjas, the creators behind Ninja Forms, have been kind enough to sponsor this episode, and so they are the creators of Ninja Forms and a couple of other great plugins for creating contact forms, surveys, other types of things that you need to do with a form plugin, and so go check them out at NinjaForms.com or WPNinjas.com.

And with that, why dont we go ahead and jump into things? Dan, why dont you tell us a little bit about who you are, what you do, what your day-to-day schedule looks like, things like that?

DAN: Well, who I am, Im a WordPress plugin developer predominantly. I spend a lot of time working with Pippin on Easy Digital Downloads.

PIPPIN: Yeah. Dan has been an active contributor to that project for a while now.

DAN: Nine months now?

PIPPIN: Since -- I looked at it. I think it was either February or November of last year, something like that.

DAN: Since like February. I cant remember. Oh, no. You know what it was? It was March was when that commit got in the --

PIPPIN: Yeah, so its been a while. Aside from that, what else do you do?

DAN: Aside from that, Im the founder of a project called Redux Framework. And what Redux is, it is a theme and plugin options framework for WordPress. Basically its designed to allow developers of plugins or themes to easily create a full-scale options panel for their plugin with basically minimal coding on their part, kind of similar to like Options Tree and stuff like that.

PIPPIN: Sure.

DAN: But weve kind of gone a different route and tried to make it a lot simpler for the user and a lot more flexible.

PIPPIN: Cool. So its really for implement, like creating a settings screen, a really advanced setting screen in a plugin or a theme that then gets either distributed on, say, WordPress.org or Theme Force or CodeCanyon, something like that.

DAN: Yes, and we actually have kind of gone out of our way to make sure that were maintaining compatibility with both of their licensing models so it is --

PIPPIN: Thats awesome.

DAN: Yeah.

BRAD: Hmm.

PIPPIN: Brad, have you ever used Redux?

BRAD: No. I have never even heard of it. Well, I had really no reason to look for this kind of solution.

PIPPIN: Well, you dont do a whole lot with setting screens. I mean, Ive seen your setting --

BRAD: Yeah, exactly.

PIPPIN: -- on WP Migrate DB Pro. Its like three fields.

BRAD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.

DAN: You would not be my target audience.

BRAD: Yeah, exactly. Oh, I see. So this works for plugins as well as themes.

PIPPIN: Yep, and we are currently, I believe, the only one that is specifically targeting both, which is really cool. Ive used -- I know a year or two ago I used the -- Ive used both Options Tree and Options Framework from Devin Price, and I think it was specifically for themes.

DAN: Mm-hmm.

PIPPIN: Which works well, and is really cool, but I do love the idea that youre targeting both because, when you really get down to the technical aspects, theres not really anything different.

&lt;p&gt;BRAD:  	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  I’m your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Hey, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Today, we are going to be talking all about Git, and branches, and pull requests, and all that good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure thing, so a quick introduction to Git.  For anybody who is not aware, Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code base and manage those changes in a mostly sane manner.  It is a tool that, if you’re not familiar with it, you should absolutely go learn it.  You may be familiar with something like SVN or other version control systems that are kind of similar.  But I think every serious developer should absolutely be learning version control.  And, personally, I think you should be learning Git &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; because Git is pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:  	Anyone that’s been around for a while, like developing for, you know, ten-plus years, you’re probably familiar with CVS, and then SVN was kind of the successor to CVS.  You know SourceForce, like the big repo (repository)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think they started on CVS and then switched to SVN at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And I’ve even used Visual SourceSafe, which is a Microsoft product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That’s one I have never used.  Granted, I don’t tend to use any of the Microsoft programming tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And then there’s another one I’ve used: Perforce.  It’s pretty big with kind of like enterprise stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I’ve heard of that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, they’ve been around for quite a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But Git is the new kid on the block, and it is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  For anybody, if you’re not familiar with Git, go to GitHub.  Basically GitHub, which you’ve probably heard of, is like a social code repository, and it is all based on Git.  So if you do anything in GitHub, you’re working in Git.  So even if you’re not super familiar with version control or interested in version control, being able to use GitHub is a pretty darn good reason to learn it because GitHub is awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a couple of things that we want to talk about with Git and managing your projects, and those are learning how to manage branches, so using Git branches for release management, bug fixes, new features et cetera.  I’m going to tell you a little bit about my work flow, and then, Brad, if you want to weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So when I build a new version, let’s just use Easy Digital Downloads for this example.  I do everything in branches, and my whole team does everything in branches.  Right now we’re getting ready to push out a new release for Easy Digital Downloads Version 1.9.  This release has been in development for the last six months, five months, three months, whatever, however long we’ve been working on it.  And so we’re been building everything in a branch.  And so we call it Release 1.9 is the name of our branch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we do everything in this branch, and by having this in a separate branch, we can actually do development on another version, or do minor bug fixes to the current version simultaneously.  So we have all of our code for 1.9 in this branch.  We have all of our code for 2.0 in another branch.  And then we have a code for &amp;#8212; let’s say we have a quick security fall that we need to push out an update for, we have our latest stable code in another branch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, if we have a new feature that we’re introducing, we’ll create what’s called a feature branch, and so we’ll have this branch called &amp;#8220;features/view order details&amp;#8221; or something like that.  And we’ll do all of our coding in that feature branch for that new particular feature.  And while we’re doing that, any development that’s going on to fix other bugs, or other unrelated features is happening in different branches.  So all of our development is happening simultaneously, but independent from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  So that feature branch, when it’s, like say you’ve gotten it to a point where you’re like, &amp;#8220;You know what?  I think it’s ready.  I think it could go in the next release,&amp;#8221; do you then merge that into the release branch for testing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yes.  So we’ll have our release.  We&amp;#8217;ll just call it Release 1.9, and then we have a feature branch called “view order details”.  As soon as &amp;#8220;view order details&amp;#8221; is complete, we’ll merge it into Release 1.9.  At any given time, in the EDD workflow, we have at least three branches.  We have our master branch, which is considered the latest stable version.  Basically that’s the version that everyone out in the world is using right now, plus maybe a couple minor bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	We then have the next major release, so Release 1.9, and then we have a feature branch.  So the feature branch gets completed; it gets merged into 1.9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	As soon as 1.9 is ready to go out, it gets merged into master and gets pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  So I’m going to guess that the reason that you use a feature branch, instead of just working right in the 1.9 branch, is because: what if that 1.9 is ready to go, but you haven’t finished the feature yet?  Maybe the feature needs to go in 1.9.1 or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a huge reason.  We have features that &amp;#8212; there was an API that I was working on.  It was going to be a webhook API.  So if you’re familiar with Stripe or PayPal, or any other payment system, you know that they have these things called webhooks.  Basically, when something happens, they send a remote http request to a URL with a payload, some postdata.  And so we were going to build the same kind of API.  So any time something happens with a payment &amp;#8212; let’s say a payment is completed, a payment is refunded, or something like that &amp;#8212; we could send a webhook to some URL.  So I was building an API to do that, and I was planning to release it with 1.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got about half way through the feature and then realized I’m not going to do this.  I decided to not do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	At least not at that time.  So if I had been building that directly into our 1.9 branch, that would have been a real pain in the ass to rip it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But because I had it in a feature branch, I could literally just let it sit there and nothing’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Yeah, I mean you’ve pretty much described the exact same system that we were using in our development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it’s good to know that other people are working the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Has it worked out well for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	To be honest, we’ve kind of just settled on this now.  We were doing some other things previously.  We were just kind of using &amp;#8212; we would do branches and then pull requests.  So it was a similar system, but now we’re not using pull requests any more.  So what we would do &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So when you say pull requests, do you mean for people, third party developers to submit patches, or do you mean for your own internal development…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Own internal development.  So any time I had done, basically a set of commits, any set of commits, even if it was just one commit, I would open a pull request and assign it to another developer in the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So that someone else reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And someone else would review it, and then they would merge it and, you know, fold it into kind of the main branch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But what we’ve realized is that it’s kind of excessive because, every time you a create a pull request, it creates like another, basically another GitHub issue with its own set of comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And so you have this kind of parallelism going on where you have an issue in your issue tracker, that describes the issue &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then you have a pull request that also describes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  And then your conversation is fragmented between the two.  So we decided just to use issues and just better communication within the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, we have the same issue with EDD development.  So I don’t ever do pull requests for code changes.  I used to.  I used to do the same thing that you do, basically, at least for major changes.  But some of the other developers will still do pull request.  Most of the time it’s because they don’t have full commit access to the repository, or because they’re not sure if something should go in as-is yet.  So they’ll submit a pull request.  And it does create that fragmentation, and it can be a little irritating, or confusing, or any other adjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So I definitely get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It’s also, if you think about it, if your developer, whether it’s you and one other person or you and ten other people, if you all have access to read and write to the repository, like there’s really no reason for pull requests for code review because you can still test it inside of its original branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	There’s no reason it has to be in a pull request by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, exactly, and that’s what we realized is that the pull request was just adding unnecessary overhead and management that we didn’t need.  So we’re just using, you know, GitHub issues, and we’ll just like, you know, use an @, like I&amp;#8217;d go @pippin to reference you in a comment and ask you to review it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Say, &amp;#8220;Review my code.  Tell me what I broke.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  Exactly.  So, yeah, it works quite well.  So I think we’ve kind of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I think another, for anybody who&amp;#8217;s not yet familiar with branches, or you&amp;#8217;re not sure if you should use them, I want to give you a scenario that I ran into a couple of time before I started avidly using branches for everything.  I mean, I will use branches for every single piece of development I do now.  Aside from, like, minor bug fixes, even if it’s a little, tiny feature, I will use a feature branch for it.  And it’s because I had an issue one time, or not just one time, this definitely happened at least four or five times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a new version that I was ready to push out or getting close to being ready to push out.  And then I realized, oh, this feature is not complete, but this feature is in my code base already.  I can’t push out a not-ready-to-go feature, but I also can’t rip it out very easily.  So you’re kind of stuck with: do you delay a release for, say, five days, two weeks, whatever to finish the feature, or do you work to backtrack and take it out?  And if you have everything in feature branches and release branches, that problem goes away completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue, and this is something that I ran into the other day, is let’s say that you’re working on a new release, and so you’ve got a whole bunch of new features you’ve put in.  You&amp;#8217;ve got bug fixes, et cetera.  And then, all of a sudden, you have a major bug report, something that has to go out today or tomorrow.  You have to fix it.  It’s an urgent fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, your release is two weeks away, so do you ignore that urgent bug and wait two weeks, or do you go and push out a fix?  Well, hopefully you push out a fix right away.  But if you have your not-ready-to-go code yet in your main branch, and you don’t have a way to separate it, you’re kind of stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm, yeah.  I mean that’s exactly the kind of issue we’re trying to solve as well.  So the policy &amp;#8212; I wrote a document and shared it with the team to say, you know, like, &amp;#8220;This is the policy.&amp;#8221;  And what I’ve said is, &amp;#8220;You have to be absolutely certain that this is going in this release if you’re going to merge it into that release branch.  You have to be completely confident that it’s going in,&amp;#8221; because otherwise you’re just wasting time because, if we have to rip it out, it’s a huge pain.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And a bunch of time that we don’t need to waste.  So, yeah, it’s really interesting that we&amp;#8217;re both &amp;#8212; we’ve never talked about this before and we’re using the same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, I think it’s a methodology that a lot of people use, and it’s one that has become more tried and true.  I definitely didn’t come up with it on my own.  I know there are a couple of people that influenced my decision to move to that method.  And when I first did, I was actually against it because I decided it was more complicated and was unnecessary.  And now that I’ve been using it for six to eight months, there’s no way I&amp;#8217;d ever go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Did you &amp;#8212; I mean, you came from an SVN background, right, subversion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Kind of.  I learned version control &amp;#8212; my first introduction to version control was SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I really learned version control with Git.  The only thing that I did with SVN was simply committing plugins to the repository, which, if you’ve ever done that, you know that you don’t necessarily truly need to understand SVN to submit a plugin to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	All you need to know is how to follow the guide to make a commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.  It’s funny though because SVN, you know, you kind of shy away from branching in SVN because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It&amp;#8217;s a real &amp;#8212; and painful.  It can be very painful.  But with Git, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;ve never even tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; you know, you see this, you know, if you read a few articles on Git, it’s rare that you wouldn&amp;#8217;t see the phrase, &amp;#8220;Branches are cheap with Git,&amp;#8221; because they are.  You create them.  You merge them.  You delete them like all day long.  Right?  And it’s not hard, and it’s not painful like it has been in the past with other version control systems.  So yeah, I think probably a lot of people could probably use branches a little bit better if they’ve come from a previous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Certainly.  With branches, do you want to talk a little bit about merging?  Merging is something that I think can definitely discourage a lot of people because sometimes merging can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Like resolving merge conflicts.  The first time that I saw a merge conflict, I kind of like threw up my arms like, oh, I have no clue what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	How do I fix this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What are your experiences with merging feature branches and release branches and things like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I mean &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Do you have any certain methodology for how you do it to ensure that it has a good merge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, so I use a visual tool.  I don’t know why, but I find editing, like the kind of, just the text file, and like trying to figure out stuff that way, I find a lot more difficult than using just a visual.  So, I don’t know if you’ve ever used this.  There’s an app called Versions App.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I haven’t used it.  I’ve seen it though.  I used to use one called….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, sorry, not &amp;#8212; yeah, not Version.  It&amp;#8217;s Kaleidoscope I’m thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, no.  I&amp;#8217;ve never used Kaleidoscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I think they’re made by the same company.  Anyhow, Kaleidoscope is a diff tool and a visual merge tool.  So it allows you to, you know, see the changes between the two files, and also see exactly what the conflicts are, and just simply choose which one you want from the left or the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That&amp;#8217;s cool.  That’s definitely easier than managing it through a text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, yeah.  I find, especially if you end up with kind of a hairy merge, or one that’s complicated, I find the diff tool is essential because it could save you a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  So do you have a certain methodology for merging branches that helps avoid conflicts?  I got one put together &amp;#8212; and by methodology, I just mean like a certain way that you &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	&amp;#8211; do your merges when you merge, et cetera.  And so what did you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, usually we &amp;#8212; I always say you should keep your branch, like if you’re working on a feature branch that was based on a certain release, so say &amp;#8212; let’s use concrete examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So say we’ve got a Release 1.9 branch, and feature X branch, and I’ve created the feature X branch using the Release 1.9.  But I’m working on feature X.  And then, while I’m working on it, you know, people are adding bug fixes, et cetera, to Release 1.9, and probably folding in other code into it.  While that’s happening, I should always be updating my feature X branch, merging from 1.9 into feature X to keep it as up to date as possible while I’m developing feature X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Great.  That is exactly the same thing that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  And that really prevents conflicts.  I think, if you don’t do that, you’re going to end up with conflicts.  Every once in a while, you might end up with a conflict, but it will just be a small one, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Instead of massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I know, when I first started doing feature branches, I didn’t realize that I needed to be updating my feature and release branches consistently.  And I remember I tried to merge in a feature that had been in development for like two or three months.  And it just, like, died totally.  I broke down in tears practically.  It just was like, no, there&amp;#8217;s no way this is going to merge in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, once I realized that if you keep the feature branch or the release branch up to date with whatever you’re going to merge it into, it’ll merge cleanly almost every single time at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And so then the only conflicts that you end up having to take care of is when &amp;#8212; let’s say that you&amp;#8217;re merging master into Release 1.9 to get Release 1.9 up to date.  Generally, you’ll only have really, really small conflicts because there have been very minimal changes.  So then you get those minimal conflicts taken care of, so then when you merge the 10,000-line Release 1.9 into master, all of those work perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Exactly.  They’re already resolved; you’ve already dealt with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I found it to work really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	What about tagging?  Or do we want to&amp;#8211;?  How about, before we go to tagging, you know, take a quick break.  I guess we forgot to talk about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, sure thing.  I just launched the affiliate program, so I was working on that for Migrate &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	For WP Migrate DB Pro?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, I was working on that a little bit.  But, you know, I haven’t been doing a ton of work over the break.  I’ve tried to, you know, keep it light.  Just today though I started, you know, doing a little bit of learning because I feel like I haven’t been learning very much, and I’ve just been looking at Backbone.js.  And I was looking at the Slim framework.  I was looking at all kinds of stuff.  Have you heard of Render?  It&amp;#8217;s a Node.js, Backbone.js kind of framework that Airbnb has released has released recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:  	It’s very cool because it allows you to use Backbone on the server side, as well as the client side, so you don’t have to duplicate all your views.  So it allows Node.js to serve up like a full Web page, like a fully rendered Web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That’s cool&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Which you couldn’t do before.  I don’t know if you noticed this, but you know on Twitter, like when you load a Twitter page, it kind of jumps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Like it loads all the stuff, like all the assets, and then it loads the interface.   Well, it kind of takes care of that kind of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; yeah, it&amp;#8217;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I always love learning about new tools or libraries, whatever they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s a nice break.  Even if you don’t end up using them, just being able to play with something new that is perhaps completely unrelated to, like, your day-to-day work, it&amp;#8217;s really refreshing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, totally.  I like learning about that stuff, but I often don’t play with it too much because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t know, I just never &amp;#8212; I feel like if I commit to it and then something else comes along and someone, you know, and then that thing takes a backseat or it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You know what I mean?  Like it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	For me, there are things I really like learning about, though won’t necessarily use them in a real application unless I decide to change gears and start working in that particular system or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I even feel like Node.js is still very early to be using in a production app.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	But, you know, lots of &amp;#8212; you know, Airbnb is using it heavily, so I don&amp;#8217;t know.  It might be mature enough now.  I don’t know.  What have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, I’ve been working on the same thing that I&amp;#8217;ve been doing for the last two months or so, which is EDD 1.9, getting it up to date.  We’re pushing out the final release for 1.9 on Wednesday, so that’s been a big thing.  It’s the largest release I’ve ever done, aside from like a 1.0.  We have 112 bugs and enhancements in this version that are logged on GitHub at least, so it’s pretty large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then the other thing that I’ve been working on, which I&amp;#8217;m sure I will talk about in future episodes more is, I decided to start writing an affiliate plugin just for simple affiliate tracking, referrals, et cetera, because I really have never been happy with any of the current solutions out there.  So I decided to start writing my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, that’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s called affiliatewp.com.  It hasn’t gone very far yet.  I’ve only written a few of the classes for the plugin, but it&amp;#8217;s kind of my side project just to have something else to work on and eventually get released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I feel like every time I have an opportunity to use your stuff, it’s always like, I&amp;#8217;m always like just a little bit too far ahead of where you are starting out.  It’s like when I started building my site for Migrate DB Pro; EDD didn’t quite have the maturity like some of the add-ons &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure, it was still really new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It was really new, and so I wasn’t really comfortable using it at that point.  And then I had just set up Affiliate program, and you&amp;#8217;re starting to build a plugin.  It&amp;#8217;s like, ugh, one of these days it&amp;#8217;s all going to line up &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	See, one of these days you&amp;#8217;ll realize that what I’m actually doing is just watching to see what Brad Touesnard is working on and decide to build whatever he’s using.  That’s my development methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, nice.  Well, I guess we’ll never &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	You will never get to use it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m sure I will.  I’m sure I’ll be moving to EDD before long.  But &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, that&amp;#8217;s cool.  Well, I&amp;#8217;ll be here if you ever decide to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Should we jump back into Git?  I know we&amp;#8217;ve got a couple more things to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Let&amp;#8217;s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.  How about tagging?  Do you tag all of your releases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Even the betas, actually.  And I think &amp;#8212; I can&amp;#8217;t really &amp;#8212; I guess the reason I do that is just to have kind of a record of here’s the commit &amp;#8212;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	&amp;#8211; where we stopped and released something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I have, I think I have two big reasons to do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	One is that so that you have that snapshot of Version 1.8.5 or 1.8.7 or whatever the version number is.  Two, it’s also kind of cool because GitHub does releases now, like, tracks your releases as tags.  So you can actually go in and see all of your releases, which is pretty cool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I like that a lot.  So for example, if I go into EDD, we have 56 releases on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which it&amp;#8217;s a really nice way of just quickly seeing: how many versions have we pushed out over time?  In terms of the snapshot, the snapshot is super important for, like, if you want to compare something.  Like, let’s say you want to know what changed between 1.8.7 and 1.8.6.  Maybe you introduced a bug, and you’re not sure where it is, so you want to just go and create a diff for the two versions.  You can do that with tagging.  There’s other ways to do it too, but I think that tagging is probably one of the easier ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Tagging is also important for people that are using your Git repo in their project as a sub-module.  So for instance, I’m using WordPress as a sub-module for deliciousbrains.com.  And when I update, I just do, you know, a Git update, just Git pull, and then the version number or, well, the tag name, I guess.  So depending on what it is, if it&amp;#8217;s V 3.9 or whatever, I would just do that, and it just updates from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And I also do it for other projects as well.  I think I have WooCommerce as a sub-module and a couple others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I learned a new trick yesterday that I had never used before.  Have you ever used the &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217; say that you &amp;#8212; okay, let me tell you the scenario first.  We had released EDD 1.8.5, and we we&amp;#8217;ve been working on 1.8.9, and I realized that we had a bug that we needed fixed right now.  So we had to push out an immediate update it, for 1.8.6.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that I had not tagged 1.8.5, which was kind of a: “Crap! What do I do? Like, how do I go back to 1.8.5 and apply my fix?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, previously I always thought you couldn’t do that.  I thought you had to have a tag.  That’s not true at all.  It turns out you can actually check out a specific commit number, and it will take you back to the code base at that time of the commit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm, yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I had no idea you could do that! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I thought that was so &amp;#8212; that was like &amp;#8212; that was like a revelation to me.  So I went back and found my commit where, like, my version bump, which is always the last commit of a release.  And I was like, all right, check out whatever that version, that commit number is, and voila, I have 1.8.5!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Nice.  I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure also &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	That was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m pretty the Git tag command also will allow you to input a hash, the commit hash, so that you can actually tag any commit in your history.  I’m pretty sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, I didn’t know that.  Oh, that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I’m pretty sure that’s the case, but I’m not 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So check the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, so then it was nice because then I could go back and actually retag 1.8.5, so then I actually had an official tag for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And then, in that same instance, so we needed to push out this fix for 1.8.6.  We had already fixed the bug in 1.9, and I really didn’t want to manually apply my patch.  I didn’t want to have to generate a patch or apply that, or even manually just change the code in 1.8.6.  Have you ever used the cherry pick command?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, yeah, yeah.  Cherry pick is a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, man!  It is so awesome!  It was the first time I’d ever used cherry pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But it was so cool.  So I had 1.8.5, and I had that snapshot, and then I had this commit that’s technically in the future from 1.8.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	I&amp;#8217;m like, I want to just bring this back.  I want to retroactively apply this.  And so, like, Git cherry pick and then the commit number, and it just puts in the patch.  I guess it’s really just like applying a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Mm-hmm, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But I had never used that before, and that was so cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I mean, the alternative would be to, like, copy your changes manually, right, which would be really annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, there&amp;#8217;s two main ways.  You could copy the changes manually, which I have done before, which I always feel really dirty doing it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Well, it&amp;#8217;s….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	It&amp;#8217;s like … version control system that I know should be able to handle this, yet somehow I&amp;#8217;m still copying, I&amp;#8217;m like copy and pasting between diff files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	It can result in conflicts, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	If you do that, so it&amp;#8217;s bad from that perspective as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	And I guess the other way then would be to generate an actual patch file from your commit and then apply that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But cherry pick was way cooler, and way better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So that was a new one for me that I really enjoyed working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.  Have you ever used Git add, and then -P?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Git add -P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  I bet you you&amp;#8217;ve seen the video on that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I&amp;#8217;m not sure I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	From a guy named John Kary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Okay.  If you go look it up, John Kary recorded a video that is called: The most powerful Git feature you&amp;#8217;re not using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  I learned about it.  He&amp;#8217;s my old roommate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Oh, is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Uh-huh.  This video went viral on Hacker News and a couple other places.  It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic video.  If anybody who is not familiar with Git add -P, go search for this video, and you&amp;#8217;ll find it.  Yeah, he&amp;#8217;s my old roommate.  He&amp;#8217;s actually the one that taught me Php to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  I&amp;#8217;ll give a little, just a little summary of what it is just so people might &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	So it allows you &amp;#8212; so Git add just adds, you know, an entire file or all the files in a directory or whatever you&amp;#8217;re referencing.  But Git add P will allow you to select which lines that have changed or which changes in a file you want to include in your commit.  So for example, you could, you know, leave out &amp;#8212; maybe you deleted a line from the file as kind of a cleanup, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t related to the other commits in the file or the other changes in the file.  And so you could split those into two commits just doing Git add P and doing two separate commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah.  It&amp;#8217;s super cool.  I like using it a lot for &amp;#8212; you get into the zone.  You&amp;#8217;re writing something.  You&amp;#8217;re writing a feature, or you&amp;#8217;re writing a bug fix, and all of a sudden you realize &amp;#8212; crud; I have changed like five different files that are unrelated to each other, and I really don&amp;#8217;t want to put them all into one commit because it would be a meaningless commit.  I mean, because the idea with commits is you really want them to be meaningful in that the only changes in a commit are the ones that are directly related to that fix or that improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	But suddenly you just get into the zone, and you&amp;#8217;re writing code.  You&amp;#8217;re doing whatever.  And suddenly you&amp;#8217;re like, crap, I haven&amp;#8217;t committed anything.  So you can use Git add -P and go select the exact changes that you want to put in your commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	So cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	You&amp;#8217;ve got to like, you know, it&amp;#8217;s for your own benefit to split out those commits because later on, if you&amp;#8217;re going through your commit log and you see this one giant commit, and the commit message is like &amp;#8220;stuff&amp;#8221; or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Stuff: awesome commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	That&amp;#8217;s not going to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Well, not just that for like commit logs, but also like go back to our previous example where we were talking about Git cherry pick.  Let&amp;#8217;s say that there&amp;#8217;s part of that commit I need.  I need to apply that somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	If I cherry pick it, or check out that commit, I&amp;#8217;m going to get all those changes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Which is another, I think, good reason why commits should always contain only relevant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Yeah.  Or another reason, since we&amp;#8217;re adding reasons, what if you&amp;#8217;re submitting for me, to me for code review, and I go there, and your commit is one commit.  It&amp;#8217;s five files, tons of changes, and the comment log is &amp;#8220;stuff&amp;#8221;.  I&amp;#8217;m going to be furious because I don&amp;#8217;t know even where to start.  I have to start line-by-line trying to figure out why you&amp;#8217;re doing any of this stuff, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And no context, so you really need to give your reviewers a break by making small commits that are concisely described in the commit log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yep.  Couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more.  And, I mean, in a multi-developer team, that&amp;#8217;s super important.  But I discover, even in my own development, like when I am the sole developer on a project, if I go back through my commit logs, I always get mad at myself when I see new changes or changes for 1.9, or this is fixing some dumb problem &amp;#8212; without meaningful commit messages, without separate commits for each change.  It drives me crazy because I can&amp;#8217;t actually accurately figure out what I did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Anything else we want to throw in about Git?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	I don&amp;#8217;t think so.  I think one thing I should mention is a diff app.  I mentioned one that&amp;#8217;s Mac only.  So if you&amp;#8217;re on Windows, you can check out a diff program called CSDiff.  It used to be awesome.  I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it still is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	And it&amp;#8217;s not like the flashiest app, but the algorithm that they use to do the diff is just really good.  Component Software is the company that makes that, so check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Nice.  I haven&amp;#8217;t used it, but if you are a Linux person, then there&amp;#8217;s one called Meld Diff Viewer.  And I have no idea if it&amp;#8217;s good or bad.  It has a lot of really great ratings on it, so that&amp;#8217;s something to check out if you&amp;#8217;re a Linux user and you want a graphical app to use as opposed to just a command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Should we wrap it up?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN:	Yeah, I think that pretty much does it for us.  If anybody has any questions about Git, tagging, branches, merging, cherry pick, you have other tips you want to share, feel free to leave them in the comments.  Thanks, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD:	Thanks, everybody.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

BRAD:  	Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development.  I’m your host, Brad Touesnard, and joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.

PIPPIN:	Hey, everybody.

BRAD:	Today, we are going to be talking all about Git, and branches, and pull requests, and all that good stuff.

PIPPIN:	Sure thing, so a quick introduction to Git.  For anybody who is not aware, Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code base and manage those changes in a mostly sane manner.  It is a tool that, if you’re not familiar with it, you should absolutely go learn it.  You may be familiar with something like SVN or other version control systems that are kind of similar.  But I think every serious developer should absolutely be learning version control.  And, personally, I think you should be learning Git --

BRAD:	Yeah.

PIPPIN:	-- because Git is pretty awesome.

BRAD:  	Anyone that’s been around for a while, like developing for, you know, ten-plus years, you’re probably familiar with CVS, and then SVN was kind of the successor to CVS.  You know SourceForce, like the big repo (repository)?

PIPPIN:	Yes.

BRAD:	I think they started on CVS and then switched to SVN at some point.

PIPPIN:	That’s cool.

BRAD:	And I’ve even used Visual SourceSafe, which is a Microsoft product.

PIPPIN:	That’s one I have never used.  Granted, I don’t tend to use any of the Microsoft programming tools.

BRAD:	Yeah.  And then there’s another one I’ve used: Perforce.  It’s pretty big with kind of like enterprise stuff.

PIPPIN:	I’ve heard of that one.

BRAD:	Yeah, they’ve been around for quite a while. 

PIPPIN:	Cool.

BRAD:	But Git is the new kid on the block, and it is awesome.

PIPPIN:	Yeah.  For anybody, if you’re not familiar with Git, go to GitHub.  Basically GitHub, which you’ve probably heard of, is like a social code repository, and it is all based on Git.  So if you do anything in GitHub, you’re working in Git.  So even if you’re not super familiar with version control or interested in version control, being able to use GitHub is a pretty darn good reason to learn it because GitHub is awesome. 

There’s a couple of things that we want to talk about with Git and managing your projects, and those are learning how to manage branches, so using Git branches for release management, bug fixes, new features et cetera.  I’m going to tell you a little bit about my work flow, and then, Brad, if you want to weigh in.

BRAD:	Sure.

PIPPIN:	So when I build a new version, let’s just use Easy Digital Downloads for this example.  I do everything in branches, and my whole team does everything in branches.  Right now we’re getting ready to push out a new release for Easy Digital Downloads Version 1.9.  This release has been in development for the last six months, five months, three months, whatever, however long we’ve been working on it.  And so we’re been building everything in a branch.  And so we call it Release 1.9 is the name of our branch. 

And so we do everything in this branch, and by having this in a separate branch, we can actually do development on another version, or do minor bug fixes to t</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;"&gt;BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. I&amp;#8217;m your host, Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hey, everyone. Today, before we get started, we want to welcome our sponsors for this episode. Ninja Forms were kind enough to sponsor the episode. Ninja Forms is a WordPress plug-in for creating forms in your site: contact forms, survey forms, newsletter signups, et cetera. It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic plug-in with very active development. You can find them at ninjaforms.com or wpninjas.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: We&amp;#8217;re using it on the Apply Filters site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We are. It works really, really well. We&amp;#8217;re using it for our little newsletter signup in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But it does much more powerful things than that. It can do much more advanced forms, so I highly suggest checking it out. Also, if you&amp;#8217;re a developer interested in an OpenSource project, it&amp;#8217;s a really good one to contribute to. They&amp;#8217;re very active &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s a lot of active development on their profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool. So it&amp;#8217;s a free plug-in, but there are add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. It&amp;#8217;s a free plug-in that has some pay extensions for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty sweet plug-in. I like it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Should we jump into our first topic about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Go for it, Brad. Take us away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: All right. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve just been replying to feedback for the 1.3 launch of WP Migrate DB Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what was in that launch? Was that your new media files add-on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s right, media files add-on, and you could filter post types out of migrations now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So if I wanted to do a migration of only my attachment post type, I can do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yep, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That is cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;s the little things that add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I suspect that wasn&amp;#8217;t really that little of a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It wasn&amp;#8217;t too bad actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It was mostly UI change, to be honest, so it wasn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8212; and we just copied the table filter in UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When you&amp;#8217;re doing that as well, so let&amp;#8217;s say that I want to get just the post post-type, so I don&amp;#8217;t want pages. I don&amp;#8217;t want attachments. I just want post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When you do that, and let&amp;#8217;s say that you&amp;#8217;re also pulling over the comments database, would it only pull comments related to posts, or if you had another post-type that had comments enabled on it, it would have pulled those too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: True. It does now. During our beta phase, we identified that as a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how far you went with it because I think it would have been very easy to just be like, you know what? This only applies to the post table and the post meta table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. No, that was something we identified and then we were like, you know what? It definitely shouldn&amp;#8217;t migrate comments that are attached to those posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, that&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, we exclude those, which I think makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What else? You said that you were replying to some feedback. What kind of feedback were you getting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, we changed our pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Was this related to the &amp;#8212; oh, a pricing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: We changed the pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Feedback on pricing can be terrifying sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I was a little nervous about it, but overall we got a lot of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Overall, it came out pretty well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Did it, overall, come out pretty well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think, yeah, it was mostly positive. There was a little confusion. That was the main source of negativity. A lot of people misunderstood, so I think I just didn&amp;#8217;t do a great job of communicating exactly what had changed, so I think that was probably the biggest problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Well, I think that&amp;#8217;s really easy to do, I mean, especially when you&amp;#8217;re so close to a product. It can be very easy to be like &amp;#8212; to think that the licensing, the terms, et cetera are all very, very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But it turns out, from a customer&amp;#8217;s perspective, they&amp;#8217;re maybe not quite so clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve definitely seen a lot of questions like that where, the first time I read the question, I just kind of shake my head like why didn&amp;#8217;t you realize that. And then I have to kind of step back and think, well, maybe there&amp;#8217;s something that I&amp;#8217;m missing that isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and I think that the other thing is that, you know, we&amp;#8217;re so early in the buying of plug-ins, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It&amp;#8217;s not like people have been buying plug-ins for, you know, ten years at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, and I think part of being so early in that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of different ways that plug-ins are being sold right now, a lot of different terms, licensing, et cetera. And so there&amp;#8217;s not a consistent experience for users. So sometimes they&amp;#8217;re buying something forever. Sometimes they&amp;#8217;re buying it for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sometimes they&amp;#8217;re really just buying access to support. I mean, some people are really good about being clear on what&amp;#8217;s being purchased. Some are not. So that&amp;#8217;s definitely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A lot of it, it just comes down to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and that&amp;#8217;s what &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Education and presentation of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And that&amp;#8217;s pretty much why I&amp;#8217;ve been furiously responding to emails for the last couple days, so that&amp;#8217;s kind of what it comes down to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, but what have you been working on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, right now we&amp;#8217;ve been &amp;#8212; I have a big push from now until January, over the last couple months to get the next version of Easy Digital Downloads out, which is 1.9. And it&amp;#8217;s had a lot of improvements. I think the last three episodes of Apply Filters have all talked about some enhancement or something that I&amp;#8217;ve been working on for it. Like last time I&amp;#8217;d been working on a graphing class to allow you to build a graphing &amp;#8212; to basically provide a piece of data and then have it graphed for you. So that&amp;#8217;s now done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I was moving on to doing some general bug fixes, and I ran into a doozy. And it ended up consuming about four hours of my life last night. And so I have this bug where we have a setting, we have our setting screen, and we have a tab screen, so some of the settings are displayed on each screen. All of these settings are stored in just one option in the database as one big array. And it just uses the standard WordPress settings API. There&amp;#8217;s nothing special about it. I mean, there&amp;#8217;s nothing abnormal. There&amp;#8217;s not a lot of custom code in there in terms of house settings are stored or sanitized and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, we discovered this bug when another developer was building an extension where, if you pull the options from the database using just, say, like the get option call, and then so you have one big array of options, and then you change one value. So let&amp;#8217;s say you change the value of some key or other. And then you pass it back through update option, which is a very standard practice, it actually wipes out all of the settings for the plug-in. And so instead of just updating that one value, every single value gets &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s just gone. It obliterates them. And I have not, for the life of me, been able to figure it out yet. And it&amp;#8217;s really, really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So every option in the options table just gets set to empty screen. Is that what you mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, no, no, no, sorry, so only our one option. So we have one option called EDD settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is an array of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A value pair. And when you run EDD settings through update option, after you&amp;#8217;ve changed that one value, it just gives it a blank array, basically, instead of giving it its normal array of values. So it doesn&amp;#8217;t actually save it. So at some point during the save process, it&amp;#8217;s interpreting; it&amp;#8217;s perceiving the data to be incorrect and just giving it a blank array instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Ah. Did you end up fixing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so then all of EDD settings option is just gone. No, I haven&amp;#8217;t fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It turned into a rabbit hole, and I haven&amp;#8217;t found my way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And I&amp;#8217;m guessing you already dug into the serialization stuff to see if it actually serialized properly, because that would be my first guess is the serialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I haven&amp;#8217;t looked at the serialization. That&amp;#8217;s a good idea. What I was looking at was the sanitization callback. So when you use the register setting function, it has the third parameter is a callback function to sanitize the data before it&amp;#8217;s saved. And so we had a large callback function that we had there that was looping through some data and doing some stuff with it, applying some of our own filters as well. And so I thought that was messing it up because we actually did have one place in that function where, if a value wasn&amp;#8217;t there, it would turn it into just an empty array. But it turns out that even if I disable that, it still fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which was strange, and so at that point it&amp;#8217;s like straight up WordPress Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: There&amp;#8217;s very little else in there. We have basically register setting on admin in it, and that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve never really run into an issue with serialize because the PHP serialization function is very robust. It can handle pretty much anything you throw into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But this case almost sounds like it&amp;#8217;s spitting out an empty array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It does kind of sound like one value wasn&amp;#8217;t correctly serialized, so it says, oh, this is no longer valid. We&amp;#8217;re going to return false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or whatever serialize does when it&amp;#8217;s invalid data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Well, good luck, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That is what it seems like, so anyway. So that&amp;#8217;s my rabbit hole. That&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m working on. I wish I was working on things that were much more interesting, but unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sometimes you&amp;#8217;ve just got to go down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, well, I usually &amp;#8212; almost every single release, whether it&amp;#8217;s for EDD or some other plug-in, I end up having like two or three bugs that sit there for a month or two because I just don&amp;#8217;t want to attack them. Unfortunately, we&amp;#8217;re like three weeks from the deadline for the release, so I have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So anyway, shall we jump onto our next topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. This is actually a listener question, and I can actually pronounce this because I can speak French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: His name is Luke Pransurn. I&amp;#8217;m hoping it&amp;#8217;s French because, if not, I really butchered that. And he asks what do you guys use to deploy WordPress websites. And this is a topic that comes up a lot, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, so we talk all about deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So we kind of broke this down into a couple different sections, so we&amp;#8217;ll talk first about deploying the code, and then talk about deploying the database, and then go into some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And I think we&amp;#8217;ll have to be pretty brief on most of these, so we probably won&amp;#8217;t get too in depth with them. It&amp;#8217;ll be a lot of just kind of mentioning here&amp;#8217;s a quick overview of what they do, simply due to time constraints. And there&amp;#8217;s a lot of different ones here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So if any is interested in going more in depth with any of these, feel free to email us, post a comment to show notes, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And we&amp;#8217;ll link everything up that we&amp;#8217;re talking about here in the show notes with, you know, a little bit extra information and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what&amp;#8217;s the first one for deploying code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Good old FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You know what? It still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It does. And it&amp;#8217;s the most reliable, I would say, in terms of availability, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, in terms of availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Like it&amp;#8217;s almost always available. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. If you don&amp;#8217;t have FTP on your host then get a new host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, there&amp;#8217;s something wrong. Although, you know what? A lot of hosts, like managed hosts, don&amp;#8217;t provide that. I don&amp;#8217;t think WP Engine provided it in the very beginning, did they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know, you know, at the beginning. They do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, FTP is like, it&amp;#8217;s got to, you&amp;#8217;ve got to have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. But overall, it&amp;#8217;s really not great for deployment for some big reasons. For small sites it works really great. Larger sites, it should probably try to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and the tools matter in this case. If you don&amp;#8217;t have any other option but to use FTP, you&amp;#8217;re going to probably want to, you know, get a good tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ve used Transmit in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Transmit is really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Only available for Mac though, so if you&amp;#8217;re on Windows, you&amp;#8217;ll have to find something else. But Transmit has a synch feature that actually compares the timestamps on files, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to upload everything again, right. It&amp;#8217;ll just upload &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, that&amp;#8217;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So I&amp;#8217;ve used that in the past. And then another thing that you can do is you can use this little ruby gem called Dandelion in conjunction &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; in conjunction with &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ve heard of it, but I&amp;#8217;m not familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s a little ruby gem, so a command line tool that works in conjunction with Git, so you set your FTP credentials in a little config file, and then you just do Dandelion deploy, and it will upload the difference based on your Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So you&amp;#8217;re working in it. You&amp;#8217;re basically working in your Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And you have all your different commits. And then Dandelion will deploy those changes via FTP to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It will actually do a Git. It&amp;#8217;ll use Git to determine which files have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Does that assume that the Git repository is on the server as well, or are you just deploying to a directory on the server?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You&amp;#8217;re just deploying to a &amp;#8212; so it does the Git compare locally on your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I actually discovered it just as I was finishing up client work, and this had been a big problem for me because, oftentimes with client work, you don&amp;#8217;t have SSH access, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You have like HostGator or GoDaddy or &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; a small, standard host that your most common tool is FTP. So that would be great for those developers that are familiar with Git, that use a Git workflow, and would like a deployment system, but are working in environments where it&amp;#8217;s not available. That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, Dandelion is a savior for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s really awesome. So what about these other two that we have on here: deploy HQ and deploy.IO? Can you talk a little bit about those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ll just mention them really. I haven&amp;#8217;t used them personally. They&amp;#8217;re just services, like so SAS services that you subscribe to, and they do kind of, you know, like you enter your FTP credentials, and you give it your GitHub repository, and it kind of just magically synchs up your site. So these things are, you know, fully supported. They have documentation and support, so you can contact them for support and everything. So I just recommend just go and check out their websites. Everything is very clear there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. They look like very good services. But like I said, I haven&amp;#8217;t tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: One thing we should mention before moving on to databases is what if you do have SSH access to a server, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, certainly. Well, if you have SSH access to the server, and you are a Git developer, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of different ways that you can do deployments with Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And not requiring any kind of service or anything like that. I&amp;#8217;ve done it in a variety of ways. What I&amp;#8217;ve actually done recently with some sites, and I&amp;#8217;m sure some people will frown at this. Some of this was out of need. Some of it was just because I don&amp;#8217;t have that much experience with doing large site deployments. I was actually, instead of pushing to a server, I always pulled down to a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I actually would have my repository sitting somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Like Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Like a private GitHub repository or bit bucket or something like that. So then I would push to that, and then I could actually pull from that into my staging server or into my live server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t see any problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And that&amp;#8217;s actually the model that I &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s one that I use a lot right now with the site that I work on for CGcookie.com. We have a staging server and a live server. And then we keep everything in different branches, so we have our master branch, and we have a dev branch. And then we&amp;#8217;ll do feature branches as well for testing new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so then we just pull down from those, and that works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The advantage to it is that instead of just being able to say Git push, and everything goes live, we have to then log &amp;#8212; we have to SSH into the server, go to the repository, and then pull it down. So there&amp;#8217;s a little bit of extra steps in there, but it still works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. No, that works pretty good. I have actually set up &amp;#8212; I kind of started a while ago to kind of refining this process with an article from Joe Maller called a Web-focused Git workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I feel like I&amp;#8217;ve seen that before, but I&amp;#8217;ve never read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty much the first hit on Google when you search for Git Web workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So he kind of details how you set it up, like your basic Git push system. And I guess the golden rule is to never push to a live repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Never push to a working copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So just a &amp;#8212; I think it&amp;#8217;s called a bare repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So that&amp;#8217;s what you do. You push to this bare repository, and then you use a hook, a Git push hook to then pull from the working copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Interesting. I&amp;#8217;ve never &amp;#8212; I have not done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s a little more work to set up, but there are some serious advantages. For example, what I&amp;#8217;ve got right now when I do a Git push for DeliciousBrains.com, it actually mirrors the repository to GitHub as well. And then it updates the assets, any assets that need to go to Amazon S3. It actually uploads those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And then it also updates the files in the Webroot, so it does like all this cool stuff, and in one step, and like deploys everything in one command, you know, so it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; and it&amp;#8217;s fully customizable, right? I could do other things if I wanted to, so yeah, it&amp;#8217;s pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: The other thing that you could do with SSH access is you could just run rsynch, run rsynch command, and that would just copy the changes between, you know, your local and your remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I use that a lot for, not so much for deployments, but I use it a lot for copying over from a live server to a staging server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So like for CGcookie.com, for example, we have like 30 to 58 gigabytes worth of images. And sometimes we want to replicate everything exactly as is to our staging server. Let&amp;#8217;s just say things like FTP don&amp;#8217;t work so well for that. Rsynch works beautifully though because it takes about three seconds and you&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t even know how rsynch works, but it&amp;#8217;s almost magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have no idea how the technology works. It&amp;#8217;s cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, because &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Props to the people that created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s like it instantly knows what&amp;#8217;s changed even though, you know, like you said, there might be four gigs and thousands of files, right? It must build some kind of index and then just update it or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s really cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It still boggles my mind how good it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. Let&amp;#8217;s jump into a little bit on deploying databases as well. Like we mentioned, we&amp;#8217;re really just going to touch on some of these topics, so we&amp;#8217;re not going to get too in depth with these as well. I think the first thing that we have in deploy database, and I&amp;#8217;ll talk about these initially. Brad is pretty familiar with them. If you&amp;#8217;re deploying WordPress databases, and so let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a local development site that you&amp;#8217;ve been working on, and then you have a live one. And you have the files are the same in both places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files are the same in both places, and you just want to synch the content. So Brad has written two plug-ins called WP Migrate DB and WP Migrate DB Pro, which there is the free version, WP Migrate DB that&amp;#8217;s on WordPress.org, and then there&amp;#8217;s the Pro version on DeliciousBrains.com as well. And they&amp;#8217;re really slick because they basically allow you to take your database from one site and migrate it to another, and do all of the URL updates and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And it works really, really well for whether you&amp;#8217;re doing deployments or you&amp;#8217;re doing just testing, migrations, whatever it is that you&amp;#8217;re moving. If you need to move the database, those work really well. And I know everyone has heard us talk about them a couple times based on what you&amp;#8217;ve been working on and just past episodes and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, I guess the problems these things solve might be important to touch on because, you know, people might be wondering why don&amp;#8217;t you just use phpMyAdmin, export the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, dump the database, import it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And then import it on the other side. Well, if you&amp;#8217;ve tried that, you know that doesn&amp;#8217;t work because, first of all, the two options for a site URL and home URL need to be updated before you can even access the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, otherwise you get an error establishing database connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or a similar error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, actually you get a redirect, infinite redirect usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, that&amp;#8217;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right? Because it&amp;#8217;s trying to redirect to the URL that doesn&amp;#8217;t exist that it can&amp;#8217;t find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So those two options are pretty easy to update. But, you know, there&amp;#8217;s some bigger problems too, aside from those. Think about if you have &amp;#8212; let&amp;#8217;s say you&amp;#8217;re working locally and you&amp;#8217;ve built all of your content out, and you&amp;#8217;re ready to migrate this client site up to their live server, and you&amp;#8217;ve built all the content, which includes images and internal links and all these things. Well, if you have any links that are the full URLs and not relative links, those all have to be updated as well. So these plug-ins will go search all of your post content, your comment content, all of those places for those URLs and will update them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And then some people might be &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so that can be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and some people might be wondering, okay, well, why don&amp;#8217;t I just run a find and replace on that export file, right, or just a simple find and replace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But what happens if one of those URLs are contained in, let&amp;#8217;s say, a widget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Then….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Then the serialization breaks, right? And then you lose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep. And so these plug-ins will fix the serialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You lose those widgets if you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Another option, so for those people that do want to do things a little bit more manually, there is actually a really good script for doing a search and replace that&amp;#8217;s written specifically for WordPress databases, and it&amp;#8217;s called ‑‑ it&amp;#8217;s actually just called search and replace for WordPress databases. But it comes from a website called Interconnected, and we&amp;#8217;ll have a link in the show notes. But it&amp;#8217;s a standalone PHP script that you drop onto a server, and it allows you to do the same thing where you enter the values, the original values, and then what you want the values to be changed to. And it works exceptionally well. And when looking at database migration options, WP Migrate DB Pro and the free version and this PHP script are pretty much the same thing &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: &amp;#8212; in different forms and to different levels. But they more or less do the same things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yep. And as far as I know, they&amp;#8217;re really the only options. So if any listeners have any other ways that they handle database migrations, you should &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: If anybody has a really awesome plug-in or script for doing things like generating a staging environment with including the update to the URLs, if anybody has used WP Engine and is familiar with the way that that staging creation works, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about it because it&amp;#8217;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Definitely. I&amp;#8217;ve heard about Vagrant. Is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What is it, V?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Vagrant is pretty slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I haven&amp;#8217;t checked it out. You have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s for creating development environments. So basically you can spin up a server on your computer, and it can be any kind of server that you want. It could be a Windows server, a Linux server. And it all runs inside of a virtual machine, but it&amp;#8217;s virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: How is it better than like VMware or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The idea that you can tear down or start up a server any time you want very quickly. You can set up &amp;#8212; you can have like predefined options, so a lot of people will have like their default plug-ins. They install certain versions of WordPress, things like that. It&amp;#8217;s pretty slick. If you haven&amp;#8217;t played with it, I&amp;#8217;d suggest doing it. It&amp;#8217;s very different than a deployment system though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s for creating development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool. Should we move on and quickly touch up on backup and restore plus-ins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, so that I guess this is another option to do, like to copy a website from, you know, A to B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I would think of these as, so when we talk about deployment, I would think of deployment as primarily like deploying changes. I mean, sure, the first time I might be deploying a full website. But after that, it&amp;#8217;s mostly just changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: For these plug-ins that we&amp;#8217;re talking about, like backup and restore, is really the first time or like if you&amp;#8217;re moving a full site, things like that. It&amp;#8217;s not going to be for making small changes live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to have to do this several times a week or even a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;d be very tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So what are some of these deployments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, probably the most popular one is BackupBuddy, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, from IThemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: From IThemes, but that&amp;#8217;s a commercial only plug-in, so there is actually no free option for that. But check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It works really well though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I&amp;#8217;ll give them that. It&amp;#8217;s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. BackupBuddy is great. Check it out, ithemes.com. BackWPup is another one. They also have a commercial version, but also a free version on the .org repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think I used their free version a long time ago, but I honestly do not remember my experience with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve used any of these, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I haven&amp;#8217;t used the next ones we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Duplicator is one on a free only, actually. There&amp;#8217;s no commercial version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That one, I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about except I monitor the WordPress.org reviews forum, and it gets a lot of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And most of them are good, so statistics point to it being a good plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have not tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve also noticed several people that have, you know, become customers of Migrate DB Pro, and they&amp;#8217;ve previously been Duplicator users, and they&amp;#8217;ve moved to a different style of deployment. So it does sound also, just from that anecdotal evidence &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; that it&amp;#8217;s popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And we&amp;#8217;ve got two others for WP Clone and WordPress Move, both of which are designed for moving a site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Both are free only and available on the .org repo, so check them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Somebody should do a review of like all of these suckers in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, a comparison just to see what each can do, what the limitations are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The other one that I can really speak for much is BackupBuddy, which is really slick because it does your standard backups, but it also goes further. It gives you a file backup, a database backup. It also gives you a restore tool and a migration. So just like how we were talking about with WP Migrate DB Pro and the free version and the search and replace script, BackupBuddy has the support for migrating the database between URLs as well, for doing all the advanced search and replace. And that&amp;#8217;s something &amp;#8212; that was the first time that I had used BackupBuddy was when I needed to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, it works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I think it&amp;#8217;s pretty much, it&amp;#8217;s like the de facto standard for backups, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. They&amp;#8217;ve done a ton of work in making sure that it works on almost every single environment imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have had it fail. But to be fair, it was failing on a site that was enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A site that was so large that I don&amp;#8217;t expect anything but like a truly hosted backup solution to be able to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm. I know WP Engine forbids BackupBuddy for some. I don&amp;#8217;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They forbid it for one reason only, and it&amp;#8217;s simply that it duplicates functionality that they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So WP Engine has an automated backup system that they run, and a restore system as well. And so they don&amp;#8217;t allow BackupBuddy just because it&amp;#8217;s not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Huh. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Personally, I think it&amp;#8217;s a little unnecessary to forbid it because if I want to run duplicated backups, that&amp;#8217;s my business is kind of my personal feeling. But I don&amp;#8217;t care too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Or what if you wanted to use it to do a database migration or something, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. That&amp;#8217;d be &amp;#8212; I think, I mean, they don&amp;#8217;t forbid it in that you can&amp;#8217;t install it. You will just get an email if you have it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, really? Oh. That&amp;#8217;s not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I think &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know if they have multiple ways of doing it. If you have a forbidden plug-in, for example Broken Link Checker is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And if you have it installed, it will send you an automated email, and then it&amp;#8217;ll say like if this is not removed after one week, it&amp;#8217;ll be automatically removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You know you&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I don&amp;#8217;t know if they have like tiers for the different levels of restricted plug-ins, so like I don&amp;#8217;t know if there&amp;#8217;s plug-ins that are advised against simply because it&amp;#8217;s duplicated functionality, and then plug-ins that are actually forbidden. I&amp;#8217;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You know you&amp;#8217;re a bad ass if you&amp;#8217;re running a forbidden plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s how I gauge it. I&amp;#8217;ll admit I got caught a couple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Nice. Should we talk a little bit about deployment to the WordPress.org repo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, certainly. So like if you want to deploy a plug-in, so anybody who has written a plug-in for WordPress.org knows that you have to do it through SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Boo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: In general. I mean, because the plug-in repository is all SVN, and so you need to use SVN to get your plug in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s really not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, it&amp;#8217;s really not. The guide that shows you how to do it on WordPress.org is pretty straightforward. It can seem a little scary if you don&amp;#8217;t know what SVN is or if you&amp;#8217;re unfamiliar with it. But once you&amp;#8217;ve done it a couple times, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy. But there are some cool options if you&amp;#8217;re not an SVN user. I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re an SVN user, that&amp;#8217;s awesome. I mean, you can go to town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#8217;s say that you have your plug-ins in GitHub or in a Git repository or any other Git repository. But you don&amp;#8217;t want to maintain two different versions of your plug-in. I can tell you that I have a long list of plug-ins that I have written over the last two, three years. And a lot of them were written before I was familiar with some of these deployment methods, and so I have a GitHub version of the plug-in, and I have an SVN version of the plug-in, and I maintain both of them, which is really, really annoying and obnoxious because I have to keep both of them up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there&amp;#8217;s a couple of really cool scripts that allow you to do all of your development in Git and then, when you&amp;#8217;re ready to push out a release, it will push to the WordPress.org repository for you. Brad, have you ever used these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, I use the one from Scribu. I don&amp;#8217;t know how to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Awesome. Yeah. They&amp;#8217;re fantastic. I use the one from Brainstorm Media, which is Paul Clark. And basically you just run. It&amp;#8217;s a little SH script, a little shell script that you run. And it will create a tag of your release. It will push it to SVN and do everything needed. So you do everything in GitHub and never touch SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That sounds very similar to the Scribu scripts as well. It&amp;#8217;s just one command, like you plug-in dash deploy, and that&amp;#8217;s it. You&amp;#8217;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. I highly recommend it. I don&amp;#8217;t ever write a plug-in without them now. So every single plug-in that I do now, I mean, unless for whatever reason they&amp;#8217;re not on GitHub, which almost all of them are, we&amp;#8217;ll use these just because it makes things so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to actually dred doing plug-in updates sometimes because it was just an extra amount of tedious work saying, okay, my plug-in is in GitHub. I&amp;#8217;m going to copy over to my SVN, and I&amp;#8217;m going to do all these different things. And it was just extra work. Even though it only took a couple minutes, knowing that it&amp;#8217;s extra, unnecessary work made me not want to do it. And now I&amp;#8217;m just like, oh, make my changes, commit, deploy, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Man, all this talk about SVN being like ancient has got me thinking about how old I am because I&amp;#8217;ve used CVS before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t know what CVS is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Aside from the pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It stands for concurrent versioning system, and it was the one, the one that everyone used before SVN, and it was horrible compared to SVN. So if you think SVN is bad, oh, man, you&amp;#8217;ve got it good with Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice. Yeah, I know I was pretty late to the version control game. I never started using version control until about a year and a half ago, maybe two years ago. It was right about when I was getting serious with plug-in development was when I started to get familiar with Git mostly. I had used SVN. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve used SVN since the very first plug-in I released because I had to. But just because you use it doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean that you totally understand or appreciate what you&amp;#8217;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s just like, well, this is what I have to do to get my plug-in in there. Okay. That&amp;#8217;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think everyone that has used Git, it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, starts out at that stage, right? That&amp;#8217;s the great thing about Git. You can actually get into it pretty easily just knowing little bits and pieces. And then that gets you into trouble, and then you learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I always thought that Git was earlier to learn than SVN. But it&amp;#8217;s interesting because I actually heard a lot of people tell me the exact opposite and that I&amp;#8217;m crazy for thinking that SVN is so much easier. And I think that comes from really learning and understanding version control with Git first as opposed to SVN first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes. Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I was using SVN before I was using Git, but I didn&amp;#8217;t really have an appreciation for what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It was, Git is what made me fully understand the idea of versioning. So to me, Git is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: The whole branching thing between the two is &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: To me, it was super intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, but it&amp;#8217;s so different between Git and SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So that&amp;#8217;s, I think that&amp;#8217;s the big &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right, and I think that&amp;#8217;s where people start to say, well, Git is so much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s only, at least from my experience, it&amp;#8217;s only harder if you were previously fluent in something like SVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. And as soon as you realize, oh, Git, with Git you can just branch all the things, and &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Branch it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And it&amp;#8217;s amazing, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Because in SVN, branches are painful, so you don&amp;#8217;t want to be branching that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: As soon as people realize that, they&amp;#8217;re like, oh, my God. What was I thinking? SVN is junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, I know there&amp;#8217;s so much more that could be said about deployment. We really only touched on some of these. So again, if you have any questions or comments, feel free to drop them in the show notes, send us a message on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or any other method you feel like getting in touch with us.

Transcript:

BRAD: Welcome to Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Im your host, Brad Touesnard. And joining me, as usual, is my cohost, Pippin Williamson.

PIPPIN: Hey, everyone. Today, before we get started, we want to welcome our sponsors for this episode. Ninja Forms were kind enough to sponsor the episode. Ninja Forms is a WordPress plug-in for creating forms in your site: contact forms, survey forms, newsletter signups, et cetera. Its a fantastic plug-in with very active development. You can find them at ninjaforms.com or wpninjas.com.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: Go ahead.

BRAD: Were using it on the Apply Filters site.

PIPPIN: We are. It works really, really well. Were using it for our little newsletter signup in the sidebar.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: But it does much more powerful things than that. It can do much more advanced forms, so I highly suggest checking it out. Also, if youre a developer interested in an OpenSource project, its a really good one to contribute to. Theyre very active -- theres a lot of active development on their profile.

BRAD: Cool. So its a free plug-in, but there are add-ons.

PIPPIN: Right. Its a free plug-in that has some pay extensions for it.

BRAD: Okay. Cool.

PIPPIN: Yeah. Its a pretty sweet plug-in. I like it a lot.

BRAD: Right on.

PIPPIN: Should we jump into our first topic about what weve been working on recently?

BRAD: Sure.

PIPPIN: Go for it, Brad. Take us away.

BRAD: All right. Yeah, Ive just been replying to feedback for the 1.3 launch of WP Migrate DB Pro.

PIPPIN: So what was in that launch? Was that your new media files add-on?

BRAD: Yeah, thats right, media files add-on, and you could filter post types out of migrations now as well.

PIPPIN: So if I wanted to do a migration of only my attachment post type, I can do that?

BRAD: Yep, absolutely.

PIPPIN: Thats pretty cool.

BRAD: Yeah.

PIPPIN: That is cool.

BRAD: Yeah, so its the little things that add up.

PIPPIN: I suspect that wasnt really that little of a thing.

BRAD: It wasnt too bad actually.

PIPPIN: No?

BRAD: It was mostly UI change, to be honest, so it wasnt -- and we just copied the table filter in UI.

PIPPIN: When youre doing that as well, so lets say that I want to get just the post post-type, so I dont want pages. I dont want attachments. I just want post.

BRAD: Mm-hmm.

PIPPIN: When you do that, and lets say that youre also pulling over the comments database, would it only pull comments related to posts, or if you had another post-type that had comments enabled on it, it would have pulled those too?

BRAD: True. It does now. During our beta phase, we identified that as a bug.

PIPPIN: Okay.

BRAD: But, yeah.

PIPPIN: I wasnt sure how far you went with it because I </itunes:summary>

                    <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For Episode 8, Brad and I once again get together to discuss our latest projects and noteworthy plugins, while also extending our discussion onto the topic of unit tests in WordPress plugin development, something that all developers should consider at least becoming familiar with, even if choosing not to implement them.&lt;span id="more-84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcript:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 8 of Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. I&amp;#8217;m your host, Pippin Williamson, along with my cohost, Brad Touesnard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Hey, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Today we&amp;#8217;re going to talk, kind of do our standard format. We&amp;#8217;re going to talk a little bit about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on each, some noteworthy plugins, and then onto our main topic of Unit Test. So we&amp;#8217;ll probably go ahead and get started here with talking about what we&amp;#8217;ve been working on recently. Brad, why don&amp;#8217;t you start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. I&amp;#8217;ve actually been working on Migrate DB Pro, the plugin that I sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s kind of your standard project recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. It takes up a lot of my time. And we just released the beta 2 of version 1.3 that&amp;#8217;s coming out, well, as soon as we&amp;#8217;re out of beta, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you have a list of beta testers that you have, or do you send them out to buyers? What do you do? How do you get your beta testers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. So we kind of started like a little spreadsheet of people, basically, and then I moved that to a list in Campaign Monitor to easily, you know, tap into and send emails to. And then today, I was just like, you know what, I&amp;#8217;m just going to invite everyone to join this list. And then I added an auto responder to it that would send them the details to get started beta testing. So as soon as they sign up for the email list, they get this email that says this is how you can, you know, get started. And I don&amp;#8217;t know. It seems to be working okay, but still an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What about you? How do you do Easy Digital Downloads? How do you &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: When it comes to beta testers, it kind of depends on the plugin. Like for EDD, we usually send out to our entire mailing list, as well as like Twitter and Facebook, that we have a beta. And then we&amp;#8217;ll post about how people can get the beta, how they can test it, where to put feedback. But we don&amp;#8217;t have a list of like specific beta testers. And I think, honestly, probably the difference between a commercial plugin and a free plugin. I&amp;#8217;ve done beta tests with some of my commercial plugins before too, and I&amp;#8217;ve always done it exactly like you do where you have that list of people that you send it to, and it&amp;#8217;s much more of a closed beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I&amp;#8217;ve just opened it up today, and it&amp;#8217;s just exploding. We only had like 20 people, and now it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, 5 times that today. Well, it was, like a half hour after I sent the email, it like quadrupled in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The number of people that are beta testing or the feedback coming back from those people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, they sign up for the email list, so they&amp;#8217;re interested &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, I gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; in getting the beta, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Do you actually get; do you get a pretty good kickback on beta testers in terms of quality feedback? I&amp;#8217;ve always noticed that it&amp;#8217;s hit or miss. Like sometimes I&amp;#8217;ll send out a beta, and I&amp;#8217;ll get like dozens and dozens of pieces of feedback. And then other times I&amp;#8217;ll send out a beta and I get like one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I guess it depends like what the new features are. In this version, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of new features that people have been asking for, so they&amp;#8217;re super excited to just try it out. I think that has a lot to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I guess that makes sense because you have the new media files add-on, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly, so that&amp;#8217;s what people have been requesting a lot, so they&amp;#8217;re ‑‑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; pretty excited to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice. I hope that goes well for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. What have you been working on lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: This morning, I was primarily doing some bbPress extensions. bbPress 2.5 came out recently, which included a big new feature for like form subscriptions. So if you&amp;#8217;re familiar with bbPress, there&amp;#8217;s always been the ability to like subscribe to topics, and so you can get an email any time that somebody posts a reply to a topic that you&amp;#8217;re subscribed on. But there&amp;#8217;s never been a way for someone to subscribe to a forum to get notification any time a new topic gets posted to that forum. So that was introduced in bbPress 2.5. And so I was updating some of my bbPress extensions to take advantage of that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Are any of your bbPress expressions commercial, or is it all just open source? Free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: No, all of them are free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay. Gotcha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Most bbPress extensions that I&amp;#8217;ve done, I have about ten of them now, I think. They&amp;#8217;re almost all I built like for my own use, and not to say that that couldn&amp;#8217;t be commercialized by any means, but I just, I really like them being free extensions. And most of them are pretty small extensions too, like there&amp;#8217;s nothing; there&amp;#8217;s no major extension that would warrant a $20 or $50 plugin. And I don&amp;#8217;t really like $5 plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: They tend to cause more problems than they&amp;#8217;re worth in terms of the amount of support time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I have some old like $5 plugins, and I keep meaning to pull them off just because getting like 5 tickets a month on them is more than they generate in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, are you talking like $5, and that&amp;#8217;s it forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, yeah. Like I&amp;#8217;m talking about little widgets that are like sold on Code Canyon and places like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I can see where &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: A lot of times &amp;#8212; I had done them originally just kind of for fun. And the problem with it is really that once you have a price on it, whether you want to support it or not, you should &amp;#8212; at least I personally believe &amp;#8212; you should be obligated to help people when they have problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, yeah. Well, the expectation is definitely that you have to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. So anyway, so for these &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I gave you $0.25, then you must &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: You will help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, you must give me the world, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Like as soon as anyone opens their wallet, the expectation changes, right? It&amp;#8217;s just the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, absolutely. And I don&amp;#8217;t think that&amp;#8217;s really wrong. I think if somebody is paying you money, they should have at least some expectation of some assistance if needed. But anyway, so all of my bbPress extensions are free, so I was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then right now I&amp;#8217;m kind of working on a new API for EDD. It&amp;#8217;s a graphing API, so we have reports in the plugin that allow you to see like sales and earnings, and then those might be carried over to some extensions. So like for example, if you&amp;#8217;re recording commissions for multiple authors, then you might be able to see a report of like commissions recorded per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so these graphs that we built through these reports, they look really nice, but they&amp;#8217;re really horrible to implement. Like they&amp;#8217;re hard to build. They&amp;#8217;re kind of janky. They&amp;#8217;re not flexible, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: What are you using to build them? Are you using like a JavaScript thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re using a jQuery library called a flot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which works really well, and it looks really nice. And the implementation, like the pain points, have nothing to do with flot. It&amp;#8217;s just the way that I&amp;#8217;ve built it. I didn&amp;#8217;t build it to be flexible from day one. So what I&amp;#8217;m building is a new graphs API that will allow an extension or somebody to basically just pass an array of data: one array for one axis and another array for the other axis, like X and Y. And it will just do all the graphing for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m trying to build right now. Right now I&amp;#8217;m just kind of in the figuring out how the heck to do it, how to structure it, and then hopefully it&amp;#8217;ll be implemented some time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I&amp;#8217;ve worked a bit with flot as well and, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but it always seemed confusing or painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It took me a long time to figure out how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and just like to create, to get the data from PHP into the graph, like using flot, I have found it a little cumbersome. It&amp;#8217;s probably just because I wasn&amp;#8217;t used to it, but yeah. The code that I wrote wasn&amp;#8217;t that great either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Mine is kind of scary looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s a lot of JavaScript embedded inside of a PHP file, and it&amp;#8217;s just not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So hopefully I&amp;#8217;m going to fix that, so that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Should we jump over to our noteworthy plugins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re that noteworthy. They&amp;#8217;re just stuff that we&amp;#8217;ve worked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Yeah, we&amp;#8217;ll try and call them noteworthy this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We say that because both the plugins that we chose were our own plugins today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Why don&amp;#8217;t you go ahead and start with yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure. Mine is called Amazon S3 and CloudFront. And this is a plugin that I forked. So the plugin was originally called tantan-s3, a plugin by Joe Tan that was, I think he released it in 2009 or something. And a couple years ago, I forked it just for my own personal use, and I needed to make some changes to it, and I fixed up all the, you know, PHP notices and warnings and stuff like that. And I&amp;#8217;ve just been using it kind of behind the scenes. And then, at the beginning of this year, I cleaned it up a little bit more, and then released it on .org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So I think I need to look into using this plugin, actually. So I have a question for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So, first of all, tell me if I&amp;#8217;m right. It takes any file that you upload through the media library and copies to Amazon S3, and then any time that media library is used on the site, it pulls from S3 instead of the media library, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Exactly. Precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And it does have to go through your server though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So when you upload a file, it ends up on your server, and then it uploads it to S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. Does it work with any file uploaded to the media library? And by that I don&amp;#8217;t mean like just any file, but like let&amp;#8217;s say that I&amp;#8217;m using the WordPress function like WP sideload image. Do those get added to the media library too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Or do they actually have to go through like the WordPress admin upload screen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I believe &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m not 100% sure on the side loading. I&amp;#8217;ve never tested that. But that&amp;#8217;s basically you&amp;#8217;re downloading an asset from a URL and sticking it into WordPress. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it does upload those to S3. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure anything that ends up in the media library goes to S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And I&amp;#8217;m almost 100% sure on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I wonder if &amp;#8212; this is something I&amp;#8217;d want to look into and see what would happen. So like in EDD, for example, we have when we upload a file to a product, we actually stick it in a special directory inside WP content uploads that has HD access and other protection on the directory to keep those files from being shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Is there a way to disable certain files from being uploaded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Disable the &amp;#8212; just from being uploaded to S3 at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Like let&amp;#8217;s say I want to exclude anything that is inside a EDD directory, as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No, there&amp;#8217;s no way to do that. I mean, you could definitely hook into the hooks that are available and accomplish that in code. But there&amp;#8217;s no like UI to do that yet. But that&amp;#8217;s definitely something that could be added in the future. And a good use case would be like say you wanted all attachments to the post type event, right? Any attachment to events, maybe you want those to be private. You don&amp;#8217;t want them publicly downloadable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So maybe you could do that through a UI. That would be kind of a cool feature, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That would be cool. All right. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: But anyway, yeah, so actually the story is not done. I&amp;#8217;ve actually completely rewritten this plugin just a couple months ago, so it&amp;#8217;s no longer kind of like a few fixes. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s completely redone. And I actually split it out into two plugins, and so you have like a parent Amazon Web Services plugin on .org now, and that just houses the AWS SDK, which is massive. It&amp;#8217;s 10.2 megabytes actually. And so any plugin can, you know, use that as its parent plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that&amp;#8217;s what the Amazon S3 and CloudFront plugin does. So if you install just the Amazon S3 and CloudFront plugin, it&amp;#8217;ll say, &amp;#8220;Whoa, whoa, whoa. You need this other plugin.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. So Amazon S3 and CloudFront is really just an extension for Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Pretty much, yeah. That&amp;#8217;s a good way of saying it, yeah. And so it doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: It doesn&amp;#8217;t have all, you know, the bulk that it would. So say like in the future I&amp;#8217;d like to build an Amazon SES plugin, which is the simple email service that would hijack the email sending in WordPress. And I could use the Amazon Web Services parent plugin for that as well, right? I wouldn’t have to kind of double the efforts there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s very cool. I might have to give it a try and see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to keeping up with it and kind of just making I better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: It&amp;#8217;s one of those &amp;#8212; I think it&amp;#8217;s a great like utility plugin. There&amp;#8217;s those plugins that are just kind of fun to use, provide cool little bling for your site. And then there&amp;#8217;s plugins like this that you&amp;#8217;ve written that are really useful in terms of the overall functionality of your site, like how well your site functions, keeping it as a well-oiled machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, there&amp;#8217;s a number of other plugins out there that work with Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure. It&amp;#8217;s not a new thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. But the thing is that they usually do other things as well. They&amp;#8217;re like kind of like they do everything, whereas this thing does something very, very specific, and I try to keep it like, you know, very focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I feel like plugins that are like all in one, something or other, they kind of scare me a little bit because it&amp;#8217;s like, okay, but, well, do I need all that stuff? And how much stuff are you running that I don&amp;#8217;t need? And, you know, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Sure, totally. I love lightweight plugins, and I think this would be a great example if you wanted to &amp;#8212; if you were utilizing a CDN such as Amazon S3 for your stuff, but you didn&amp;#8217;t want to use something like W3 Total Cache that has all of that extra stuff in it. Let&amp;#8217;s say you only wanted to use it for the CDN aspect, this would be a great alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: For some of the stuff. Like if you&amp;#8217;re only doing it for media like files. Obviously that doesn&amp;#8217;t take care of your CSS and your JavaScript. But for your media files, that could be huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. So what&amp;#8217;s your plugin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I chose bbPress Custom Reply Topic Notifications. This is one of my plugins, and it&amp;#8217;s one of the ones that I actually updated this morning. And I chose it for a couple reasons. One, I really love bbPress. bbPress is a plugin that I really like working with. I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a bit of contribution to the core plugin as well. So bbPress 2.5 just came out, as we mentioned earlier, with the new forum subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this plugin, bbPress Custom Reply and Topic Notifications, is one that I wrote about a year ago, I think. And it allows you to customize the email that gets sent when a reply is posted to a topic you&amp;#8217;re subscribed to. So if you have a topic in a forum, and you subscribe to it, somebody else comes and posts a reply to it, you&amp;#8217;ll get an email that says, &amp;#8220;Hey, Brad Touesnard just posted a reply to this topic. Clear here to read it.&amp;#8221; Well, since bbPress 2.5 introduced forum subscriptions as well, this plugin has now been extended to allow you to customize the email that gets sent out when a new topic gets posted to a forum that you&amp;#8217;re subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to mention this in our noteworthy plugin section this morning is not just because I like the plugin, but because a cool thing happened yesterday. So Stephen Edgar, who is one of the core committers to bbPress, he&amp;#8217;s done a lot of bbPress plugins, he does a lot of bbPress support, and he does a lot of core bbPress development. He sent me a big pull request yesterday that actually added complete support for the new topic notifications. So this, I had not really had any plans to update the plugin to support topic notifications as well, but then Stephen just sent me this pull request that did all of it, and that was really, really cool. And so I wanted to feature it because it brings up the idea, the topic of community driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you have written a plugin does not mean that you are the only person that can contribute to that plugin. If you put your plugin up on GitHub or put it up somewhere where it&amp;#8217;s easy for other people to contribute to, there&amp;#8217;s no guarantee that somebody is going to, but it makes it a lot easier for that person that does decide to do it. And so this was a good example where Stephen, who is another bbPress developer, he uses the plugin, and he wanted the feature, so he just went ahead and added it and sent it as a pull request. So I pushed up an update this morning that had that. So it&amp;#8217;s really a thanks to Stephen for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8212; I love the idea of community driven development. Even for small plugins. I work on Easy Digital Downloads every day, which has about 80 contributors to it now, maybe a few more than that. But it&amp;#8217;s a huge plugin, and a lot of people use it, and a lot of people are making a living off of it or contributing to their living in some way, so it&amp;#8217;s a little easier for people to justify contributing. This is a little, tiny plugin that&amp;#8217;s been downloaded a total of, I think, 700 times. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that other people can&amp;#8217;t contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I mean, if someone else is finding it useful and they need, you know, something to be changed in it, the best way for them to, you know, take part and contribute to it and then, in the future, you know, you add something to it so then they get the benefit of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I mean, one of the things I do is I put a link on the .org page for my plugins to GitHub saying, you know, request features, report bugs, do all that in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I do the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And I think a lot of plugin developers would probably benefit from that as well. So if you don&amp;#8217;t have that link to your GitHub page on your .org &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Ironically, I don&amp;#8217;t have it on this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That’s funny. So maybe it&amp;#8217;s having the reverse effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah. So in order words, I need to take your advice and go put a link to GitHub on this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But I think you do bring up &amp;#8212; seriously, you do bring up a good point though that if you have a plugin on .org, and you have that plugin on GitHub as well, put a link to it that says it&amp;#8217;s on GitHub because I think you might be surprised at how often people are actually open and interested in contributing to a plugin, whether it&amp;#8217;s a bug fix or a feature addition. But I think the biggest reason that people don&amp;#8217;t is because it&amp;#8217;s difficult. But if you make it easy by making it very apparent where they can send these submissions, and sometimes those submissions are just like language translations, which are awesome too. But making it easy is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. I completely agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think you need to close that loop. That&amp;#8217;s why, you know, you link to GitHub. And then on GitHub, link to .org, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And you make this kind of circular reference. The way I run the Open Source projects on .org and GitHub is that I use the issue tracker on GitHub as kind of like the central issue tracker. So any support requests that end up on .org in the forums, I reply to them there and everything. But if it&amp;#8217;s an issue that is going to be addressed in the plugin, I&amp;#8217;ll kind of move it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Go to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I&amp;#8217;ll go to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, I do it the exact same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think of it as, like, GitHub is support for developers. .org is support for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And there&amp;#8217;s some overlap for sure. But like let&amp;#8217;s say a user reports a problem. If it&amp;#8217;s simply not sure how to use the plugin and not sure where a setting is, I help them on .org. Now if I find out that what they reported actually is a bug, I will go log that on GitHub and then take care of it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly. And I manage releases, like release milestones, on GitHub as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: You know, the tools are just not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I don&amp;#8217;t do anything on .org aside from a little bit of user support and hosting the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, exactly, the same here. I actually use Scribus scripts to &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; deploy to .org. Do you use those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I use one from Brainstorm Media from Paul Clark, which I think he actually forked from someone else. But it&amp;#8217;s all &amp;#8212; and they&amp;#8217;re all basically the same concept. You just run a script, and it takes your GitHub version and pushes it to .org for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, so &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Super handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Or my SVN history on .org is God awful though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Actually, no, that&amp;#8217;s not true. If you ever talk to Otto, he will yell at you if you try and use SVN on .org as an actual version control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: He will tell you that they actually only want people to have one commit for versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Uploading version 1.7. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, wow. That is very &amp;#8212; that is the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That&amp;#8217;s their preferred method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s the opposite of what I would have guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Why is that? Do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I think it&amp;#8217;s just because it&amp;#8217;s not designed to be your repository for your versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I mean, it&amp;#8217;s simply the distribution. Now obviously they have some version control in there because you can go back and download past versions. I suspect a lot of it has to do with the size. I mean, there&amp;#8217;s 28,000 plugins on .org. It&amp;#8217;s a little large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And that doesn&amp;#8217;t count the themes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Though technically they&amp;#8217;re in a different kind of system. But still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, so the &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yeah, no, so you&amp;#8217;re actually doing it the way that they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: That&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; well, I learn something new every day right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Well, before we run out of time, why don&amp;#8217;t we go ahead and jump onto our next topic because it&amp;#8217;s a good one, and we could probably talk about it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Unit testing: so this is actually one of our listeners requested this, and I apologize ahead of time if I pronounce your name wrong, but it was submitted by Ante Sepic. And he basically wanted to know about unit test, and he asked a couple things. How important are they? How important are they for plugins? Should you use them &amp;#8212; should you write unit test for your plugins? And how do you write; how do you make use of unit test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really large topic, so obviously we&amp;#8217;re not going to be able to hit everything on it, but we&amp;#8217;ll talk a little bit. And I think it&amp;#8217;ll work well because Brad and I come from kind of two, not really two different backgrounds here, but like I am actively using unit test for a couple of my plugins, and Brad, if I remember right, you&amp;#8217;re not yet. Correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: No. No, I&amp;#8217;m not. I&amp;#8217;ve done all the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And just never took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Cool. So for anybody who doesn&amp;#8217;t know, a unit test is basically an automated test on your code base, breaking the code base up unto tiny, tiny chunks. So you basically will have a test that will check each of your functions. So let&amp;#8217;s say that you have a function that determines if some user can view a particular page. Let&amp;#8217;s assume that you have a plugin that restricts content or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have a function that says: can user view this page? And so you will have a test, like an automated test that runs, and it will determine if that function is running correctly, is functioning correctly. And then you&amp;#8217;ll have a unit that will, for example, test that your functions are returning appropriate values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in EDD, for example, we have a function that calculates tax. And this function will take the tax rate set in the store settings. It&amp;#8217;ll take the current location of the customer we&amp;#8217;re calculating tax for, so let&amp;#8217;s say they&amp;#8217;re in the United States in the state of Alabama. So we go look up the Alabama state sales tax rate, et cetera, and then calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we will have a unit test that will actually use that function and pass at arbitrary amounts, so such as $54, $523, $1,200.23, et cetera. And we&amp;#8217;ll have this unit test that will pass all of these values through the function and make sure it always returns the expected value. And if the function doesn&amp;#8217;t, doesn&amp;#8217;t return the expected value, our test fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And it shows up in your unit test report as a big red thing, right, doesn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. It says, hey, we had a failure over here. We expected 3.74, but we got 5.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so it basically gives you an indication there&amp;#8217;s a bug somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And the reason this is important is because maybe, you know, you guys were working on something completely unrelated to this, but the code changed just enough that it disrupted that function, you know, or maybe it disrupted the input into that function. And so that&amp;#8217;s why &amp;#8212; and so you weren&amp;#8217;t even testing that function necessarily. You were testing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And so this is where, you know, unit tests are super important because they pick up these bugs in the things that you haven&amp;#8217;t really tested in your development testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Well, let&amp;#8217;s say that your &amp;#8212; unit tests are really, really important for really big plugins. They&amp;#8217;re important for all plugins, but not nearly as important for small plugins just because it&amp;#8217;s much easier to test them thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#8217;s say that your plugin has 30 files and 500 &amp;#8212; 20,000 lines of code, for example, and you change something. And like what Brad was saying, you might change something somewhere and not realize that it&amp;#8217;s going to have a consequence somewhere else. So your unit tests help catch those edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: We actually had a perfect example of this in EDD recently. I was working on the tax system in the plugin. I was actually rewriting it. And so we have this function that calculates the tax amount. And we used to, when we store a payment, we would &amp;#8212; the way that we calculated the tax for that payment and then stored it in the payment meta was kind of funky, but I didn&amp;#8217;t realize this. But my unit tests were failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was creating a purchase, and I stored the tax for it, and then I was using &amp;#8212; I was running a function to retrieve the tax amount for that payment. And I was doing this through my unit test, and my unit test was failing every time, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out why. Well, what I realized was that the function, the code that actually stored the tax in the payment originally was failing due to a change that I had made elsewhere in the tax system. But it didn&amp;#8217;t appear to fail, except for in the unit test. And it&amp;#8217;s something that I would have never caught if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for those unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Huh. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Just because the value was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: So is this function, so like say this calculate tax function, what are the parameters for that function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So in this case it has three parameters. It has the amount, so the amount that you&amp;#8217;re calculating tax on. Let&amp;#8217;s say $50. Followed by a country and a state or province. So you could use those to go look up the tax rates that are needed for this particular calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. And see, this is the big thing I feel with being aware of how unit testing works because sometimes you will write that function, and you&amp;#8217;ll just have one parameter, the amount. And then in the function, you&amp;#8217;ll figure out the country from, you know, the database, from the settings in the database and stuff. But then if you do it that way, it makes it very difficult to unit test that function because the database &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: &amp;#8212; is an unknown value. It could change. And so your unit test &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Right. Let&amp;#8217;s say it might work correctly when you&amp;#8217;re calculating based off of the state of Alabama in the U.S., but then fail when you&amp;#8217;re working in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so having &amp;#8212; number one, writing a function that is easily unit testable is really important, and there&amp;#8217;s a whole bunch of different things that go into that. But then also just having the test that will actually go through and run multiple tests. So when we test our calculate tax function, we actually do what are called assertions. Basically, we assert that some value is what we expect it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will actually run an assertion on like ten different countries/states and make sure that every single one of them comes back as we expect it to be. So that way, even if regardless of what our database tells us, if we pass this value, this is what we want to get. And we want to make sure that we get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right. I think one of the big criticisms of unit testing, although it seems that anyone that does test, that has moved to test driven development, never comes back. But the people that criticize it are usually on the basis that, well, it&amp;#8217;s going to add like, you know, double the time to develop because these tests take like, you know, as much time to write as the code itself. What do you say to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: I say that the first time that a unit tests help you track down a bug that you wouldn&amp;#8217;t have caught, it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: That, but it goes further than that too. It&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to track down a bug, I think, when a unit test fails than it is just to track down a bug when you get a report from odd behavior. Let&amp;#8217;s say, sticking with taxes for a moment. Let&amp;#8217;s say that a user reports that for some reason a customer was charged the wrong tax rate, and so you start thinking, hmm, how the heck do I test this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well, let&amp;#8217;s see if I can replicate it by, I&amp;#8217;ll go through the checkout process. I&amp;#8217;ll see what tax I&amp;#8217;m charged. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ll change my country to something else. I&amp;#8217;ll set my tax rates up the same way the user had them. And maybe you&amp;#8217;re able to replicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you have really a really good unit test, you should have a much better idea because, if one of those fails, it&amp;#8217;s going to tell you exactly where it failed and maybe &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;ll give you a better idea of why. For example, when a unit test fails, let&amp;#8217;s say it&amp;#8217;s my calculate tax test, there&amp;#8217;s ten assertions in that test, maybe more, so when that test fails, it&amp;#8217;s going to tell me exactly which assertion failed as well. And that immediately gives me a better idea of where the bug is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: The other thing, this one is huge for us. Unit testing is awesome; automated unit testing, even cooler. So like for EDD, we have it set up with a system called Travis-CI. And what it does is it runs our entire suite of unit test every single time we push to the GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So every single time we push, it triggers and automatic run of the unit test. So we will actually get a report any time a unit test fails. So if we make a commit and it causes some test to fail, we will get a notice about it, and it will say this commit made this particular test on this line number fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Mm-hmm, and &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: And so it&amp;#8217;s a really nice peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Does it &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;ve heard that you can actually reject the push, so you can run it actually prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Yes, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah, that would be kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which would be huge. I think it&amp;#8217;s really important, like if you had a production code base that you were pushing to, and so you will have unit tests running on your production code base, or maybe it&amp;#8217;d be on your staging code base. I&amp;#8217;ve never actually done this. But so you would have these tests run. And if it detected a test failed, it would reject it before the commit is actually made live, before it&amp;#8217;s actually put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Yeah. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: So, I mean, unit tests, I think we could go on forever about them. I think I just want to &amp;#8212; this has been really barely touching the surface of what unit tests are. So we might even &amp;#8212; maybe we&amp;#8217;ll have an entire episode one day that just talks about unit tests. It would be great if we got someone, another person on that had done a lot of unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Pippin, if there&amp;#8217;s one little boy or girl out there that we&amp;#8217;ve changed to a unit tester, I think we&amp;#8217;ve done our job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: But, yes, I mean, like we&amp;#8217;re barely scratching the surface here of what unit testing are, but it&amp;#8217;s something, if you have a large plugin, absolutely go look at it. I mean, like the EDD code base is enormous now, and I&amp;#8217;m so glad that we have unit tests on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re sitting on only 33% code coverage though, so there&amp;#8217;s a lot of code that does not have a unit test written for it. So start early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I think it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8212; we should mention also that WordPress Core has a full unit testing suite that you can set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Oh, yeah, they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: And run all the tests that the core developers do, so that&amp;#8217;s another place that you can….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: Which is really cool. I think there&amp;#8217;s a post on make.wordpress.org that actually shows how you can go and get that and how you can run the test. Don&amp;#8217;t be intimidated with unit tests because they can be kind of hard to set up the first time mostly just because, if you don&amp;#8217;t fully understand and are not fully familiar with how the system works, it can be a little overwhelming just because it&amp;#8217;s kind of convoluted at times. Power through it because once you have them set up, they are invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: I agree. Well &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right. Should we wrap it up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Let&amp;#8217;s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PIPPIN: All right. Thanks, everybody, for listening. This is Episode 8 of Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. We will be back in two weeks with Episode 9. Thanks, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRAD: Thanks, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

Transcript:

PIPPIN: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Episode 8 of Apply Filters, the podcast all about WordPress development. Im your host, Pippin Williamson, along with my cohost, Brad Touesnard.

BRAD: Hey, everyone.

PIPPIN: Today were going to talk, kind of do our standard format. Were going to talk a little bit about what weve been working on each, some noteworthy plugins, and then onto our main topic of Unit Test. So well probably go ahead and get started here with talking about what weve been working on recently. Brad, why dont you start?

BRAD: Sure. Ive actually been working on Migrate DB Pro, the plugin that I sell.

PIPPIN: Its kind of your standard project recently.

BRAD: Yeah. It takes up a lot of my time. And we just released the beta 2 of version 1.3 thats coming out, well, as soon as were out of beta, I guess.

PIPPIN: Awesome.

BRAD: Yeah, yeah.

PIPPIN: Do you have a list of beta testers that you have, or do you send them out to buyers? What do you do? How do you get your beta testers?

BRAD: Yeah. So we kind of started like a little spreadsheet of people, basically, and then I moved that to a list in Campaign Monitor to easily, you know, tap into and send emails to. And then today, I was just like, you know what, Im just going to invite everyone to join this list. And then I added an auto responder to it that would send them the details to get started beta testing. So as soon as they sign up for the email list, they get this email that says this is how you can, you know, get started. And I dont know. It seems to be working okay, but still an experiment.

PIPPIN: Sure.

BRAD: What about you? How do you do Easy Digital Downloads? How do you --

PIPPIN: When it comes to beta testers, it kind of depends on the plugin. Like for EDD, we usually send out to our entire mailing list, as well as like Twitter and Facebook, that we have a beta. And then well post about how people can get the beta, how they can test it, where to put feedback. But we dont have a list of like specific beta testers. And I think, honestly, probably the difference between a commercial plugin and a free plugin. Ive done beta tests with some of my commercial plugins before too, and Ive always done it exactly like you do where you have that list of people that you send it to, and its much more of a closed beta.

BRAD: Yeah, yeah. I mean, Ive just opened it up today, and its just exploding. We only had like 20 people, and now its like, you know, 5 times that today. Well, it was, like a half hour after I sent the email, it like quadrupled in size.

PIPPIN: The number of people that are beta testing or the feedback coming back from those people?

BRAD: Well, they sign up for the email list, so theyre interested --

PIPPIN: Oh, I gotcha.

BRAD: -- in getting the beta, so yeah.

PIPPIN: Do you actually get; do you get a pretty good kickback on beta testers in terms of quality feedback? Ive always noticed that its hit or miss. Like sometimes Ill send out a beta, and Ill get like dozens and dozens of pieces of feedback. And then other times Ill send out a beta </itunes:summary>

                    <itunes:summary>For Episode 3 we have our first guest on the show, John Turner of SeedProd. Along with joining into our usual discussion around WordPress development, John gives some insight into his own business, how he got started, what he does day to day, and what he has been working on.

We ran a little long last episode, so weve made an effort to keep it around 30 mins this time and will do so in the future as well.
