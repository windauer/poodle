                    <link>http://mahasukha.org/PODCASTS/Marut362.mp3</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
When we try to identify the individual self we think we have, we’re easily thrown into a kind of identity crisis.  In this podcast we learn what kind of self we really have, which is only an idea of the self – and this should come as good news!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This podcast comes from a talk on July 11, 2014, at the Banyen Bookstore in Vancouver.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
What we do or say is “good” or “bad” depending on the intention behind the action or speech.  And our experience, positive or negative, of others’ actions and words depend on the intention that we presume motivates them.
&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
Although traditional religions offer lots of different “pie in the sky” versions of the spiritual goal, when we probe the deeper levels they all tend to agree:  The real goal is radical acceptance of reality as it is.

Since we exist interdependently with the world around us, when we see ourselves trying to make the world a better place we become better people.  If we assume that others have helpful instead of harmful intentions towards us, we lose our fear and paranoia and are more inclined ourselves to have good intentions in our interactions with others.

We all want to do something to make the world a better place, but often we’re uncertain how to do it.  In this podcast, we review the logic, step-by-step, for why it is that when we change ourselves we actually do change the world.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
The two forms of discontentment that compel us to reject reality as it is are wanting something we don’t have and not wanting something we do have.  But “it’s like this now,” and learning to live without stress requires saying “yes” to life and accepting what life throws at us on a moment-to-moment basis.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
Another aspect of our modern life is the cult of busyness: the idea that our self-worth and importance is somehow tied to just staying busy all the time.  We’ve lost the fine art of just doing nothing.

"Here to Do Good,” the slogan of the Standard Charter Bank, suggests not only the importance of “doing good” but also a trustworthiness that should not be confused with unchangingness.  Change is, so it’s best to accept the cards you’re dealt.

In artistic expression and in pure play we engage in action for its own sake, and there’s no purpose to such acts.  When we’re in the flow, we’re engaged in mindful unselfconsciousness and get a little taste of what it’s like to be nobody – happy, integrated, and fully alive.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
The self we think we have is illusory.  There's no unchanging “I”; there’s no “I” independent of the body and mind; there’s no singular, unified “I”; and there’s no master “I” who can control the present in the present.
&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to find the “somebody self” we think exists and are so attached to is futile, because that self isn’t even there!  And we suffer due to our ignorance and illusions.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;
Beneath our relatively superficial differences, we’re all fundamentally the same. In this first of three podcasts on the theme, we discuss how everyone equally suffers. Because suffering is a subjective state of mind, it cannot be objectively measured, quantified, and ranked as to who is suffering more or less than anyone else.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This podcast was taken from a teaching given in August of 2013 at Mountain Yoga studio in South Lake Tahoe, California.

With the rise of widespread prosperity and affluence has also come a dramatic increase in self-centeredness and narcissism.  What was once labeled the “Me Decade” has expanded into a whole “i-Era.”

It’s the big question, but the answer is not at all straightforward. We’re all unique and special, but the individual “somebody self” we think really exists and try to make “uniquer” and “more special” is just an illusion.

We’re all desperately trying to be somebody. But maybe we got it all wrong. If we examine our lives, we find that we’re happiest when we stop striving to be  somebody and relax into the peace and joy of being nobody.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt; Karma is not so much a "law of nature" as it is an explanatory system for why we have the perceptions of the world we do.  And we have the perceptions we do because who we think we are which is shaped by our sense of the past -- our karma.  You don't HAVE karma, you ARE karma.

                    <link>http://aci-la.org/PODCASTS/Marut263.mp3</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Grasping to a spiritual practice is still grasping.  Drop the grasping and be free.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lama Marut helps us see how to realize the goal by being the goal. As he often says, if we want to live a happy life then practice happiness. If we're interested in achieving the enlightened state then pretend to be an enlightened being, and, as we do, little by little we convince ourselves we are. The means and the ends become the same.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lama Marut has said that the secret to happiness is to stop thinking about ourselves and start thinking about and doing things for others. A bodhisattva dedicates their life to the service of everyone else and trains in the six perfections. Here Lama Marut talks about the first three of these perfections.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Bodhicitta is the wish to get enlightened as quickly as possible for the sake of all sentient beings. A bodhisattva is somebody who has bodhicitta. Being a bodhisattva is way more than just being a nice guy. What would it look like to have bodhicitta in our modern world?

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of Buddhism is to be free – to become unaddicted.  Lama Marut urges us in this segment of an interview to work with the tool of meditation in order to regain control of ourselves and be free of our addictions.  But he also warns us to not just get re-addicted to the peaceful, narcotic states of mind meditation brings.

And it doesn’t look as though everything exists dependently and not independently. But subjects cannot exist without objects to perceive, and objects cannot exist without subjects to perceive them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This podcast was taken from a teaching at the annual Windhover Retreat in Rockport, Massachusetts, August of 2009

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The point of guru yoga is to first become able to see the divine directly in your world, and then secondly to become the divine yourself.  The esoteric, secret traditions of many world religions suggest something very radical:  that the way to the goal of perfection is to practice it in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given at the annual Thanksgiving retreat weekend at Lake Tahoe, in November of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>The point of guru yoga is to first become able to see the divine directly in your world, and then secondly to become the divine yourself.  The esoteric, secret traditions of many world religions suggest something very radical:  that the way to the goal of perfection is to practice it in the here and now.This podcast comes from teachings given at the annual Thanksgiving retreat weekend at Lake Tahoe, in November of 2008.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The “guru” is nothing other than the appearance in your life of the sacred in the form of a living being.  And the guru can appear in any way that would help you see the special nature of the world around you.  The special people in your life, however, are only special if you constitute them as sacred and invest them with the power to help you. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We all have a deep desire to live in a world of magic and miracles.  We can, with training, learn to see the sacred and special all around us.  The perception that things are just ordinary is just a subjective interpretation.  When we change the subjective apparatus that filters our perceptions of the world, our world will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given at the annual Thanksgiving retreat weekend at Lake Tahoe, in November of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Which part of you doesn’t want to be happy?  Holding onto the idea that nothing is special or extraordinary – that life is just humdrum and meaningless – is a major obstacle to happiness and the compassion that true happiness makes possible.  The way to this goal is to reintroduce the sacred into our lives.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given at the annual Thanksgiving retreat weekend at Lake Tahoe, in November of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;If there was a self the way we think there is, it would have to be the same as or different from its parts.  The only self that exists is just a concept or idea of a self.  The self is therefore perfectible if we create the karma that would force us to have a different conceptualization of ourselves.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we encounter teachings within our tradition that we can’t accept at present or feel doubts about our teachers.  Instead of definitively rejecting such teachings or the teacher, it is important to try to just “shelve it” rather than just abandon your religion or your teacher when things get hard.  The practitioners who stick to it make real progress, whereas those who just bail out over and over again do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given in Vancouver in February of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The vows of a bodhisattva guide us in leading a selfless, compassionate, and altruistic life.  They help us lose ourselves in the service of others, and are based on understanding that all beings have just as much right as we do to be happy and avoid pain.   Our own happiness is not somehow privileged, and when we realize this and begin to work toward the happiness of others we will truly be pursuing the causes of our own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given in Vancouver in February of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

Our own happiness is not somehow privileged, and when we realize this and begin to work toward the happiness of others we will truly be pursuing the causes of our own happiness.This podcast comes from teachings given in Vancouver in February of 2009.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Buddhist vows are like training wheels for retraining our instincts and disciplining ourselves to do the right things.  The first level of vows help us restrain our habit of hurting others, for harming others is the direct cause of our own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given in Vancouver in February of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write to us at: podcast@aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The karma of giving into anger is the propensity to get angry again.  Even a little resistance can start to undermine anger’s power.  Conversely, the habit of patience also snowballs over time, getting easier and easier the more we practice it.  Eventually, we can even learn to be grateful to all those who hurt or irritate us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given at the Prana House, Melbourne, Australia, in January of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;One kind of contentment is just being happy being in the present instead of constantly living in past and future.  And when we think about the past we are needlessly making ourselves unhappy with nostalgia or resentment.  In this podcast, Lama Marut teaches how to change your understanding of the past in order to be happier in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings given at the Prana House, Melbourne, Australia, in January of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>Learning How to Live. . . and Die</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;How can we live a good spiritual life and die a good death?  The essence of living well is service to others, especially one’s parents and one’s religious teacher.  And just as a good life involves living for others, a good death is one done sacrificially and altruistically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a retreat on compassion held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2007, in South Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Compassion and love are the two wings of a good heart.  They are the opposite of being happy about the unhappiness others experience, and being unhappy about the happiness of others.  If we are interested in being happy ourselves, we must overcome these nasty tendencies toward envy and resentment which are, in turn, based on a false idea of a “me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a retreat on compassion held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2007, in South Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Compassion for others depends on first having compassion for yourself, which means recognizing your own suffering and really wanting to end it.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;“Dharma” means what will hold you up, what you can count on when things go wrong.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of religion is to learn how to live a happy life.  Consumer capitalism, on the other hand, depends on our constantly dissatisfaction.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;“Yoga” means to “unite” or “yoke” yourself to something, and the highest form of yoga is connecting yourself to a teacher –- “guru yoga” – and to an authentic lineage.  Now that yoga has come to the West, it is our responsibility to preserve this tradition, and we do so in part by respecting our teachers and the lineages they represent.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Yoga is meant to produce happiness, and in order to reach that end we must practice.  We start by just pretending to be happy, by “impersonating a happy person,” and training ourselves to do the opposite of our instincts (which are usually 180 degrees wrong).  Yoga, claims Lama Marut, is the inversion of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was taken from a yoga teacher training retreat weekend held in September, 2008, at South Lake Tahoe and sponsored by Zuda Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Yoga is a whole lifestyle, which includes disciplining the mind and one’s actions and life all day long.  In this podcast, Lama Marut reviews yoga as it is taught in the Bhagavad Gita and then concentrates on the practice of karma yoga, especially as it pertains to being very careful about one’s morality and not harm others.  We must discipline ourselves to retrain our instincts in order to avoid suffering and eventually attain the freedom yoga promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast was taken from a teaching given at The Shala yoga center in New York City in December, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Can we destroy bad karma from the past before it ripens?

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Buddhism comes to the West, it must change to fit the new times and culture.  The traditional patriarchal orientation of Asian Buddhism cannot last here, nor can the traditional division between the monastics and the laity.  But the essence cannot be watered down if Buddhism is to survive here.  The fundamental teachings on emptiness and dependent origination are the core, and their radical implications are central to the religion of Mahayana Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview was conducted in July of 2008 in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this interview, Lama Marut decries the tendency of Western Buddhism to dumb down the Buddha’s teaching and present it as just a handmaiden to modern psychology.  The Buddha’s teaching is not merely a coping mechanism to help us suffer a little less.  It is meant to produce perfect happiness and full Buddhahood, and these high goals are possible to reach because everything is empty of having any nature of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interview was conducted in July of 2008 in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Our spiritual path involves the attempt to “reach” the divine, and in two senses.  First, we reach the divine in the sense of seeing them in our world as the divine.  The sacred is imminent, but we don’t recognize it.  Once we “reach” the divine in the first sense, we are close to “reaching” in the second sense.

First, we reach the divine in the sense of seeing them in our world as the divine.  The sacred is imminent, but we don’t recognize it.  Once we “reach” the divine in the first sense, we are close to “reaching” in the second sense.

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus’s said it was possible to achieve perfection, and we must believe that if we are ever going to achieve perfection.  If there were a hard-wired “self” that existed as a limited, suffering being, perfection would be impossible.  Fortunately, the self is just an idea, a concept, that can be changed over time.  It is our destiny, our higher calling, to reach perfection in this life.  And on the way to that goal, we will all one day have a direct and transformative experience of the sacred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on Christianity given in New York City in April of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus’s last words on the cross were, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.”   We do not know what we’re doing; we are very, very ignorant.  We must recognize our ignorance before we can replace it with wisdom.  Four types of ignorance – four types of ways our minds turn things around -- are identified in this podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on Christianity given in New York City in April of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a freeing power to the truth, for we are imprisoned by our ignorance.  Error has kept us in chains.  And one of the principal manifestation of error in our lives is thinking that things exist in ways that they cannot  -- essentially, objectively, and as unitary things that exist as wholes apart from our minds that construct them into those wholes.  Things must be coming from us and not at us.

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As we move toward the highest spiritual goal – the perfect happiness Jesus called the “Kingdom of Heaven” – we have to maintain a regular and on-going training.  Daily practice and self-discipline is mandatory; we achieve our goals only gradually.  But we are getting closer and closer to the “Kingdom of Heaven,” and the proof of that is the miracles – like the internet itself – which are springing up all around us.  Our experience of the world is just the product of our conceptualizations of it.  Things are coming from us, not at us.   We need to plant the karmic seeds to see the world as perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus’s message was revolutionary, and we as spiritual practitioners should try to imitate Christ.  The spiritual life isn’t to learn to fit in better with society but to break from it and to try reach the “kingdom of heaven” which is within each of us.  We can’t serve both God and Mammon, the spiritual life and shopping mall culture, at the same time.  We have to make some choices, beginning with turning off the television!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on Christianity given in New York City in April of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Other beings give us the opportunity to overcome the very source of our own suffering – our self-cherishing.  We need to develop techniques to go against the grain of our selfishness; we need to dismantle our pride in self in order to be happy.

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The “Four Great Facts” keep us balanced between the two extremes of a) thinking things exist “out there,” on their own, objectively, and b) thinking that things don’t exist at all.  First, nothing exists “naturally” or independently, but (second) that doesn’t mean that things don’t exist at all.  Third, everything exists “merely by convention” (“nominally,” or because we project them), but (fourth) everything exists without existing naturally.  What this means is that nothing exists independently, but everything does exist interdependently.  Which also means everything can change!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>Things Exist. . . But Not How They Seem</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The “Middle Way” of Buddhist philosophy is located between the extremes of thinking that things must exist the way they seem, on the one hand; and thinking that if they don’t exist as they seem they must not exist at all on the other.  Things do exist, but they do not exist objectively.  They exist when we perceive them, and not until then.  Science itself is not an objective observation of the world but rather a set of ever-changing projections about the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>The “Middle Way” of Buddhist philosophy is located between the extremes of thinking that things must exist the way they seem, on the one hand; and thinking that if they don’t exist as they seem they must not exist at all on the other.  Things do exist, but they do not exist objectively.  They exist when we perceive them, and not until then.  Science itself is not an objective observation of the world but rather a set of ever-changing projections about the world. This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The training in wisdom – how things exist and how they don’t – saves us from perpetuating our suffering.  When an unpleasant thing or person occurs, our wisdom helps us overcome our inclinations and break the cycle that brought us the unpleasant thing or person in the first place.  Getting upset at things we ourselves created is like honking in a traffic jam – it just makes things worse!  Nirvana is not somewhere else; it is potentially right here and now, if we stopped creating the causes for our own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <title>Why We Should Do Good Things</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to do good actions like giving because someone told you to do it or because you think it would be nice to.  It’s quite another thing to give because you understand why.  Lama Marut in this podcast goes into the emptiness of the “three spheres” of giving – and therefore why such an action works in beneficial ways to yourself.  Understanding how things are really working can magnify the benefits of one’s good deeds.  This is the way to enlightenment – knowing that karma itself is empty and just a projection like everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The highest form of compassion or “bodhicitta” is divided into its “deceptive” and “ultimate” forms.  The former is the wish to help alleviate the suffering of the beings who appear in our world.  But ultimate bodhicitta is a transformative mystical experience that allows us to understand that there are no suffering beings who exist in any other way than as projections coming from us.  This is the “good news” or “gospel” of emptiness: all things can be changed because all things are empty of having any nature of their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

Lama Marut here urges us not to domesticate the tiger that is your practice by making it safe.  The purpose of one’s spiritual life is not to try to fit into samsara better.  Rather, we must think of ourselves as alienated rebels, like the sadhus of traditional India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from teachings on the philosophy of yoga given in Vancouver, Canada, in March, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;This podcast concludes the overview of the classic seven-step cause and effect method for generating bodhicitta (“spiritual O.C.D.”).  After a review of “step zero” (equalizing all beings) and step one (thinking of all beings as your mother), we continue to steps two (recollecting what your mother in this life has done for you), three (feeling deep indebtedness to your mother and all mother beings and the wish to repay them), four (the wish that all your mothers be happy), five (compassion for their suffering), six (taking personal responsibility for their welfare), and finally step seven, which is the determination to get enlightened as soon as possible in order to save all mother sentient beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on compassion given at a retreat in South Lake Tahoe, California, over Thanksgiving weekend, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>This podcast concludes the overview of the classic seven-step cause and effect method for generating bodhicitta (“spiritual O.C.D.”).  After a review of “step zero” (equalizing all beings) and step one (thinking of all beings as your mother), we continue to steps two (recollecting what your mother in this life has done for you), three (feeling deep indebtedness to your mother and all mother beings and the wish to repay them), four (the wish that all your mothers be happy), five (compassion for their suffering), six (taking personal responsibility for their welfare), and finally step seven, which is the determination to get enlightened as soon as possible in order to save all mother sentient beings.This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on compassion given at a retreat in South Lake Tahoe, California, over Thanksgiving weekend, 2007.

                    <title>Part 1: Seven Steps to Achieving Ultimate Compassion</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The classic seven-step cause and effect method for achieving true compassion begins with “step zero.”  We first try to gain equanimity, thinking that all beings (those I like, those I dislike, and those I’m neutral about) are equally worthy of my love and compassion.  We’re then ready to begin with the first step proper, which is to consider all beings as having been your mother in past lives.  To do this step, we also have to prove to ourselves that there have been countless past lives, without beginning.  We have to reject the illogical idea that there could be a first cause that wasn’t itself caused and therefore everything is just unfolding randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Until we look at the fact that we actually don’t like some people – people who really irritate us or who have really hurt us – we can’t get rid of these wholly unhealthy feelings. Once we have admitted our anger, hatred, and hurt, we can then analyze whether or not they are in our best self-interest. To forgive others is hard, but we can’t wait for them to come groveling to us, begging us to forgive them. We must do it unilaterally and preemptively, because forgiveness isn’t for them, it’s for you.

                    <title>Going Against the Grain</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day is another opportunity to start anew, to begin to seriously try to live a happy life dedicated to the service of others.  But to do this we have to go “against the grain” of our own bad habits.  We must say “no” to our addiction to suffering.  To reverse our negative tendencies, we must first stop being complacent.  We must stop being inured to our suffering, living in our little bubbles, and recognize it for what it is -- like the Buddha himself did when he finally left his pampered life and saw what this life really has in store for us. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lama Marut here challenges some of the current Western understandings of Buddhism.  As Buddhism comes to our culture we must be careful not to just extract what we find comfortable in Buddhism and ignore what might be difficult.  Buddhism is not just a psychological tool for managing samsara.  It is a method for overcoming all limitations (including death itself) and achieving total enlightenment in this very lifetime.  Because everything is empty of self-existence, everything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught karma, just like the Buddha and other teachers of the Eastern traditions.  We can’t achieve security and peace by bringing insecurity to others through making war on them.  We all receive what we have done to others.  And the wisdom side of religious traditions teach us why it is possible to work the cosmic rules and achieve the “Kingdom of Heaven” here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on Christianity given in New York City in April of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <itunes:summary>Jesus taught karma, just like the Buddha and other teachers of the Eastern traditions.  We can’t achieve security and peace by bringing insecurity to others through making war on them.  We all receive what we have done to others.  And the wisdom side of religious traditions teach us why it is possible to work the cosmic rules and achieve the “Kingdom of Heaven” here and now.This podcast was extracted from a set of teachings on Christianity given in New York City in April of 2008.

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve the goal of a spiritual life – total and complete happiness – we have to retrain ourselves on a daily basis.  In this first of three podcasts on how to develop a good daily practice, Lama Marut recommends that we get a good night sleep every night and wake up slowly and naturally every morning.  And before getting out of bed recall what a miracle your life is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a series of teachings given at the Windhover Performing Arts Center in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, in August of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Buddha said that suffering is not inevitable.  Buddhism, like all religions, holds out the promise of perfect happiness in the future.  But we must work toward this goal in part by practicing being happy all the time.  Lama Marut here points out that there is never a time where it makes sense to be anything other than happy.&lt;/p&gt;

These feelings are impermanent, out of our control in the present moment, not just random but caused by karma, empty of having the qualities we impute on them, exist only as interpretations, and ultimately are entirely projected from us due to how we have treated others in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a retreat held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2006, in South Lake Tahoe, California.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Buddha taught all the other of the lower worldviews we’ve reviewed in the past five podcasts, it is only the sixth and highest version of emptiness that is fully correct.  The sixth “flavour” of emptiness is the contention that nothing is coming from “out there.”  Everything is a projection or imputation coming from our minds, forced on us by how we have treated others in the past.  And it is only this understanding of emptiness is that explains why our own Buddhahood and the transformation of our world into a paradise is really possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a retreat held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2006, in South Lake Tahoe, California.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the example of a pen, Lama Marut shows how it is empty -- there’s something not there we thought was there.  There’s no “pen-ness” to a pen, that is, no essence.  It can’t exist “out there,” objectively or inherently, as a pen.  It is not a pen until we conceptualize and label it as a pen.  And all things exist only like that.  But what causes us to label the things in the world the way we do?  And how can we change those causes such that we would be forced to conceptualize our world and everything in it as perfect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast comes from a “Dharma Essentials” course on the Diamond Cutter Sutra taught in Los Angeles in April, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing his teachings on the different schools’ understanding of emptiness, Lama Marut turns now to “worldview three”:  things are empty of coming from any other place than karmic causes.

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this second podcast on the topic of the various “flavors” of emptiness, Lama Marut covers the second level of understanding ultimate reality:  Things are empty of having a “controlling self” or some kind of unchanging essence or self-nature.  The example of an irritating person (who does not exist from his or her own side as an irritating person) is  provided to prove that things are empty of having a “self” or essence but rather are empty in this way.  A further implication of this is that we are empty of having a self that can control present things in the present.  We must stop obsessing about things we can’t change in the present and always “garden” for future effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a retreat held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2006, in South Lake Tahoe, California.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Karma comes in three forms: good, bad, and neutral.  But even good karma, which we experience as something pleasurable, just wears out as we use it up.  We lose every good thing we have unless we recreate the causes that brought us the pleasant experience in the first place.  If we want to maintain a good relationship with our partner, for example, we must think about what we could do to make them happy (the real and only cause for that good relationship in the first place) instead of always being concerned about what they could be doing for us to fill our needs and wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a Diamond Mountain University course on “Karma Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita” taught in Tucson, Arizona, Oct. 9, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For if we’re leading a happy life, we’re of benefit to others.  If not, we’re a charity case.  To achieve true happiness we must let go of our attachment to a lower, suffering self and desire “ecstasy,” which means to “stand outside” of our old caterpillar selves and become the butterflies we are meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a Diamond Mountain University course on “Killing Anger” taught in Tucson, Arizona, in the spring of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, Lama Marut concludes His teachings on devotion (bhakti) in the Bhagavad Gita.  We must ‘see beyond mere appearances’ and use our best understanding of emptiness to stay firm in our view of who the Guru really is for us.  Through this practice, the first stage is that our Guru appears to us as perfect, an enlightened being, and through single-minded yoga they begin to appear to us everywhere and in all beings. The second stage is that we are yoked to, or merge with that being such that we become perfect ourselves.  This is considered one of the most supreme esoteric teachings; the one who performs the highest devotion will reach the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, Lama Marut examines the Bhagavad Gita’s verses on single-minded devotion to the Guru.  The devotional tradition discusses various methods such as developing faith, discipline and making offerings as ways in which we may lose our ‘small self’ in service to the teacher.  In surrendering to the Guru, we are surrendering to the highest part of ourselves.  Essentially we try to perfect ourselves by fixing the mind and intellect singularly on the perfection of another.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Bhagavad Gita, the yoga of devotion to your teacher (bhakti yoga)  is considered the highest spiritual practice. This podcast examines who the Guru really is and the most beneficial way we can regard this special being in our lives.  Because the Guru is "empty" we can usefully see him or her as being a full enlightened being who has come to help us directly on our path.  Lama Marut asks, "If you can then expand that view to all beings in your world, what kind of being would that make you?"&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The guru is empty, a projection or mirror of your own good qualities.  In order to perfect oneself, one must first practice seeing perfection in another – in the first place, in the guru, and eventually in every other being.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given to a small group in Kinvara, Ireland, on &lt;br /&gt;June 14, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>The Qualities of a Good Guru</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Buddhist texts, a number of qualities one should look for in guru or spiritual teacher are enumerated.  Before taking a guru, one should check to see if you see some or all of these qualities in a potential teacher.  And once we have found a being that we see in this special way, we must learn how to think about him or her in the proper way – as nothing less than a full-fledged Buddha who has come into your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given to a small group in Kinvara, Ireland, on &lt;br /&gt;June 14, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this second segment on how to develop a daily practice, Lama Marut picks up with the daily “morning loll” in which, before getting out of bed, we remember that each day could be the last one we have to live so we stop taking things for granted.  We need to also learn to be “unbusy,” spending time quiet and alone every morning contemplating the meaning of our lives, practice daily meditation, and some kind of physical practice like yoga with the proper motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a series of teachings given at the Windhover Performing Arts Center in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, in August of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Linking or joining yourself to a guru or spiritual teacher is the beginning (“alpha”), middle, and end (“omega”) of the path to happiness and enlightenment.  The first step is appreciating how important the guru is for us and being grateful for the teachers that have been and are in our lives already.  But even more crucial is understanding where the guru is really coming from.  Gurus don’t exist “out there” in the world as gurus.  They are projections coming from the best part of us.  Gurus, like everything else, are empty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given to a small group in Kinvara, Ireland, on &lt;br /&gt;June 14, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We often hear how important it is to live in the present in order to be happy.  But what are the actual methods for doing this?  Paradoxically, we are not in the present when we are overly self-conscious and we are fully present only when we wholly forget and lose ourselves in an activity.  So in order to live in the here and now we must transcend the sense of self that keeps us from being truly present.   In Buddhism, we do this through cultivating wisdom (realizing selflessness) and compassion (learning to care more about others than oneself).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at Santa Monica, California, on April 25, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Many religions urge us to develop faith in the future in order to live a happier life in the present.  The opposite of faith is lazy doubt or irresolution about how life is working – which then results in anxiety.

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Being happy in the present requires both that we revision our past (through forgiveness and gratitude) and that we overcome our anxieties about the future.  In this podcast, Lama Marut urges us to stop imagining a nightmarish future and instead develop the antidote for anxiety: faith, trust, and confidence in the future.  Grounding the teaching in verses from Arya Nagarjuna’s “Precious Garland,” we learn to rely on our practice and wisdom to gain control over our future by living a good moral life in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at a public talk in Los Angeles, California, on December 11, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness helps us generate gratitude, love, and compassion toward others – and vice versa.  If we can understand how much suffering others are going through we can gain a different perspective on why they would hurt us.  If we can generate wisdom about what the real cause of pain in the world is – anger itself – then why would we ever feel anger ourselves?  We must break the cycle and give up anger and resentment, practice forgiveness, and only wish happiness on others if we want to be happy ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at a public talk in Tucson, Arizona, on November 15, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <itunes:summary>Forgiveness helps us generate gratitude, love, and compassion toward others – and vice versa.  If we can understand how much suffering others are going through we can gain a different perspective on why they would hurt us.  If we can generate wisdom about what the real cause of pain in the world is – anger itself – then why would we ever feel anger ourselves?  We must break the cycle and give up anger and resentment, practice forgiveness, and only wish happiness on others if we want to be happy ourselves.This podcast is taken from a teaching given at a public talk in Tucson, Arizona, on November 15, 2006.For complete audio teachings, please go to:http://www.aci-la.organdhttp://www.lamamarut.org</itunes:summary>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;How can we cultivate forbearance, patience, and forgiveness in our daily lives?  One way to do so is to think about the advantages of suffering and be grateful for everything that has ever happened, very much including all the pain others have caused you.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at a public talk in Tucson, Arizona, on November 15, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>The Disadvantages of Anger</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In a continuation of a teaching on forgiveness, in this podcast we turn to the problem of anger.  We don’t forgive others because we’re angry at them.  So if we are interested in cultivating forgiveness we must uproot anger through its opposite -- patience.  Reviewing some relevant verses from the sixth chapter of Master Shantideva’s classic, Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life, Lama Marut here lays out some of the advantages of patience and forgiveness and the disadvantages of anger and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at Rockport, Massachusetts, on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Lama Marut’s teachings on the mahamudra emptiness meditation continue with “worldview four” – things are empty of having the qualities we attribute to them from their own side.  The judgments we make about things and people are coming from us, then projected onto those things and people, and then mistaken for qualities they inherently have.  While this does not mean we shouldn’t judge others’ actions, we cannot legitimately go on to judge persons.  Since we can never really know who another person is, we always have two unconfirmable possibilities: he or she is just an ordinary being, or that person is an enlightened angel sent to teach us.  Which of these two possibilities would be more useful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a retreat held over Thanksgiving weekend, 2006, in South Lake Tahoe, California.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                    <title>The Greatest Sin</title>
                    <link>http://lamamarut.org/</link>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the open teachings of Buddhism, the biggest mistake is to see things as if they had “self-existence” and were not related to your own karma.  In the secret teachings, the biggest error is seeing your life as ordinary instead of paying attention to the miracles that are all around us.  Just paying attention to the facts of our lives, being mindful and living “here and now,” will help us live a happier life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast was taken from a Tibetan Heart Yoga Teacher Training course given at the Three Jewels Bookstore in New York City on March 14, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In this discussion about forgiveness, Lama Marut urges us to change the past by re-writing it in order to be happier in the present.  In order to reinvent our past in a beneficial way, we need to let go of our resentments and forgive everybody who hurt or offended us.  But we must also be clear on what forgiveness really is, and what it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast is taken from a teaching given at Rockport, Massachusetts, on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For complete audio teachings, please go to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.aci-la.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://www.lamamarut.org&lt;/p&gt;</description>
