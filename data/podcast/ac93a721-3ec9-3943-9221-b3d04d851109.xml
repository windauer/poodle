                    <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/83/19/38/altruistrecordings/1400x1400_8886361.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rock The Boat: Hailing from our own fair city and one of the hardest working men in the underground music scene today, Todd Fatjo is in the house for UMS 111!  We were able to snag the multi-faceted DJ at the open-seas 10th anniversary party for Camouflage, Christian Bruna's world-famous DNB/House mashup.

Our man rode some righteous waves for a packed, rapturous crowd celebrating the Camo anniversary, and the ER crew was on hand to ride shotgun alongside.  With his love for an incredible variety of genres and dedication to rocking them all at full capacity, Mr. Fatjo and friends at the weekly &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/ReleaseNYC" target="_new"&gt;Release&lt;/a&gt; event (yes you &lt;a href ="http://www.facebook.com/preethichaparala?fref=ts" target="_new"&gt;Miss Pree!&lt;/a&gt;) are focused on bringing back the old school vibe to Gotham - people, that is something ER can get behind.

And before you check out his set, make sure not to miss Diggy's interview with Todd, where we learn more about his view on the old NY vs. the new NY, the variety of styles and influences he plays, how Release is pushing the no-nonsense party vibes, and much more.  Hang ten!

One party that has had solid vibes and a great atmosphere has been of New York City's The Loop. 
This week we have a recording of Circus Recordings' Yousef on the decks when he headlined a party along with Perry, Gino Santos and Bot at Lillium (@The W Hotel)
Yousef delivers a great set filled with upbeat songs which had the whole room at Lillium moving.

More about Yousef:

Yousef is a man firmly in control of his imminent destiny. Having been at the forefront of dance music fan’s attentions across the globe since the latter stages of the last century, he’s an artist that continues to evolve and develop with consummate ease. New sounds, new developments and new frontiers; they all remain an instrumental part of his thrust forward as one the planet’s leading underground House music tastemakers.

As a producer he continues to smash preconceptions about not only his style but the wider spectrum of House and Techno as well. Recently he’s gifted his beats to an ever expanding cluster of the most revered and respected imprints in the business, be them Carl Cox’s Intec, Nick Curly’s Cecille, Nic Fanciuilli’s Saved, the effervescent Monique Musique and of course Sven Vath’s timeless label Cocoon which released ‘Come Home’, Yousef’s stunning piece de resistance.

He’s recently finished his second full artist album, adding a series of more musically focused tracks to his resume alongside the serious (self penned) emotive vocal moments and of course many dance floor workouts (currently getting endless love from Loco Dice, Magda, Nic Fancuilli, Carl Cox, Guti and Uner). Coming soon is a developing live concept that redefines how electronic music is experienced.

That keen ear is also set to see a return to global radio in the near future.

Yousef’s record label “Circus Recordings” has had an excellent year, releasing tracks From Sven Vath, Four Tet, Gilles Peterson, Santos &amp; Yousef himself, as well as signing a killer single from one of the dominant forces in Yousef’s career DJ Sneak. Alongside the kingpins of electronic music it is also pushing the next generation with Maher Daniel, Tom Flynn, Yostek and Doomwork and Acid Mondays, the latter discovered by Yousef.

And the what of the club-night that the label adorns the name of? Circus continues to dominate UK clubbing with its stunning ensembles of talent month after month. Whether going solo or doing parties with Planet E, Cocoon or BBC Radio One for the historic 500th Essential Mix, they’ve always got the mixture of established and the soon to be huge perfectly balanced. Sven Vath, Carl Cox, Ritchie Hawtin, Loco Dice, Luciano, Ricardo Vilalobos, Laurent Garnier (DJ &amp; Live), Carl Craig and Adam Beyer are among those representing the former, whilst they can lay claim to being among the very first to champion the likes of Seth Troxler, Maya Jane Coles and Resident Advisor’s No 1 DJ Jamie Jones.

It’s exalted company that Yousef is more than comfortable alongside. Recent key gigs on home soil at the Warehouse Project, Global Gathering and now a Circus London regular at the new Egg where his kaleidoscopic approach to house will be part of the re-shape of what is an incredible venue. His European pedigree continues with strong followings across the continent - Fabrik in Madrid, Kristal in Bucharest, and further shows in Helsinki, Italy or his new residency with Duel Beat in Napoli attest to this. 

He also continues to etch his name in the folklore of South American clubbing with stops in Argentina, Chile and Brazil, the latter boasting D-Edge and Warung as Yousef destinations. Ultra Music continues to take electronic music festivals to a whole new dimension and their support for Yousef has seen appearances at their events in Miami, Sao Paulo, Warsaw and Seoul. An unprecedented five-week tour of Asia, Australia and New Zealand was a highlight of the latter stages of last year maintained his deity status of that part of the world. And of course he enjoys a similar reverence at dance music’s centre piece, Ibiza.

Ever since he first travelled there as a starry eyed dance music fanatic in the late nineties Yousef has had a very special relationship with the white isle, having lived there intermittently during that time and DJed consistently there since 1998. He still enjoys a gloriously fruitful residency with Carl Cox and his Ibiza’s number 1 club event “Revolution” parties on Tuesdays at Space, with further appearances at DC-10’s Circo Loco event throughout the summer

His style remains perfectly emblematic of the dance floor dexterity needed in the modern clubspace, bringing the seductive groove and swing of classic house just as readily as the energy of techno, all along maintaining the vibe of authentic dj over 3 decks without a computer in sight. Whether delivering hedonistic immediacy or crafting extended sets riddled with subtlety, Yousef is both technically and musically peerless in his field, one of the globe’s finest exponents of a four-four beat.

A 21st century artist in scope, sound and stance, his lust for electronic music as a producer, promoter, DJ, record label owner and music enthusiast is stronger than ever. His efforts are thoughtful and considered and all approached with meaning; Yousef is there to educate as well as entertain. There are few who balance musical maturity with an exciting creative edge, and it’s the experience informed from his illustrious past combining with the forward thinking surge to the future that makes his musical manoeuvres so irresistibly potent. The man remains an unstoppable juggernaut of electronica.

                    <title>Underground Movement Show - Episode 108 - Florian Meindl</title>
                    <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/83/19/38/altruistrecordings/1400x1400_8657672.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLASH and Thunder:&lt;/strong&gt;

One of the ER staff's favorite techno and tech-house producers the last few years, and yet this prolific and talented European artist is not well enough known in the US.  We're here to change that dammit, starting right now.  It's Berlin by way of London and Austria.  It's FLASH Recordings (his own label) by way of Trapez, Suara, Resopal, Great Stuff, Traum, and too many others to name here.  It's Florian Meindl with a massive live 2 hour set at Propaganada!  Big shouts to the Sullivan Room crew, Sr. Serge, and Gene Meandisco for making this one happen.

We guarantee you, you cannot listen to this mix without searching out Florian's music immediately afterwards. Double dog dare ya.

And did we mention, we were able to grab Florian himself for an exclusive interview after his gig?  Keep it scrollin' (but first click 'play').


&lt;strong&gt; ER's Exclusive Interview with Florian Meindl&lt;/strong&gt;

Florian, thanks so much for joining us here on ElectronicRhythm.com, and for your exclusive live mix for the Underground Movement Show.

Let's kick things off with a quick rewind...how'd you get started making music?  Was it always something that you pegged as your future creative outlet, or did you get into it by catching DJ's or events when you were younger in Austria?

&lt;i&gt;It all began when I was listening to an Austrian Radio channel where they played music I have never hear before, it was progressive house I think and I recorded it on tape and shared it with my friends. I instantly wanted to do own mixes and share them. This way I found a new hobby which makes me happy until today! Later I had gigs in Austrian Clubs and started to produce my own music in the age of 17. My international career though began in the age of 21 after releases on Trapez, Traum and Stil Vor Talent.&lt;/i&gt;

What are your current projects?

&lt;i&gt;Currently I'm planning releases on my label FLASH Recordings, the next release will be "Warehouse 92 (Preview)" which I also dropped at my Sullivan Room Gig in New York City! Native Instruments released an Expansion pack "Static Friction" for MASCHINE last month which I have produced - this is very useful for Techno &amp; Tech-House and if you are a producer you should definitely check it out! There will also be fresh Loop releases on my Label Riemann Kollektion - I use the loops in my productions too of course!  The best way to be up to date with my music and loops etc. is to follow on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/florianmeindlartistpage" target="_new"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/florianmeindl" target="_new"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; 

Who would you say are your some of your primary influences in starting your career and how would you say they've impacted your own sound?  Anyone in particular that you'd cite as one of your defining inspirations?

&lt;i&gt;The first inspirations came from Axis Rec., Drumcode, Cocoon, Systematic, Raum...Musik - my sound got also influenced by 70s funk and Jazz as well as Pop Music, but there is often a desire to sound different and futuristic or freaked out, at least in my Techno tracks. The buildup of a track is also very important to me, the dramaturgy and flow must be perfect - this can cost me a lot of time in the studio unfortunately. Richie Hawtin always pushed boundaries and I can name him as the biggest influence, but also Jeff Mills is a big artist and Sven Väth is a master of celebration and reinvention.&lt;/i&gt;

Your sound is really unlike any other artist we've heard...it's got this incredibly rich combination of intricate patterns, deep swing, and driving, shifting percussion. There's a real journey to your tracks for the listener or dancer, including some of your latest releases on Flash such as "Get Down," "Chicago Flash," your recently released remix of Mingdgamers' "Once Again," and more. Would you agree that you're, for lack of a better phrase, looking to take your listeners on a trip?  How would you define your style in comparison to other electronic music that's out there?

&lt;i&gt;I want to catch them and take them on a journey, there are many tracks which sound great when you listen 5 seconds, but the buildup is another strong means of expression isn't it? For me it's not enough to make a good loop and include 2 breaks and only use copy and paste - for me there must be a movement within. I try to perform my next productions with Ableton Live and my controllers to bring a bit more life inside maybe - I'm experimenting a lot right now to shape my sound further.&lt;/i&gt;

In addition to running the successful FLASH label, you've actually also completed a degree at the London College of Music as well - what are some of the positives (as well as possible negatives) that you can share in getting this type of additional education with regards to your own music and running the label?  Would you recommend it to aspiring DJ's and producers and/or those looking to start their own labels?

&lt;i&gt;It was already 3 years ago since I finsihed my studies at the London College of Music (Now renamed into University of West London) - to be honest, running the label and doing many gigs besides studying was pretty hard, but I can recommend to do new courses and education because you gain new knowledge, meet new people and get inspired! I meet many producers here in Berlin and exchange knowledge which is very inspiring too!

Starting an own label is tough, but if you have a good network, outstanding music and you desperately want to do it and you feel that there is a need for you new unique idea then just do it! The important thing is that it's something special or you are convinced it is better than most label - because otherwise you might get stuck in the big mass of labels which is depressing of course - then you better invest this time to make only good music and try to get it to a label you like.&lt;/i&gt;

What's coming up next for FLASH Recordings and Florian?  How are you guys looking to take on Berlin and the rest of the world through this year and beyond?

&lt;i&gt;There will be a bit more Techno releases on FLASH incl. Artists like Electric Rescue, Maxime Dangles, Heron and of course myself. I'm also pushing my Loops &amp; Samples label Riemann Kollektion to the next level with one release per month and guest producers like Pan-Pot, Popof, Ramon Tapia etc.

I'm also working on a yet secret live act and will have an EP on Stephan Bodzin's Herzblut imprint and an EP on Sullivan Room Rec. (NYC) incl. a Marco Bailey Remix. There will also a Remix for English Dj legend Darren Emerson on Bedrock!&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;More About Florian Meindl&lt;/strong&gt;

Florian Meindl is a DJ, producer and sound designer from Austria, based in Berlin. In addition to numerous collaborations with international artists he is busy with producing remixes (for Röyksopp, Hot Chip, Dave Seaman…), running his label FLASH Recordings and composing new music. He has successfully completed his BA studies at the London College of Music where his Loops &amp;amp; Samples brand "Riemann Kollektion" was found. By now you can find 20 releases with many guest producers such as Pan-Pot, Shlomi Aber, Christian Smith, Popof, Wehbba and Ramon Tapia.

Till now his productions have been released on labels such as Trapez, Herzblut, K7, Kling Klong, Tronic, EMI France, Wall of Sound, Boxer, Hell Yeah, Great Stuff and his own imprint FLASH Recordings.

If you ask Florian about the origin of his exceptional career, he will describe it as an "early identification with electronic music" which occurred in a small village in beautiful Upper Austria. In the age of 13 he bought his first House Record and in the age of 16 he played already in local clubs as a warmup act for big import DJs. His international career took off when he released on Trapez in 2006 and collaborated with Berlin head honcho Oliver Koletzki.

From his home-base Berlin he tours the world's top clubs, his DJ sets are known more than anything else for his precision in creating driving, surprising and diversified DJ sets. Closely following the present development, this demanding representative of the next generation of electronic music is presently focussing on the expansion of his international work.

Every year Florian is working on a main project, on a milestone, in 2012 it clearly was his debut album WAVES – this year he will move into the new "Riverside Studios" and start new collaborations - watch out and be up to date with Florian’s Twitter @florianmeindl.

                    <itunes:summary>FLASH and Thunder:

One of the ER staff's favorite techno and tech-house producers the last few years, and yet this prolific and talented European artist is not well enough known in the US.  We're here to change that dammit, starting right now.  It's Berlin by way of London and Austria.  It's FLASH Recordings (his own label) by way of Trapez, Suara, Resopal, Great Stuff, Traum, and too many others to name here.  It's Florian Meindl with a massive live 2 hour set at Propaganada!  Big shouts to the Sullivan Room crew, Sr. Serge, and Gene Meandisco for making this one happen.

We guarantee you, you cannot listen to this mix without searching out Florian's music immediately afterwards. Double dog dare ya.

And did we mention, we were able to grab Florian himself for an exclusive interview after his gig?  Keep it scrollin' (but first click 'play').


 ER's Exclusive Interview with Florian Meindl

Florian, thanks so much for joining us here on ElectronicRhythm.com, and for your exclusive live mix for the Underground Movement Show.

Let's kick things off with a quick rewind...how'd you get started making music?  Was it always something that you pegged as your future creative outlet, or did you get into it by catching DJ's or events when you were younger in Austria?

It all began when I was listening to an Austrian Radio channel where they played music I have never hear before, it was progressive house I think and I recorded it on tape and shared it with my friends. I instantly wanted to do own mixes and share them. This way I found a new hobby which makes me happy until today! Later I had gigs in Austrian Clubs and started to produce my own music in the age of 17. My international career though began in the age of 21 after releases on Trapez, Traum and Stil Vor Talent.

What are your current projects?

Currently I'm planning releases on my label FLASH Recordings, the next release will be "Warehouse 92 (Preview)" which I also dropped at my Sullivan Room Gig in New York City! Native Instruments released an Expansion pack "Static Friction" for MASCHINE last month which I have produced - this is very useful for Techno &amp; Tech-House and if you are a producer you should definitely check it out! There will also be fresh Loop releases on my Label Riemann Kollektion - I use the loops in my productions too of course!  The best way to be up to date with my music and loops etc. is to follow on Facebook or Twitter 

Who would you say are your some of your primary influences in starting your career and how would you say they've impacted your own sound?  Anyone in particular that you'd cite as one of your defining inspirations?

The first inspirations came from Axis Rec., Drumcode, Cocoon, Systematic, Raum...Musik - my sound got also influenced by 70s funk and Jazz as well as Pop Music, but there is often a desire to sound different and futuristic or freaked out, at least in my Techno tracks. The buildup of a track is also very important to me, the dramaturgy and flow must be perfect - this can cost me a lot of time in the studio unfortunately. Richie Hawtin always pushed boundaries and I can name him as the biggest influence, but also Jeff Mills is a big artist and Sven Väth is a master of celebration and reinvention.

Your sound is really unlike any other artist we've heard...it's got this incredibly rich combination of intricate patterns, deep swing, and driving, shifting percussion. There's a real journey to your tracks for the listener or dancer, including some of your latest releases on Flash such as "Get Down," "Chicago Flash," your recently released remix of Mingdgamers' "Once Again," and more. Would you agree that you're, for lack of a better phrase, looking to take your listeners on a trip?  How would you define your style in comparison to other electronic music that's out there?

I want to catch them and take them on a journey, there are many tracks which sound great when you listen 5 seconds, but the(continued)</itunes:summary>

                    <title>Underground Movement Show - Episode 107 - Quadruplos Live PA / Tanya &amp; Marlon Live PA</title>
                    <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/83/19/38/altruistrecordings/1400x1400_8530861.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a chance to catch both Tanya &amp; Marlon as well as Quadruplos at Iceland Airwaves last year, and so were eager to get them over to these shores this summer (playing for the first time in New York in about a decade!) with the collaboration with one of ER's favorite NYC friends, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/mrianyc" target="_new"&gt;Blysk of MRIA&lt;/a&gt;! 

With an epic cross-cultural exchange of the subwoofer, each live act took their beats to the next level on the main floor of the Delancey during this very special event.  Reminiscent of the old WARP records days, we were so happy to be able to preserve this epic night for the interwebs of the future - bass flowers bloom.  And go BOOM.  A couple of our favorite sets and events of the summer - for your eyes and ears only!

&lt;strong&gt;Tanya &amp; Marlon&lt;/strong&gt;

Tanya &amp; Marlon are cousins and best friends since birth, who spent their free time in youth running around the streets of 101RVK like little wildlings, hustlin' candy and breaking out at night to stand outside of venues just to listen to the music. They knew in themselves that one day they would be the ones to make everybody dance &amp; be happy.

It all started when they were 12. Old samplers, kids toys, casio keyboards and anything they could get their hands on to serve their free spirits and spaced out imaginations, while still keeping it real. By 15 they had upgraded their equipment and matured in their composition - soon thereafter they began touring America, England and Eastern Europe on a regular basis and they financed these tour adventures by printing their own CDs &amp; selling them at their gigs.

Formerly known as Anonymous &amp; more recently PLX, Tanya &amp; Marlon have been a part of the electronic scene for more than half their lives and come this fall they are set to explode their first proper album release in Iceland on Möller Records.

Tanya is the co-founder of Weirdcore, along with Biogen (who passed away early 2011). With their minds combined, starting in 2005, they revived the electronic scene hosting monthly events and releasing compilations to introduce all the genres of electro to the masses. With Tanya's vision intact, Weirdcore continues to blossom.

Marlon is also known well for being one of the best &amp; fastest thinking rappers in Iceland, known for his upper level lyrics, mad freestyling skills and intergalactic depth.

Tanya &amp; Marlon have a solid rep for giving an epic performance with unique stage presence &amp; otherworldly beats. As music has been a part of what connects them so long, their passion on stage is evident with every sound they make and they will forever continue to bring the beats &amp; keep spreading the positive vibe.

&lt;strong&gt;Quadruplos&lt;/strong&gt;

Since releasing their debut album on kimi records in 2010, Quadruplos have been burning stages at home and abroad with gnarly sets of grinding grimy electro, to both popular and critical acclaim. Their next project, set for release in october/november this year, sees the duo tuning down to a more trip-hop tempo, while maintaining the intensity of sound for which they rapidly became known.

Owen Howells Bio:


It takes drive, gritty determination and passion to stand out in today’s musical climate – but that’s not all. What are also needed are raw musical talent, skill and creativity - the certain attributes that Owen Howells possesses in abundance. The London based DJ, Producer and record label boss is accustomed to putting the hours in needed to shine proudly. Blending classic house rhythms with dense, contemporary shades of sub bass influences, the prolific name in the global electronic music scene is never short of a project or three to keep him busy.

Releases on Wunderkammer, Trendy Mullet, Sounds of Juan and his own label Shades (formerly Shades of Grey) galvanise his reputation for being an aspiring producer with many tastes to incorporate. Whether its stepping, snare laced house, or heads down peak time rollers, Owen’s music – both as part of the Shades collective and through his on solo productions – keeps the underground bubbling, in turn catching the eye of many a folk right across the electronic music spectrum and earning support from Mary Anne-Hobbs, Kerri Chandler, MANDY, Gavin Herlihy, Luke Solomon and George Fitzgerald right through to some of techno’s finest innovators and purists such as Eric Cloutier, Voigtmann, Bruno and many more. Maybe that’s why his sheen as a producer earns him regular spots in the Top 10 Beatport charts; or maybe it’s his musical vision of exploring the grey areas and deftly connecting the dots between contemporary electronic music genres, blending a range of tempos and styles to suit the most discerning of dance floors.

Described as ‘genre agnostic ‘by i-DJ mag, Owen has progressively immersed himself in a mixture of house, techno and beyond throughout his musical experiences, with the young master Howells citing his exposure to the UK’s pirate radio network as a major inspiration, as well as infamous clubs such as The End and the skilfully crafted and programmed sets of DJs such as Ryan Elliot as he grew up between London and Adelaide. A spirited raver at heart, it’s his years at the forefront of club-land and encyclopaedic knowledge of music that makes up the backbone of Owen’s approach to his work and this same passion that he takes everywhere with him, whether its performing his monthly Fiendkast podcast, playing for Beatport’s Live Stream in Berlin or embarking on enduring sets around the best international clubs available today.

Owen started running the successful and burgeoning Shades of Grey event in Brixton in London, with friends Duct, Fybe:one and Trinomic also at the helm of this successful and low-key forward thinking electronic music den. Eventually, though, the night morphed into a record label, with The Shades of Grey record label exploring the concept of the night by pledging to release all the different types of music that they liked to hear. The Shades collective is an evolving vehicle for Owen to deliver his unique blend of techno, house and more, all rooted by a central theme of low-end bass within his progressive, expanding cannon of sound. But as a solo artist, his output is just as consistent; just check out his recent work for Danza Macbra, of which Resident Advisor described as “a dubby effort that works with heavy, reversed sonics and a looped chord pattern, quickening the pulse through bell hits, mumbled words and subtle manipulation of its elements that weave a hypnotic spell”. 

Now based in Deptford, South of the river Thames, when he’s not producing records, the obsession vinyl junkie will be found weaving together eclectic and un-hindered DJ sets, regularly digging through for rare grooves, techno classics and more contemporary strains of electronica, which he’s brought to the likes of Czech Republic, Australia, Malta and Berlin. A North American Tour is in the midst in 2013, aside from many more regular club and festival dates across Europe and his new affiliation with Berlin based Van Morgan booking agency. A true grass-roots operation – subsequently gaining a loyal support and following from across the board – this DIY attitude and labour of love is helping the young name rise, with Owen regularly delivering podcasts and mixes for the likes of Mixmag, Data Transmission, Pulse Radio and his own regular series,www.fiendkast.com

Resident Advisor - 'a dubby effort that works with heavy, reversed sonics and a looped chord pattern, quickening the pulse through bell hits, mumbled words and subtle manipulation of its elements that weave a hypnotic spell.'

Data Transmission - 'in the midst of his steady climb toward truly widespread appreciation, with a no-doubt bright and exciting future ahead for this hotly tipped artist, just remember folks, you heard it here first!’

Mixmag - 'an eclectic approach combining low key house with a bass music sensibility.' / 'swirling, atmospheric track, introverted and detailed, growing from a deep house track into something more percussive and dancey.'

Ibiza Voice - 'This is a wiked release.'

Beatport - 'Common People is a whole ‘nother animal, one which he’s taken and twisted into one of the darkest techno tunes of the year.'

                    <title>Underground Movement Show - Episode 105 - Gel Abril</title>
                    <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/ts/83/19/38/altruistrecordings/1400x1400_8394237.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Gel Abril come a knockin'....the entire city be a rockin'. We found ourselves in NYC recently with Mr. Abril, joining the Israeli artist as he rolled into the Big Apple on one of its most renowned dance floors, Sullivan Room.  Mr. Abril gave an enthralled crowd a signature set with his blend of high-energy platters.  Check out his full set and others from the evening on ElectronicRhythm.com


&lt;strong&gt;More about Gel Abril:&lt;/strong&gt;

Talking about the new age of techno, Gel Abril a.k.a Roy Brizman has been undoubtedly one of the most present names on the underground movement's lips. Debuting with remixes for Shlomi Aber on labels such as "Ovum" (Freakside) and "Renaissance" (Moods), Gel started building his own profile with original material for his home based label, the Be As One Imprint. 

Thanks to the success of releases such as "Sparta" - with his fellow rising star from Tel Aviv, Itamar Sagi - and above all his first hit "Very Wrong", Gel soon got into the techno rumble, as testified by the huge support given to his tracks by a worldwide group of top crossover DJ's.

In a short period of time, major labels started to keep their eyes on Gel's unique profile and music approach, as testified by Ovum's label boss Josh Wink, who soon signed "The Underground Bullshit" EP. The record instantly hit as a top 10 seller and found its way in every major player's records case, with names such as Ricardo Villalobos, Laurent Garnier, Shlomi Aber, Luciano, Wink and many others. It was the German-based label Get Physical that then took Gel soaring to higher grounds ,with the "Miranda" EP.

From the very start of his promising career, Gel has been established as one of the most influential DJ's and producers of recent times, with release upon release becoming an industry trademark. One of his first footprints, "Your Face Is A Mess" on Be As One, has become one of the past winter's biggest anthem. Pushing forward with this wave of success, Gel released an even bigger follow up, the dance floor stormer "Spells of Yoruba / Marir" EP, which once again came out under Shlomi Aber's Be As One Imprint.

More about Gel Abril:

Talking about the new age of techno, Gel Abril a.k.a Roy Brizman has been undoubtedly one of the most present names on the underground movement's lips. Debuting with remixes for Shlomi Aber on labels such as "Ovum" (Freakside) and "Renaissance" (Moods), Gel started building his own profile with original material for his home based label, the Be As One Imprint. 

Thanks to the success of releases such as "Sparta" - with his fellow rising star from Tel Aviv, Itamar Sagi - and above all his first hit "Very Wrong", Gel soon got into the techno rumble, as testified by the huge support given to his tracks by a worldwide group of top crossover DJ's.

In a short period of time, major labels started to keep their eyes on Gel's unique profile and music approach, as testified by Ovum's label boss Josh Wink, who soon signed "The Underground Bullshit" EP. The record instantly hit as a top 10 seller and found its way in every major player's records case, with names such as Ricardo Villalobos, Laurent Garnier, Shlomi Aber, Luciano, Wink and many others. It was the German-based label Get Physical that then took Gel soaring to higher grounds ,with the "Miranda" EP.

From the very start of his promising career, Gel has been established as one of the most influential DJ's and producers of recent times, with release upon release becoming an industry trademark. One of his first footprints, "Your Face Is A Mess" on Be As One, has become one of the past winter's biggest anthem. Pushing forward with this wave of success, Gel released an even bigger follow up, the dance floor stormer "Spells of Yoruba / Marir" EP, which once again came out under Shlomi Aber's Be As One Imprint.

Recently, Gel remixed Dennis Ferrer's track "Sinfonia Della Notte" on Strictly Rhythm, and Spells of Yoruba has found a release on the mighty Defected label, featured as a single alongside new remixes on top. And te remix Gel did for Slam's "Variance" on Paragraph has been getting massive support from all the top key players in the scene. Meanwhile, Danny Tenaglia, Steve Lawler, Dennis Ferrer, Agoria and Valentino Kanzyani among others, have all knocked on Gel's door to get his tracks licensed for compilations.  As Part of the Be As One label showcase, and as one of the imprint's main artists, Gel has been trotting from the east to west sides of the globe, keeping the musical quality high and the underground musical tradition alive.
